Speciation in mangroves  are Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophora mucronata distinctly separate species   Understanding speciation is a central issue in evolutionary biology ever since Darwin s  1859  work on the origin of species  After a century s research on the factors and evolutionary processes leading to population diversification and formation of a new species  it is now generally accepted that  in the absence or restricted migration gene flow  as often facilitated by geographical isolation   conspecific populations diverge in genetic composition via the mechanisms of natural sexual selection  random genetic drift  and mutations  Genetic diversification can accumulate to the extent that the previous conspecifics appear to be morphologically different in different habitats or locations  and hence recognized by taxonomists as distinctly separate species  even if they can still interbreed and produce fertile progeny when occurring in sympatry  This scenario of geographic or ecological diversification could be the underlying cause of taxonomic confusions  Here  I use a close pair of sibling taxa Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophora mucronata as an example to explore the role of geography and ecology in explaining their observed morphological and genetic variation in the Indo West Pacific region  This study shows that documenting species diversity in conservation practice needs to be guided by a deep understanding of the dynamic speciation process   how geographic  ecological and genetic factors interact to create new morphs  and whether to treat them as separate species or as ecotypes or subspecies of the same species  
Rapid evolution at the edge  selection on life history traits during experimental range expansions Species ranges are rarely static  Shifts in species ranges have been especially pronounced in the context of global climatic changes and other anthropogenic environmental modifications  However  understanding and predicting the dynamics of ranges  which is highly relevant to both basic and applied research  has proven to be difficult  In principle  population spread can be described as a function of three basic processes  which can be linked by trade offs  dispersal  reproduction and density dependence  Empirical evidence and a growing number of theoretical studies suggest that these three processes are subject to rapid evolutionary changes during invasions  This may lead to an acceleration of the populations spread  Yet  experimental evidence that substantiates these claims remains scarce  We here present experimental evidence for the concurrent evolution of dispersal and other life history traits   such as growth rate  equilibrium density and morphological parameters   during replicated invasions in microcosms of the ciliate Tetrahymena sp  In accordance with previous empirical studies and theoretical predictions we found that invasions select for higher individual velocities and dispersal rates  This was accompanied by changes in morphology  individuals at expanding range fronts showed larger and slightly more elongated cells  In addition  experimental invasions also impacted growth rates and fundamentally changed density regulation within replicated populations  We not only observed that growth rates were higher at expanding range fronts but also found an increase in equilibrium population size  Together  these findings underline that invasion and range expansion cannot exclusively be studied from an ecological perspective  but must include evolutionary dynamics  
The preliminary genome landscape of the hybrid Italian sparrow and its parents  The Italian sparrow  Passer italiae  has been shown to be of hybrid origin resulting from hybridizations between the house sparrow  P  domesticus  and Spanish sparrow  P  hispaniolensis   Homoploid hybrid speciation is thought to be rare in animals with just a handful of well documented cases  and we aim at understanding more of the underlying genomics of this mode of diversification  Recently  we have assembled a denovo reference genome and constructed a linkage map for the most ubiquitos the parent species  the house sparrow  With subsequent re sequencing of reference populations  we are doing a whole genome landscape analysis of the hybrid Italian sparrow and its parents  Preliminary results from these analyzes will be presented   
Social context of disease resistance  Interactions among social and individual immune defense mechanisms in honey bees  Organisms have evolved numerous defenses to resist or tolerate parasitic infection  including both individual physiology and structural based defenses and behavioral  group level defenses  The over arching goal of this research is to examine the social context of parasite resistance mechanisms and better understand the evolution of physiological and behavioral immunity in social systems  There is a paucity of information concerning how the suite of individual and social defenses interact to affect parasite transmission and colony fitness in honey bees  Since multiple defenses can act against the same parasite  how do colonies invest in these differing defenses  Determining the potential costs and benefits of maintaining both individual and social immune defenses and any trade offs that exist among them is key to understanding disease resistance in a social context  Colonies were established with varying levels of genetic diversity  each headed by a queen that mated with 4 30 males   Analyses were conducted to determine a colony s ability to resist disease  the fungal pathogen Chalkbrood   level of hygienic behavior  diseased brood removal   grooming rates  level of antimicrobial resin collection both prophylactically and in response to a pathogen challenge  and larval immune response to a bacterial pathogen  Results suggest that there are no clear trade offs among the social immune traits measured and specifically that hygienic behavior and resin use is decoupled in honey bees  However hygienic behavior and larval immune response to a bacterial challege was positively correlated suggesting that these traits may be linked  The role of genetic diversity influencing these traits was modest at the levels examined in this study  The results indicate that the mechanism by which genetically diverse colonies are better able to resist disease as compared to likely stems from a combination of both individual and social immunity  and we found no clear trade offs among the different traits that can contribute to colony health   
Resolving the Phylogenetic Relationships of the Carnivorous Plant Genus Sarracenia using Gene Target Enrichment  The adaptation of plant carnivory to survive in nutrient poor habitats has evolved at least six times in flowering plants  While phylogenies currently exist for many of these groups  the evolutionary relationships of one of the more well studied carnivorous plants  Sarracenia  remain largely unclear  Previous attempts at constructing a phylogeny for the genus have been unable to resolve polytomies  most likely due to a recent adaptive radiation compounded with frequent ongoing hybridization between species  Together these processes can result in high levels of gene tree discordance more frequently than expected  Multilocus data can mitigate these issues  increasing the numbers of loci sequenced is expected to lead to more precise model parameters and therefore increase nodal support values in phylogenetic analyses  Here  we used target enrichment of 287 genes across 71 accessions of the genus  representing the 11 species listed in Mellichamp and Case  2009   and a combination of 10 putative infraspecific taxa listed by Mellichamp and Case  2009  and McPherson and Schnell  2011   and 2 outgroups within the family Sarraceniaceae on an Illumina HiSeq platform  Species tree estimations were conducted using multiple phylogenetic analyses  e g  MP EST  STEM hy   BEAST   Results from these coalescent approaches show support for many of the relationships within the genus with high resolution  Specifically  the genus consists of two subclades  The first subclade comprises S  purpurea  S  rosea  S  minor  S  psittacina  and S  flava  with the last two as sister taxa which supports previous results  Sarracenia oreophila  S  alata  S  leucophylla  S  alabamensis  S  jonesii  and S  rubra comprise the second subclade  The Sarracenia purpurea complex is monophyletic  while many accessions of the Sarracenia rubra complex  i e  S  rubra ssp  gulfensis and S  rubra ssp  wherryi resulted in a polytomy with S  alata this may be due to hybridization or possibly incomplete lineage sorting within the S  rubra complex  Understanding these relationships can better facilitate future research on the evolution of carnivory  In addition  this study highlights the use of multilocus data and multiple accessions in elucidating evolutionary relationships among recently radiated or hybridizing taxa  
Gene expression during parasitoid adaptation to symbiont conferred resistance  Parasitoids are organisms which require  but ultimately kill  a host for reproduction  Thus there is strong reciprocal selection for the hosts to avoid parasitism and the parasitoids to successfully reproduce  In these systems  rapid experimental evolution has been observed such that parasitoids may overcome a static host defense system in just a few generations  The parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum lays eggs within the black bean aphid  Aphis fabae   to develop  this egg must overcome not only the aphid immune system  but also defenses of a protective endosymbiont  Hamiltonella defensa    It is this bacterial defense that largely prohibits parasitoids from developing  To investigate the basis of rapid parasitoid evolution  we have experimentally evolved lines of L  fabarum  on three aphid hosts  two lines of aphids housing different endosymbiont isolates and a third line which lacks a protective bacterium  After just 10 generations  we observed an increased ability for wasps to infect the symbiont protected aphid lines on which they have evolved  To explore the genomic basis of this adaptation  we are employing RNAseq to investigate shifts in gene expression associated with increased infectivity  
Dynamics of evolutionary innovations in cancer  Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate  Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis  Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few  driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random  passenger mutations   a natural consequence of cancers elevated mutation rate  Some passengers can be deleterious to cancer cells  yet have been largely ignored in cancer research  In population genetics  however  the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown  Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug of war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers  These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression that is described by a critical population size  below which most lesions fail to progress  and a critical mutation rate  above which cancers meltdown  We find support for the model in cancer age incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers  We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to rationalize successes and failures of different treatment strategies We find that a tumors load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies  Collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target  We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by both current and future therapies  
Battle of the sexes  may the best fly win in reproduction  Males and females often have differing reproductive strategies to increase their individual fitness  which can result in sexual conflict   Males usually increase their fitness by mating multiply  while repeated mating comes at a high cost to females   Polyandrous females can receive indirect benefits of multiple mating by increasing the fitness of their offspring through additive and non additive genetic effects  such as good genes or compatible genes  These benefits are acquired through mechanisms of sexual selection which can act at many levels  behavioural through female mate choice  or postmating through sperm competition and cryptic female choice   To tease apart the antagonistic relationship between males and females in sexual reproduction  males from D  melanogaster isolines were ranked for their quality using a variety of fitness traits   The performance of high and low quality males were then tested for their fertilization success independently  cryptic female choice   in the presence of competition  sperm competition   and via female mate choice   These different aspects of sexual selection at both pre  and postmating levels were examined to determine how they contribute to overall male mating success  providing insight into how populations evolve in response to sexual selection      
Genome wide analysis reveals rapid genetic changes in natural Brassica rapa populations following drought Determining the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is a major goal in biology   We analyzed genome wide genetic differences between ancestors and descendants of natural populations of Brassica rapa that previously evolved changes in multiple phenotypic traits following drought   Site frequency spectrum analyses revealed several locations in the genome with evidence of recent soft selective sweeps in descendants   We found many genes with outlier FST values between ancestors and descendants   Several of these genes have functions related to traits like stress response and flowering time that make them particularly likely targets of recent selection by drought   The changes in allele frequencies that we found at many loci provide definitive evidence of genetically based rapid evolution in these natural populations   Our results suggest that these evolutionary changes were driven by selection acting on standing variation in multiple genes underlying traits of adaptive significance 
Recent divergence in fungal populations  Genetic differentiation between populations  signaling the effects of reduced gene flow and adaptation that are the main drivers of speciation  is essential to understanding biodiversity  Very little is currently known about how fungal populations differentiate in nature  Here  we investigate the divergence of a coastal and a mountain population of Suillus brevipes  a widespread mycorrhizal fungus associated with pine forests  Whole genome assembly and resequencing of 28 S  brevipes individuals revealed 567 192 shared SNPs that supported two recently diverged populations  each with low genetic diversity  As expected  mean genome wide Fst is very low  indicating little overall population differentiation  However  genome wide scans for regions of high differentiation using 5kb windows  reveal several highly differentiated regions  that harbor eight genes coding for five known proteins associated with cellular processes and signaling  Demographic inference suggests the two populations are isolated  with no migration between the coast and mountain  Population genetic differentiation and adaptation can occur by natural selection or genetic drift  Tests of the ratio of non synonymous to synonymous mutations and identity of genes in the highly diverged regions may provide evidence of natural selection and suggest modes of adaptation  Further research including other mountain and coastal S  brevipes populations will be needed to identify the sources of the highly diverged regions  
The role of gene expression variation on climatic adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster  Background and relevance  Studying genetic responses and identifying mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary dynamics in natural populations  Adaptive mechanisms in response to climatic factors help us understand the evolutionary dynamics of populations  The interplay of temperature and photoperiod cues is vital for several biological processes in nature   Additionally  these factors serve as predictable proxies for climatic variation over various spatial and temporal scales  We are interested in understanding the role transcriptome expression variation plays in the potential for adaptation to these climatic variables  In addition to adaptation  we want to understand whether certain gene expression patterns are associated with increased performance and fitness in particular environments or under specific environmental conditions  Experimental design  We performed a whole genome expression screen for two natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster derived from high and low latitude sources in eastern North America  Both populations were placed for five days under four fully factorial variables  hot  29 ¡C  and cold  14 ¡C  temperatures and long  15 hrs Light  9 hrs Dark  and short day photoperiod  9 L  15 D  conditions  RNA was then extracted and sequenced from each of the four treatment combinations  The flies were also assayed to test their phenotypic stress response under heat shock  chill coma and starvation resistance after being placed in both field and lab conditions for a period of five days   Results  Phenotypic stress response results show that northern and southern populations of flies respond differentially to environmental cues  The data demonstrates that southern populations are generally more starvation tolerant  whereas northern populations are more resistant to heat shock   These phenotypic data are placed in the context of the molecular data from the whole genome expression screen  Using this transcriptomic data we are identifying candidate genes that show significant and differential genotype by environment interactions  and thus represent candidates in the adaptive response to climatic variation   The expression of these candidate genes will then be manipulated and direct effects on phenotype and fitness will be examined   Conclusion  This work combines phenotypic and genotypic data to answer questions of fitness and adaptation  Specifically  we are investigating 1  how the geographical origin of the population affects response to environmental cues and 2  how the variation in response is associated with variation in genotype   These investigations allow us to use genotypes to understand the potential adaptive basis of phenotypic responses  
Clonal genotype influences behavior and response to predators in invasive New Zealand mud snails  Potamopyrgus antipodarum   The success of introduced species is determined by traits under selection that influence their invasion success   Behavior can be an important determinant of the success of a non native species   In the New Zealand mud snail  Potamopyrgus antipodarum   behavior has been shown to be influential in predator avoidance  and behavior likely plays a role in dispersal  We investigated differences in behavior between different asexual clones of this species and compared introduced clones characterized by various levels of invasive ability and New Zealand native clones with respect to rheotactic  geotactic  photokinetic  and dispersal behaviors  We also examined the influence of predator detection on these behaviors  There was a significant difference in behaviors between clonal genotypes in each of the behaviors evaluated  Interestingly  the most invasive clone  US1  behaved most differently from the other clones demonstrating differences to other clones in all behaviors including a greater propensity to disperse  Differences between clones in their behavioral responses to the detection of fish predators were also found   These results indicate that there is a genotypic effect on behaviors in this freshwater snail  and this variation may help to explain why some clones are more invasive than others  
 Behavioral drive and behavioral inertia in the tropical lizard  Anolis cybotes   Behavior determines how organisms interact with their environment  and has long been posited as a pacemaker for evolutionary diversification  The classical view is that novel behaviors expose organisms to new selective pressures  in turn  driving  morphological and physiological evolution  Behavior can also restrain evolutionary change  The  behavioral inhibition  hypothesis suggests that some behaviors  such as thermoregulation  help organisms maintain a constant selective environment  obviating the need to adapt even in the face of changing environments  However  behavioral drive and inhibition are not necessarily mutually exclusive processes   in response to a changing environment  behavioral changes that keep a population in its ancestral niche with regard to one niche axis often will be accomplished by subjecting the population to novel selective pressures on a different niche axis  In this study we test the hypothesis that behavior simultaneously inhibits physiological evolution while impelling morphological evolution in the lizard  Anolis cybotes  a species that ranges from sea level to nearly 3000 meters on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola  We demonstrate that behavioral flexibility allows individuals to maintain a constant body temperature along two elevational transects  thus precluding the evolution of differences in thermal physiology  behavioral inhibition   We show that the behavioral change allowing lizards to maintain a constant body temperature is accomplished by altering the part of the environment they occupy  and test whether a shift in structural habitat use in turn impels morphological evolution  behavioral drive   We discuss the implications of our findings in the light of contemporary debates in evolutionary biology  
Simulation tests of probabilistic models for historical biogeography  DEC and DEC+J  Several phylogenetic models for historical biogeography are in widespread use  e g  character mapping  Dispersal Vicariance Analysis  DIVA   and Dispersal Extinction Cladogenesis  DEC   In addition  new models have become available  BayArea  and the variety of models implemented in the R package BioGeoBEARS  These include DEC+J  which adds founder event speciation to DEC  and DIVALIKE  a likelihood interpretation of DIVA  a DIVALIKE+J model is also available   There has been very little testing of biogeographical models against simulated data in the situation when the true model is substantially different than the assumed inference model  Also  all of the above models assume that the observed tree is the true tree  ignoring possible missing speciation extinction events  and dependence of speciation extinction rates on geographic range  These possibilities are taken into account by the GeoSSE and ClaSSE models  but at the cost of many more free parameters  which may strain typically small biogeographic datasets  To test the accuracy of DEC and DEC+J inference on datasets simulated under different biogeographical and SSE models  I jointly simulated phylogenies and geographic range under 6 macroevolutionary models  The first three assumed speciation extinction were independent of geographic range   1  Yule process  pure birth  no extinction    2  Birth Death  BD  process with extinction rate 1 3 of the speciation rate   3  BD process with extinction equal to speciation  The next three assumed an SSE model where the base speciation rate was multiplied by the number of areas occupied  and base extinction rate was divided by the number of areas occupied  This produced  4  SSE with speciation but zero extinction rate   5  SSE with with the base extinction rate 1 3 of the speciation rate  and  6  SSE with base rates of speciation and extinction equal  For each of the 6 macroevolutionary models  all combinations of low middle high values were used for these biogeographic parameters  d  rate of range expansion   e  rate of range contraction   and j  relative weight of founder events versus traditional DEC cladogenesis events at speciation   The datasets  138 parameter combinations  100 simulations each with 50 living species  were subjected to inference under DEC and DEC+J  DEC and DEC+J were distinguishable under all 6 models  except when j was very small and d very high  DEC artificially raises d and e when DEC+J is the true model  and shows significantly reduced accuracy in inferring ancestral range  These results indicate that the fact that DEC+J is favored over DEC by many empirical datasets is not likely to be an artefact of missing SSE processes  
 Microgeographic genetic structure of a resident songbird in British Columbia  Canada   Understanding how the landscape influences the genetic integrity of populations is crucial   Individual dispersal can be restricted by barriers which can affect microevolutionary processes such as gene flow and adaptation   A reduction in gene flow as a result of restricted dispersal can lead to isolated populations  and  over time divergence   Barriers occur at both macro   mountains  and micro   habitat fragmentation  geographic scales   Although birds have high dispersal potential  evidence suggests dispersal is restricted by barriers   Birds are also susceptible to changes in the environment so serve as ideal mobile indicators of habitat quality   In this study  microsatellite genetic markers were used to assess the spatial distribution of genetic variation of the black capped chickadee  Poecile atricapillus  in British Columbia  Canada   Using a landscape genetics approach  we revealed significant population structuring at a micro geographical scale   For example  two populations  Prince George and Fort St  James  in British Columbia were genetically distinct despite being separated by less than 120 km comprised of continuous habitat and lacking any obvious dispersal barriers   Genetic discontinuities identified at this scale suggest that even the smallest change within the landscape  i e  suitable habitat  microclimate  hybridization  can play a major role in population dynamics and ultimately  the evolutionary potential of a species   
Detecting Evolution in Action  Composite Likelihood Method for inferring Incomplete Selective Sweeps Using DNA Sequence Polymorphism  Detecting Evolution in Action  Composite Likelihood Method for inferring Incomplete Selective Sweeps Using DNA Sequence Polymorphism Ha My Thi Vy  Yuseob Kim Department of Life Science and Division of EcoScience  Ewha Womans University Ewhayeodae gil 52  Seodaemun gu  Seoul 120 750 Korea Email  yuseob@ewha ac kr Adaptive evolution of a species occurs when a rare mutation that produces an advantageous phenotype spreads across population by natural selection  How  when and where in the genome such an evolutionary event occurs is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology  It is possible to detect ongoing positive selection because it generates complex patterns of DNA sequence variation  1 2   When a beneficial mutation is on the way to fixation  individuals  homologous chromosomes  in the population are divided into two groups  one group of individuals carrying the beneficial allele with low polymorphism  high linkage disequilibrium  excess number of high frequency derived alleles nearby the locus under selection  and another group of individuals carrying the ancestral allele with neutral level and pattern of sequence variation  The population genetic difference between two groups is therefore considered as the signal of ongoing positive selection  Several tests have been proposed and conducted to detect this kind of signal  However  they do not offer robust statistical test with accurate estimates of strength of selection and the location of selection  In order to manage those obstacles  in this study  we propose a new statistical test  named Mapping Incomplete Sweep using Composite Likelihood test  MISCL   which detects ongoing positive selection based on the analytic prediction of sample configuration  We first derived the joint sampling probabilities for allele frequencies of two groups as a function of strength of selection and recombination rate  Then a parametric test is conducted to polymorphic sites which are most likely under ongoing selection  Tested against simulated data  this method yielded higher statistical power and more accurate parameter estimates compared to other available method  3   This procedure was also applied to Drosophila melanogaster genomes and discovered new candidate genes under ongoing positive selection  References 1  J  Maynard Smith  J Haigh  Gen Res  1974  23  23  2  Y  Kim  W  Stephan  Genetics  2002  160  765  3  B  Voight et al   PlosS Biology  2006  4  e72  
Tremendous tenrecs  curious convergence and distinctive disparity  Understanding patterns of variation in morphological diversity  such as convergence and disparity  remains a challenge in evolutionary biology  In particular  questions of convergence and the predictability of evolution are central to the long standing debate about the relative influences of historical contingency and determinism in evolutionary processes   Theoretical models indicate that some degree of convergence is expected by chance in most phylogenies  Therefore  quantitative analysis and explicit tests of superficial patterns are essential if we are to identify and understand significant cases of evolutionary convergence  However  most quantitative methods of identifying convergence were developed using relatively few groups for which detailed morphological and ecological data were already known  I want to test the wider applicability and usefulness of such quantitative methods by applying them to a new study group  Malagasy tenrecs appear to be both disparate from each other and convergent with other  insectivore  mammal species  However  previous studies have neither quantified the degree of convergence or disparity present in tenrecs nor attempted to identify reasons for the occurrence of these patterns   I m assessing the evidence for significant morphological disparity within tenrecs and convergences among tenrecs and other mammals using a combination of geometric morphometric techniques and phylogenetic comparative methods  Subsequently  I will establish whether there are correlations between morphologically similar species occupying convergent ecological niches  The methods developed in this work   quantification of previously subjective morphological patterns and assessment of correlations between ecological and phenotypic similarities   have useful applications in diverse research areas including functional diversity biodiversity monitoring and conservation  
Reliability of Estimating Phylogenies Using Quantitative Characters  Species are often studied using a set of quantitative multidimensional characters  for example their shape or their pattern of gene expression  These species can be represented then in a multidimensional space in which each dimension takes up the variation in each variable  In empirical studies  squared change parsimony is usually used to reconstruct the position of the internal nodes in this multidimensional space and pick the shortest possible topology  In this study we assess the reliability of this choice  In the simplest case  in which four species are studied  there are three possible topologies that can recover the correct unrooted phylogeny  We simulate the evolution of four species in the multidimensional space following one specific topology  then we try to reconstruct the correct phylogeny as one empirical study would do and check whether we choose the topology we have simulated or a different one  This method is analogous to the one used by Huelsenbeck and Hillis for molecular data  1993   In our simulations we use different combinations of branch lengths and we first use a Brownian motion model of evolution  so parsimony gives equivalent results to maximum likelihood  Felsenstein  1981   The results suggest a positive effect of the length of the central branch and the dimensionality over the phylogenetic reliability  Therefore  using more independent quantitative variables to describe the species increases the chances of obtaining the correct phylogeny  We also find long branch attraction when few dimensions are used  Much evolution in two terminal branches can overwrite the signal established by a long central branch  This effect is especially concerning when covariation between the quantitative variables  i e  integration  is assessed in the simulations  Integration decreases the effective dimensionality and therefore the reliability  which is poor with few dimensions  The attempts to transform the multidimensional space to take into account the account the integration and therefore to increase the reliability require big sample sizes  even in the unlikely situation in which the correct evolutionary integration pattern is known  Finally  stabilizing selection is also tested  The results are the worst in this situation  since convergence systematically happens  Unfortunately  both integration and stabilizing selection have been considered widespread features in the evolution of phenotypic quantitative characters  
Two Locus Hybrid Incompatibilities and the Introgression of Adaptive Alleles  The sources of genetic variation and their relative contributions to adaptation is a central topic in the study of evolution  and mounting evidence points to an important role for variation introduced through hybridization between species  Adaptive alleles introduced through hybridization must overcome barriers to gene flow  particularly those due to epistatically incompatible alleles  Current models of introgression lack an explicit treatment of incompatibility loci  Here  we analyze the situation in which hybridization generates a beneficial locus that is linked to a two locus genetic incompatibility using a multi locus Moran like model  We calculate both the likelihood of adaptive introgression and the likelihood that a linked incompatible variant hitchhikes to fixation  We contrast this model with one in which barriers to gene flow are due to extrinsically maladaptive loci  We determine that the influence of a genetic incompatibility on the probability of adaptive introgression depends strongly on the distances between the incompatible loci and the adaptive allele  Furthermore  we investigate the potential for adaptive introgression to erode barriers to gene flow between divergent populations  Our analysis supports the idea that the variation introduced through introgression is a potentially important source of adaptive alleles  
Polymorphic hybrid male sterility during the early stages of speciation  There are often multiple intrinsic barriers that isolate closely related species  and during the early stages of speciation  these barriers may vary both within and among populations  Polymorphism for alleles contributing to reproductive isolation may be an inevitable stage in speciation  yet there are few cases of well documented polymorphic incompatibilities  In the house mice alleles contributing to hybrid male sterility segregate within populations  Here use whole genome sequencing and quantitative genetic crosses within and between two subspecies of mice  M  m  musculus and M  m  domesticus  to dissect the basis of polymorphic incompatibilities within M  m  musculus  We identify three genomic regions that contribute to sterility phenotypes and two of these regions are independent of incompatibility loci identified in other crosses  These data underscore the surprisingly complex genetic basis of hybrid incompatibilities during the early stages of speciation in mice  
Runaway and good genes processes are not ends of a continuum  Biologists have long debated the evolution of animal ornamentation via female choice  Early in this discussion  a dichotomy in explanations emerged in which mate choice was proposed to be either adaptive  leading to the evolution of condition dependent signals of quality  or arbitrary  leading to the evolution of aesthetic traits   In recent reviews  the evolutionary processes leading to adaptive or arbitrary mate choice have been recast as ends of a continuum  I propose that ornamental traits that signal condition are distinct from arbitrary signals of attractiveness in degree of elaboration  in the information that they convey  and in the evolutionary processes through which they evolve   Condition dependent traits evolve as signals of respiratory efficiency and especially signals of mitonuclear compatibility   In contrast  aesthetic traits evolve as signals of species identity allowing females to choose mates with shared mitochondrial types   Once they are fixed in a population  arbitrary signals of species identity can be elaborated through a runaway sexual selection process into the gaudy traits displayed by some species   The outcome of these processes is two distinctly different types of ornaments that evolve to serve distinctly different signal function   Display traits can be fully understood only by embracing this dual nature of animal ornamentation   
Genetics of Ecological Specialization and Incipient Speciation in an Experimental Population of E  coli  In the absence of sexual reproduction  microbial species concepts emphasize ecological divergence rather than reproductive isolation as in Mayr s Biological Species Concept  BSC    Cohan s Ecotype Species Concept  ESC  identifies bacterial speciation with niche discovery mutations  NDMs  that permit invasion of a novel niche   In the new niche  a mutant lineage can pursue an evolutionary trajectory independent of its parent   This trajectory may involve the accumulation of mutations that improve fitness in the new niche while reducing fitness in the ancestral one   These niche specific adaptive mutations  NSAMs  promote ecological specialization   Because NSAM fitness benefits are dependent upon the presence of the NDM  they can also present barriers to successful inter ecotype horizontal gene transfer analogous to reproductive isolation  After 31 000 generations of an ongoing long term evolution experiment  LTEE  with E  coli carried out in glucose limited medium that also contains a large amount of citrate  we observed the evolution of an aerobic citrate using  Cit+  phenotype    This Cit+ phenotype transcends the accepted range of variation for E  coli  and permitted access to a large  previously unavailable resource   The Cit+ subpopulation rose to numerical dominance of the population  but a Cit  subpopulation persisted   Extensive whole genome sequencing has confirmed that the two subpopulations are divergent ecotypes   We have previously shown that the Cit+ lineage improved markedly in its fitness in DM25 through 40 000 generations while also losing fitness on glucose   This pattern strongly suggested that niche specific adaptive mutations  NSAMs  have been accruing in the Cit+ lineage   We identified a number of candidate NSAMs in evolved Cit+ genomes   We then used recombineering to move these candidates into Cit+ and Cit  genetic backgrounds  and examined their background dependent fitness effects   We identified a number of NSAMs that improve fitness in a Cit+ background  but reduced fitness in a Cit  one  including mutations in the citrate synthase  gltA  and isocitrate lyase  aceA  genes   These NSAMs provide a genetic basis for the ecological specialization observed in the Cit+ lineage  and further suggest that Cit+ is an incipient species under criteria that fit both the ESC and BSC  
When sex allocation theory and reality meet  Insights from size specific reproductive investment in an androdioecious barnacle  Why are species dioecious  hermaphroditic  sex changers or a combination of hermaphrodites and single sex individuals  In other words  what determines how individuals allocate reproductive resources into the male and female sex   Sex allocation theory explains the distribution of sexual systems by asking which sex allocation provides the highest fitness  These fitness maxima often differ for small and large individuals depending on the population wide sex allocation fitness relationship  Therefore we can use empirical measurements of size specific reproductive investment to infer the population wide relationship between sex allocation and fitness  However  being of a certain size may also convey direct fitness advantages  A common example is that large plants are able to disperse pollen further than small plants  even though both produce the same amount of pollen  In other words  large individuals have a higher fitness than small individuals  even though both have the same reproductive investment  In this case  size specific reproductive investment does not accurately reflect the sex allocation fitness relationship because fitness is increased in large individuals   We can test if sex allocation theory is sufficient to explain an observed size specific pattern of reproductive investment by comparing predictions made by sex allocation theory with empirical data   Sex allocation theory predicts that androdioecy  the coexistence of males and hermaphrodites  is evolutionarily stable only under a very particular relationship between sex allocation and fitness  Comparing these predictions for androdioecy with inferences made from size specific reproductive incestment shows that sex allocation alone cannot explain androdioecy in the commensal barnacle Chelonibia testudinaria  Instead  we conclude that males gain fitness through direct effects  which may be related to their dwarfed size and close proximity to hermaphrodites  
Sexual reproduction   epi mutagenesis and selective bottlenecks engender pre selected variation  The question as to why sexual reproduction is so ubiquitous is still unanswered in evolutionary biology  In a systems biology approach  my recent comprehensive work with 8 700 references  Heininger K  2013  The mutagenesis selection cascade theory of sexual reproduction  WebmedCentral REPRODUCTION 4  WMC004367  elaborated the ecological and molecular biological processes that render sexual reproduction the predominant mode of reproduction in multicellular organisms  Environments never remain static  They continuously undergo changes that alter the fitness landscapes  displacing populations towards suboptimal fitness regions  Stressed microorganisms resort to a bet hedging strategy  the evolutionary risk spreading response to uncertainty  gambling with their genome  However  since mutations are rather deleterious than beneficial  mutagenesis only pays when the mutators have large population sizes  What evolved as reactive process to environmental challenge  was accommodated as the proactive evolutionary tool of sexual reproduction  A multitude of both direct and indirect evidences reveal the metabolic oxidative stress  particularly in males  explaining e g  male biased mutation rates  lower temperature comfort zone of male fishes or mammalian testicular extra abdominal descent   under which higher taxa generate the genetic and epigenetic variation of gametes  The vast excess of mutant gametes is subjected to a cascade with various selective bottlenecks generating pre selected  epi genetic variation  Metabolic oxidative stress is also the effector of germ cell gamete quality control through cell competition  These selection principles are increasing mutational and environmental robustness and adaptation to life in general  rather than to any particular environment  Traditional concepts imply the action of stochastic bottlenecks during sexual reproduction  Mutagenic gamete overproduction  e g  during human lifetime ca  7 million female germ cells and 2 trillion mature sperm  and stochastic gamete bottlenecks  however  should have put sexually reproducing organisms at a substantial disadvantage  inevitably resulting in mutational meltdown and extinction  Along the phylogenetic axis  the oxidative stress during gametogenesis and the population size of gametes that is subjected to sexual selection cascades were increased and the population size of offspring that is exposed to natural selection was reduced  In resource limited habitats  the vast majority of habitats   offspring quantity quality trade offs are observed in sexually reproducing plants and animals and the theoretical twofold cost of sexual reproduction has no evolutionary meaning  In addition  the non linear  inverted  U  shaped sex stress relationship and the superior colonizing ability of asexuals explain the ecological distribution of sex asex  Since sexual reproduction is so pervasive in nature  deciphering its underlying mechanisms provides  as a corollary  insights into a variety of evolutionary conundrums and controversies  
 Estimating F statistics  Weir and Cockerham  Evolution  38 1358  1370  1984  updated   In a highly cited paper  Weir and Cockerham presented a method for estimating F statistics  primarily Fst  from genetic marker data  They stated explicitly that their method was for data from a series of independent populations with similar histories  in effect a star phylogeny  Under this model  their weighting of allele frequencies by sample sizes when averaging over populations was appropriate and gave rise to estimates with low bias and low variance  Actual populations are neither independent nor similar of course and a more general approach was given by Weir and Hill  Annual Review of Genetics 36 721 750  2002  but still using sample size weightings for averages over populations  Following a recent paper by Bhatia et al  Genome Research 23 1514 1521  2013   the earlier work has been re cast in terms of unweighted averages of sample heterozygosities  but for any number of populations and any number of alleles per locus  and an emphasis given to the estimation of Fst like measures within each population and between each pair of populations  The average of the within population measure reduces to the original Weir and Cockerham estimator if populations are independent  or if the sample sizes are the same for each population  The numerical difference between the new and original estimators is generally small  This work will be illustrated with human SNP and STR data  and its use in detecting signatures of natural selection will be discussed   Supported in part by NIH GM 075091   
Consistent genomic signatures of reproductive isolation in a hybrid zone responding to climate change  Studies of hybrid zone dynamics often investigate a single sampling period and draw conclusions from that temporal snapshot  but stochasticity can result in loci with patterns that differ from neutral expectations  Comparing admixed populations from different geographic regions is one way to detect consistently divergent regions potentially involved in reproductive isolation  Temporal comparisons address the same problem  but have not been investigated  In North America  black capped  Poecile atricapillus  and Carolina  P  carolinensis  chickadees hybridize in a contact zone extending from New Jersey to Kansas  The hybrid zone is likely maintained by strong intrinsic selection against hybrids  and it is moving north in response to climate change  We used a reduced representation genomic approach and temporally spaced sampling two samples of  80 individuals separated by a decade to determine the pattern and consistency of selection and introgression in the chickadee hybrid zone  We report consistently low introgression for highly divergent loci between P  atricapillus and P  carolinensis in this moving hybrid zone  This is strong evidence that these loci are linked to genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation between chickadees  This spatiotemporal genomic analysis highlights the benefits of examining hybrid zones at multiple time points  and in different geographic contexts  when investigating reproductive isolation between closely related species  
How to train your symbionts  the dynamics of domestication  Here we develop a general theory for the coevolution of transmission mode and virulence in host symbiont interactions  The fidelity of an interaction  determined by transmission mode  has a direct effect on the efficiency of selection  This new theory will combine models to understand the mechanisms of virulence evolution in structured populations  We find that interaction of virulence and genetic structure determines the balance between hosts escaping virulent pathogens and host symbiont coevolution reducing virulence  
Chromosomal Inversions and Speciation in Birds  Secondary contact drives genomic rearrangement  Birds have long been used as models of speciation and are the best studied group with respect to how behavior and ecology contribute to population divergence but an integrated evaluation requires an assessment of factors that drive post mating isolation as well  Despite strong evidence that chromosome rearrangements contribute to adaptation and speciation in other groups  the degree to which they do so in birds remains to be examined  Indeed  chromosome rearrangements have been dismissed as unimportant in avian evolution despite the paucity of study and some evidence to the contrary  The Old World finch family Estrildidae  order Passeriformes  provides an ideal system for studying variation in rates of chromosome evolution and the underlying factors responsible  The Estrildids comprise 141 morphologically and karyotypically diverse species broadly distributed across Africa  Asia  Australasia  and Melanesia  A phylogenetic approach to investigating the drivers of inversion evolution in Estrildids based on a combination of cytological  morphological  and biogeographical datawork shows that the rate of inversion evolution varies almost 4 fold between equivalently aged continental and island radiations  The fixation rate of inversions differs greatly between groups of Estrildids  inversions accumulate four times faster on average in continental groups  Rates of rearrangement are strongly correlated with range overlap of species and marginally with population size  My results support an adaptive model of karyotype evolution whereby gene flow between diverging populations establishes the selective advantage for chromosomal rearrangement   
Spatial niches influence biodiversity during adaptive radiation  Adaptive radiation  through which multiple species emerge from a single evolutionary lineage to utilize various ecological opportunities  is a major contributor to biodiversity   While adaptive radiation has  been observed in many natural communities  the role of spatial niches on biodiversity patterns during adaptive radiation has been rarely explored   The ecological theory of the storage effect suggests that variation of environmental conditions over space provides spatial niche opportunities for co occurring species  potentially allowing more species to coexist   We hypothesize that spatial niches may also influence biodiversity patterns over evolutionary timescales   We experimentally explored how spatial niches influence adaptive radiation  using the rapidly evolving bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 as the model organism   P  fluorescens undergoes rapid adaptive radiation under the static condition where specialized niches are available for new phenotypes to utilize  but not under the shaking condition where such niches are absent   By taking advantage of these characteristics  we constructed laboratory metacommunities each containing two local microcosms  incubated either under the same  shaking or static  conditions  or under different conditions   In addition  we also manipulated species dispersal  either allowing or not allowing exchange of individuals among the local communities   Our results showed that spatial niches and dispersal interactively affected P  fluorescens diversity   When there was no dispersal  spatial niches had little effect on either alpha diversity in local microcosms or beta diversity among microcosms   By contrast  when dispersal was present  spatial niches increased alpha diversity but reduced beta diversity   The spatial storage effect was responsible for the observed biodiversity patterns  Adaptation of P  fluorescens to different incubation conditions increased the niche difference between its phenotypes  promoting frequency dependent selection among them in metacommunities with spatial niches  Such frequency dependent selection facilitated phenotypic coexistence but weakened priority effects  resulting in the highest alpha diversity and lowest beta diversity in metacommunities characterized by both dispersal and spatial niches  These results highlight the importance of spatial niches in maintaining biodiversity in evolving metacommunities  
Intrasexual competition between females leads to aggression toward sexually receptive intruders in convict cichlids  Amatitlania siquia   While the role of intrasexual aggression between males in shaping mating dynamics has long been recognized  the role of female intrasexual aggression in the competition for mating opportunities is less well understood  Rather than competing for quantity of mates  females may instead compete for access to the benefits  such as parental care  that males provide  Unmated females may compete for access to already mated males and if this causes a reduction in the reproductive success of the primary female then selection should favor females that behave aggressively toward rival females  Increased aggression toward rival females can effectively maintain monogamy in simultaneous polygynous species and this same behavior may prevent male desertion in predominantly monogamous species  Convict cichlids  Amatitlania siquia  form monogamous pairs and provide up to six weeks of biparental care to their offspring  Sexually receptive females have distinctive coloration of black pigmentation with iridescent flecks of blue  orange  and yellow  These unpaired females actively court paired males guarding offspring  and parental males have been observed to desert their current brood in order to mate with the new female  To examine the role of aggression by parental females in maintaining their mating status  we conducted an experiment to investigate whether parental females respond differently to a confined intruder depending on the intruder s reproductive status  Parental females responded more aggressively to sexually receptive females compared to non reproductive females  Sexual receptivity of the confined intruder did not affect aggression levels toward other nearby fish  indicating that parental females did not increase their overall level of aggression when presented with a sexual rival but directed their attacks only toward the perceived threat  By increasing their behavioral response toward sexual rivals  parental females may be able to mitigate threats to their breeding status  The number of offspring reaching independence decreases under female only care  and thus females have a strong incentive to maintain the pair bond as long as possible  Increased aggression toward sexual rivals may play an important role in the maintenance of monogamy  which will aid in females maximizing their reproductive success for the breeding event  
Evolution of leaf defenses in relation to environment and leaf economics across the genus Helianthus  Leaf defenses are physical or chemical traits that act to prevent herbivory  Because plant growth is ultimately limited by resource availability  plants are known to balance resource allocation to growth and defense in response to the environment  where species from low resource environments typically have slower growth and higher defense  and species from higher resource environments typically have faster growth and lower defense  Variation in growth rate strategies is well described by the concept of the leaf economics spectrum  though to date this paradigm has largely ignored leaf defenses  This is curious  as many common traits considered defensive are either directly or indirectly involved in leaf economics  as defenses directly influence leaf lifespan and the initial leaf carbon and nitrogen investment  Unlike LES traits  leaf defenses have not been found to form a unified global axis of variation  rather  many different defense trait combinations can be employed to achieve a similar goal of reducing herbivory  While no evidence has been found for global syndromes of leaf defense across broad collections of plant families  it has been proposed that trade offs could exist at lower levels of organization  such as within diverse genera  This study uses a phylogenetic comparative approach to investigate leaf defenses across wild sunflowers  the genus Helianthus  to explore the potential for evolutionary trade offs between physical and chemical defenses  latitudinal and environmental gradients in defenses  and the relationship between leaf defenses and the leaf economic spectrum  Focal defense traits include leaf thickness  toughness  trichome density  tannin activity  lipid content  ash content  and leaf dry matter content  
Computing the Quartet Distance for Sets of Heterogeneous Phylogenetic Trees  Modern gene tree and supertree methods produce sets of phylogenetic trees containing dissimilar  heterogeneous  sets of taxa  In order to understand the relationships between the trees distance methods are a powerful tool  The popular Robinson Foulds  RF  distance is not usable in the heterogeneous case due to its reliance on bipartitions  The quartet distance is not subject to these constraints  This talk describes a new algorithm  QuickQuartetHet for determining the all pairs quartet distance for sets of heterogeneous phylogenetic trees  Experimental results on biological data verify that the algorithm performs within a constant factor of the existing QuickQuartet algorithm  In order to better understand the impact of heterogeneity synthetic trees were generated with varying levels of heterogeneity and experiments performed to show that even small levels of heterogeneity have large impacts on the quartet distance  
Genome wide congealing and the dynamics of speciation  Our current understanding of speciation is still largely based on theory for small to moderate numbers of genes  We describe a possible emergent genome process involving the aggregate effect of large numbers of genes contributing to the evolution of reproductive isolation across the speciation continuum   When a threshold number of divergently selected mutations of modest to low fitness effect accumulate between populations diverging with gene flow  nonlinear transitions can occur in which levels of adaptive differentiation  linkage disequilibrium  and reproductive isolation dramatically increase  In effect  the genomes of the populations start to   congeal   into distinct entities representing different species  At this stage  reproductive isolation changes from being a characteristic of specific genes to a property of the genome  We examine conditions conducive to genome wide congealing  GWC  and how to empirically test for GWC with some putative empirical examples  We conclude with cautious optimism that models and concepts discussed here may provide a framework for integrating information from genome scans  selection experiments  QTL mapping  association studies and natural history to develop a deeper understanding of the genomics of speciation  
Factors promoting coexistence in a sexual asexual minnow complex  The Northern Redbelly Dace  Phoxinus eos  and the Finescale Dace  P   neogaeus  form an all female  asexual hybrid  P  eos neogaeus    The hybrid produces diploid ova that initiate development upon contact with sperm from males of one of the parental species  in this case  P  eos    The sperm genome is discarded  however  producing clones of the maternal hybrid  gynogenesis    Because all resulting hybrid offspring are females  the hybrid population can grow twice as quickly as the sexual population  potentially resulting in local extinction of the sexuals and therefore extinction in the hybrid population itself for lack of a sperm source   However  in this system  gynogenesis is not perfect  occasionally sperm fertilize the diploid  hybrid ova producing triploid females   These females contain two copies of the P  eos genome  and one copy of the P  neogaeus genome   Triploids reproduce by discarding the P  neogaeus genome and producing haploid ova containing only P  eos nuclear DNA that are then fertilized resulting in male and female nuclear P  eos   In other words  the asexual lineage continually produces occasional males that can serve as a sperm source    These apparently  pure  nuclear P  eos can be identified by molecular techniques because they carry mitochondrial DNA from P  neogaeus  the original hybridization event involved a female P  neogaeus     This research examines three hypotheses for the maintenance of the sexual asexual complex including  male discrimination against hybrid females  fecundity differences between sexual and asexual females  and production of nuclear male sexuals from the asexual lineage                   Results suggest that male P  eos do not discriminate against asexual females  and both sexual and asexual females have similar fecundities   Computer simulations of population growth indicate that sexual populations of P  eos are quickly replaced by asexuals   Further  that the males necessary for maintenance of the asexual lineage are produced by the triploids  resulting in a population of apparent  pure  P  eos that all carry P  neogaeus mtDNA   Molecular work with fish collected in Montana support the modeling results  all male P  eos were found to have P  neogaeus mtDNA    
Measuring pollinator mediated selection with various fitness components  A review and a lesson from Linum pubescens  Pollinator mediated selection has been postulated to drive floral trait evolution  Animal pollinators react to floral trait value differentially  This shapes the fitness function and provides inference of pollinator mediated selection in floral evolution  Fitness can be measured in various ways  and a review in 2003  Geber   Griffen  2003  tabulated the various ways of measuring fitness in selection studies in plants  Since this decade old review  many studies accumulated  and here we focus on studies that measured pollinator mediated selection  We ask the following question  1  Are fitness components measured as diverse as before 2003  2  Is the fitness component chosen affects the extent of selection  And 3  is there interaction between the extent of pollinator mediated selection and the fitness component chosen  To assess the effect of various fitness components on inferring pollinator mediated selection we measured four fitness components in the annual distylous plant Linum pubescens  and estimated selection on floral size and color  and on style morph  Three fitness components  number of fruits  number of seeds and their mass  were highly correlated  while the fourth component  fruit set  had lower correlation to the other three  While floral color and style morph did not show selection  regardless the fitness component used  floral size was under positive linear selection using number of fruits  number of seeds and seeds mass  We discuss these results as related to the possible mechanism that create selection through pollinator behavior   
When mito nuclear epistasis looks like genomic and sexual conflict  We show how a gene s eye view of simple mito nuclear epistasis can give the appearance of mother s curse acting on the mitochondrial genome or of intra locus sexual conflict acting on the nuclear genome  We also show how either single gene view misses important aspects of the inter genomic co evolutionary dynamic  including the potential for run away co evolution  the influence of inbreeding on mitochondrial evolution  and the potential for transient mito nuclear disequilibria  We suggest that  in some instances  the perception of genetic conflict may be an  evolutionary spandrel   an adaptive single gene interpretation of an essentially multi locus adaptive process    
Investigation of salt tolerance in an association mapping population of cultivated sunflower  Helianthus annuus L    Domestication of wild plants by human selection has played a significant role in artificially changing plant traits for large scale cultivation  Because crop species have undergone tremendous selective pressures to refine plant architecture and maximize yield  it is theorized that cultivated varieties often show a loss of tolerance to withstand biotic and abiotic environmental stresses as a necessary trade off to achieve increased growth  In this study  we used an association mapping population of cultivated sunflower  Helianthus annuus L   to assess variation in growth  resource allocation  and yield while grown under salt stressed conditions  Salinity is a pervasive concern in agricultural fields  particularly in areas dependent on irrigation  Cultivated sunflower is an important worldwide seed oil crop  and its ability to tolerate saline conditions is not yet well characterized  We addressed the following questions   1  How much variation exists in salt tolerance among different genetic lines of Helianthus annuus   2  Does an increased tolerance to salt stress necessarily correlate with reduced growth   3   To answer these questions  we grew H  annuus in a common garden greenhouse under constant salt stress and measured whole plant growth and biomass allocation  Plants exhibited a wide range of values in regards to biomass allocation and growth under salt stress  and did not show consistent signs of reduced growth with increased salt tolerance  These results are consistent with the theory that salt tolerance is a highly quantitative trait  with multiple QTL potentially interacting to generate a whole plant  tolerant  phenotype  In addition  this study presents a unique opportunity to screen a large amount of genetic diversity across the sunflower germplasm and characterize cultivated sunflower s ability to tolerate salt stress  This knowledge may help inform growers to select and focus on growing putatively salt tolerant sunflower lines in fields where high salinity levels may be present  
Comparative methods for evaluating the evolutionary history of function valued traits  a case study of salt tolerance in wild Helianthus  sunflowers   Phylogenetic comparative methods such as ancestral state reconstruction provide methods for testing hypotheses of trait evolution  while methods such as phylogenetically independent contrasts  PICs  and phylogenetic generalized least squares  PGLS  allow for tests of correlated trait evolution  Although intraspecific differences due to measurement error  sampling error  or natural variation can be incorporated into error structures  these models generally operate under the assumption that individual species possess a fixed mean for any given trait  These assumptions are violated when environmentally induced plasticity generates large trait shifts within species  which may result in the observation of substantial intraspecific variation  However  uniform environments fail to capture the full extent of trait combinations possible within a species  instead  only a snapshot of possible trait combinations is identified  which is potentially problematic when making evolutionary inferences on putatively adaptively plastic traits  Categorical environmental manipulations  such as   low   and   high   treatments  offer an improved range of intraspecific trait plasticity  but problems are likely to arise if the slope  strength  or shape of reaction norms or plastically induced shifts in correlated traits differs across species  Application of continuous environmental gradients to all species of interest offers the opportunity to more fully assess the relationship between environment and plastically varying traits and shifts in correlated traits within species  and how the nature of such relationships vary across species  However  methods for analyzing function valued traits in a phylogenetic context are few  providing little motivation for researchers to conduct studies of the magnitude that would produce the large amount of data necessary to make such inferences  Here  these issues are explored using wild 34 wild Helianthus species exposed to a gradient of 9 different salt treatments  from 0 to 400 mM NaCl   Helianthus species are native to very diverse habitats across North America  including serpentine soils  salt marshes  shifting sand dunes  prairies  flood plains  and coastal soils  The evolutionary history of salt tolerance and correlated functional trait evolution in Helianthus is assessed using both traditional phylogenetic comparative methods and recently developed methods for evaluating function valued evolutionary processes  and the strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed  
An integrated phylogenomic approach toward pinpointing the origin of mitochondria  Overwhelming evidence supports the endosymbiosis theory that mitochondria originated once from the a proteobacteria  However  its exact position in the tree of life remains highly debated  This is because systematic noise including sparse taxonomic sampling  sequence composition biases and high evolutionary rates has long plagued the mitochondrial phylogenetics  In this study  we address this issue by 1  increasing the taxonomic representation of a proteobacterial genomes by sequencing 18 phylogenetically novel species  They include 5 Rickettsiales and 4 Rhodospirillales  two orders that have shown close affiliations with mitochondria previously  2  using a set of 29 slowly evolving mitochondria derived nuclear genes that are less biased than mitochondria encoded genes as the alternative  well behaved  phylogenetic markers  3  applying site heterogeneous mixture models that account for the sequence composition bias  With the integrated phylogenomic approach  we are able to for the first time place mitochondria unequivocally within the Rickettsiales order  as a sister clade to the Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families  all subtended by the Holosporaceae family  Our results suggest that mitochondria most likely originated as an endosymbiont in the Rickettsiales lineage  but not from the distantly related free living Pelagibacter and Rhodospirillales  In addition  the multiple diverse Holosporaceae genomes sequenced in this project will provide novel insights into the genetic complement of mitochondrial ancestor  
Why tropical species have narrow ranges and niches  a theoretical exploration of Janzens hypothesis  Janzen s hypothesis of  why mountain passes are higher in the tropics  has led to the idea that tropical species may be evolutionarily adapted to a narrower range of temperatures due to the limited seasonal temperature variation in the tropics and may then inhabit narrower elevational ranges   These conditions are hypothesized to promote parapatric speciation along elevational gradients as well as faster rates of climatic niche evolution   Numerous empirical studies have documented latitudinal patterns in species elevational ranges  temperature tolerances  and species richness that are consistent with Janzen s hypothesis  but conflicting patterns have also been found  This study presents the first mathematical model to examine the population level processes that lead to Janzen s hypothesis on the physiological responses of individual thermal tolerance to seasonal temperature variation  and how these responses lead to narrower species elevational ranges and higher speciation rate  
Phylogeny and biogeography of the spiny ant genus Polyrhachis  Hymenoptera  Formicidae   In terrestrial ecosystems  ants are one of the most widespread and dominant arthropod groups  Polyrhachis  spiny ants  is a very species rich genus which is widely distributed with more than 700 species over most of the Old World tropics  Based on seven nuclear and mitochondrial genes  we reconstruct the phylogeny of these ants and explain their current geographic distribution  We discuss whether their evolution started in South East Asia or Australia  
Multi trait divergence driven by predation environment causes immigrant inviability in Brachyrhaphis fishes  Natural selection often results in profound differences among populations from divergent selective environments  Predation is a well studied driver of divergence  with predators having a strong effect on the evolution of prey body shape and behavior  especially for traits related to predator escape   Comparative studies  both at the population level and between species  show that the presence or absence of predators can alter these phenotypic traits  Although this pattern is well documented in various species or population pairs  few studies have tested for the resulting effects on fitness  Here  I examine divergence in morphology  behavior  performance  burst speed and endurance swimming ability   and fitness  survival in the presence of a predator  associated with predation environment in sister species of the livebearing fish genus Brachyrhaphis that occur in divergent predation environments  predator present  B  roseni  predator absent  B  terrabensis   First  I found compelling evidence that personality traits diverge species from different predation environments such that populations that experience predation are more bold  active  and prone to explore than those that do not experience predation  Second  I found significant differences in body shape between predation environments  consistent with the hypothesis that locomotor function is optimized for either steady swimming  predator absent  or escape behavior  predator present   Third  body shape is highly correlated with swimming ability  with fish exhibiting more high predation like body shapes also having faster burst speed swimming responses  Likewise  endurance swimming ability significantly differed between species  with B  terrabensis outperforming B  roseni nearly ten told  suggesting a strong trade off between burst speed and endurance swimming ability  This likely results in strong selection against habitat switching  Finally  using a predator mesocosm experiment and path analysis I demonstrate that burst speed swimming ability strongly predicted survival in the presence of a predator  providing strong evidence for predator driven immigrant inviability in this group  I discuss the implications of the observed predator driven divergence on speciation within this group  
Genomic response to 30 years of selection for increased lifespan reveals increased immunity as correlated trait  Evolutionary theory posits that aging evolves by mutation accumulation and or antagonistic pleiotropy  However  to date  the precise identity of the genes and molecular polymorphisms that underlie the evolution of aging and longevity remains poorly understood  Here  we have analyzed the genomic basis of the evolution of longevity in Drosophila melanogaster by applying whole genome next generation resequencing to a set of longevity selection and control lines initiated by Leo Luckinbill and Bob Arking about 30 years ago  Using population genetic and statistical tools  we have identified candidate genes whose patterns of differentiation have most likely been shaped by selection  Interestingly  among the candidates  we found strong evidence for a functional enrichment of immunity genes  particularly those involved in the defense response to fungi  To test whether this pattern is functionally relevant and real  we measured survival of selected and control flies upon pathogenic challenge with the fungus B  bassiana  the gram positive bacterium E  faecalis  and the gram negative bacterium E  carotovora  We found that long lived lines are indeed significantly more resistant to all three pathogenic infections than controls  As predicted  the age dependent decline in survival upon infection with B  bassiana and E  faecalis was much steeper in control flies than in long lived selected flies  Moreover  RT qPCR results further indicated that selection and control lines differ in their age dependent expression for several immunity genes  including antimicrobial peptides  again confirming functional differentiation between selection and control lines for immunity  Our results thus establish a causal link between the evolution of longevity and improved immune function at old age  
 Endogenous hepdnaviruses  bornaviruses and circoviruses in snakes   Endogenous viruses from three major viral groups  hepdnaviruses  bornaviruses and circoviruses  have been identified in the genome of the speckled rattlesnake  Crotalus mitchellii  the first viperid for which such data are available  Analysis of the draft genome assembly reveals fragments from these three viral families have been inserted into the genome of this snake over the past 50 million years  We characterized sequences from each virus bioinformatically and validated their presence using PCR   Analysis of other whole genome sequences and PCR screens of other species were also used to determine the presence absence of these endogenous viral elements  EVEs  in other lineages of snakes  Based on these data and known divergence times among snake species  we are able to estimate the date of endogenization events for each EVE  Circoviruses appear to have integrated most recently  within the last  10 my   whereas bornaviruses and hepadnaviruses integrated much earlier   30 and  60 mya  respectively   We discuss the relationships of the endogenous viruses in snakes relative to endogenous viruses from other metazoans  as well as to their closest known exogenous relatives  Given the paucity of studies on endogenous viruses in vertebrates  despite the plethora of whole genome sequence data now available  our study provides new and valuable insight into the process and timing of viral endogenization  indicating that it has occurred on both recent and more ancient evolutionary timescales  This is  to our knowledge  the first report of endogenized viruses in non avian reptiles and provides a window into the evolutionary dynamics of viruses in these host lineages  
Why is Madagascar special  Diversification patterns in pelican spiders  Archaeidae   Madagascar is known for having high species richness and endemism  Archaeid spiders are an ancient group with unusual morphologies and predatory behaviors that likely have been on Madagascar since Pangaean times  We examine whether Madagascan archaeids are undergoing adaptive radiation compared to lineages in the only other areas where extant species exist  Australia and South Africa  We also examine the distribution patterns of Madagascan archaeids to examine the relationship between distribution and adaptive divergence  Using a time calibrated phylogeny we find that there are increased rates of habitat and trait diversification in the Madagascar archaeids  and that there is a significant correlation between habitat and morphology  suggestive of an adaptive radiation  We also find that montane areas  as well as rainforest refugia and the evolution of different ecogeographic regions are important for species accumulation  however  this diversification is due to more ancient climate events than the Pleistocene glacial cycles  Possibly Madagascar has had more ancient climatic events compared to other areas where archaeids occur and have not radiated  and that these events allowed for cycles of forest contraction and expansion  allowing for greater rates of diversification  
Sexual selection and the evolution of the Major Histocompatibility Complex  The Major Histocompatibility Complex  MHC  is an essential component of the vertebrate adaptive immune system  responsible for the recognition and presentation of foreign antigens  The genes of the MHC are exceptionally polymorphic  a condition thought to be mediated by a combination of pathogen mediated selection and disassortative mating preferences  Recent simulation results indicate that natural and sexual selection may interact in a non additive fashion  generating levels of MHC variation in excess of those expected under either process in isolation  and highlighting the potential importance of sexual selection in the maintenance of ecologically relevant genetic variation  Sex role reversed species  in which the conventional patterns of male competition and female choice are inverted  offer a potential opportunity to experimentally partition the forces of natural and sexual selection and to better understand their involvement in the generation and maintenance of genetic diversity  I will describe the recent characterization of the genes of the Major Histocompatibility II loci in the sex role reversed seahorse  Hippocampus abdominalis  with the aid of next generation sequencing technologies  and detail a series of behavioral experiments aimed at clarifying the role of sexual selection in generating MHC diversity in this species  The results of these experiments are counterintuitive  and may help to shed light on how genetic variation for ecologically relevant traits can be maintained in the face of strong directional selection  
Adaptation and Mullers ratchet in sympatric populations of sexual and apomictic Boechera spatifolia  Brassicaceae   Asexuality holds several advantages over sexual reproduction  including increased genetic contributions to subsequent generations and reduced resource investment in reproduction  Despite this  2 fold  advantage  obligately asexual lineages are rare among multi cellular organisms   Muller s Ratchet   the sequential and irreversible fixation of deleterious mutations in asexual populations  is one explanation for the overwhelming prevalence of sexual reproduction in animals and vascular plants  Here  we use the atlas of non coding genomic sequences that are conserved across the Brassicaceae plant family to characterize the extent and nature of mutations in seven sympatric pairs of sexual and apomictic  asexual  genotypes of Boechera spatifolia  In each of the seven comparisons  the ratio of mutations at conserved to neutral sites is significantly elevated in apomictic lineages relative to sexuals  Additionally  apomictic populations show signatures of reduced adaptation to local conditions across the landscape  These data provide evidence  that asexual lineages harbor an increased level of mutations at sites under positive selection  and invoke Muller s Ratchet as a powerful force in the evolution of asexual lineages  
Ecological controls of mammalian diversification  Mammalian diversity is generated by the process of evolutionary diversification  or amidst the pull of speciation and extinction  To study these dynamics  we combine several tools of modern diversification analysis and apply them to a state of the art phylogeny of mammals  We find that mammalian diversification is remarkably directional  transitioning from unbounded clade expansion to diversification slowdowns and  eventually  equilibrium diversity  Each of these phases is controlled by different ecological processes  The most universal role plays species co occurrence which induces steep diversification slowdowns  suggesting that competition might constrain clade expansion  We also find that clades of warm  humid  and productive climates saturate faster  which perhaps results in finer ecospace subdivision in the tropics  Our study is the first to show how diversification dynamics change with phylogenetic scale  It also lends support to the hypothesis of ecological limits on clade diversification and illustrates how these limits presumably operate  
Does dispersal ability affect the spatial organization of geographic ranges   Speciation patterns  habitat selection  and inheritance of range features all contribute to how closely related species are organized in space  Another biological trait  dispersal ability  is indeed important to individuals but its effect on large scale patterns of biodiversity is contentious  We examined how dispersal ability correlated with range clustering in insect and vertebrate taxa of the Guiana Shield  The Guiana Shield is a region where large waterways have been shown to be important boundaries for animal dispersal  but the degree to which these boundaries are effective at determining animal distributions should vary by a taxons ability to disperse across it  Therefore  we predicted that  among closely related species  weakly dispersing taxa will show spatially clustered distributions more often than in strongly dispersing taxa  We tested this by comparing actual distributions to random Poisson distributions and comparing aggregate results  Our two major findings are that   1  levels of spatial clustering vary significantly among taxa with different dispersal paradigms  and  2  dispersal ability does not correlate with differences in spatial clustering of taxa  Given these findings  we believe that organismal specific traits  e g  niche  evolutionary history  are more important in determining these patterns because of a disparity in relavent temporal scales and an inability to standardize definitions of dispersal ability  
The Effect of Sampling Bias on the Heritability of Preference and the Strength of  Sexual Selection  The evolution of mate choice is a function of the heritability of preference   Estimation in the laboratory is typically made by presenting a female with a limited number of males   We use an individual based simulation model to demonstrate that such an approach produces a downwardly biased estimate of preference  which we term the heritability of choice   The threshold transformation method is shown to produce a less biased estimate particularly for preferences based on the relative value of the preferred trait   Because females in the wild typically survey less than 5 males before mating  we argue that the heritability of choice may be more meaningful than the heritability of preference   The effect of the restricted sampling of males on the strength of sexual selection depends upon both the number sampled and preference function    These results are discussed with reference to the Lek paradox and the common occurrence of multiple matings and extra pair copulations  
Local Adaptation Drives Intraspecific Reproductive Isolation in Iris atropurpurea  Ecological speciation is a process in which local adaptation causes diverging selective pressure that consequently creates reproductive isolation  RI  between populations  RI can also arise between geographically distant populations due to stochastic processes  The two processes are not mutually exclusive and can cause outbreeding depression in crossings from different populations  representing the forming process of incipient speciation  Theory suggests that due to combined effect of inbreeding and outbreeding depression  RI will be the lowest in an intermediate distance between crossed populations  However  this was tested only for geographical  and not for ecological  distance   In this study  we tested the role of geographical and ecological distances in creating reproductive isolation between populations of Iris atropurpurea  an endangered plant endemic to Israeli coastal plain  We performed crosses between populations at different geographical and ecological distances and tested for association of geographical and ecological distances with fruit set  seed number and seed viability  We tested the effect of these distances on RI  which was calculated using the relative reproductive success of crosses between populations  compared to crosses within population  RI calculated based on fruit set was positively influenced by both geographical and ecological distances  but RI estimations based on seed number and viability were not  Total RI did not show an intermediate geographical distance of low RI  as expected  instead  a maximum RI was observed in this distance  Total RI increased with ecological distance  and the combined effect of ecology and geography on RI was overall a non linear increase with increase of both distances  Individual edaphic and climatic factors were correlated with RI  suggesting specific role in local adaptation  Overall  our findings suggest that RI between populations of Iris atropurpurea is driven by local adaptation  rather than by isolation by distance  These results are relevant for both understanding ecological speciation and creating conservation programs of genetic rescue for endangered species 
 Female color preferences  ecological selection  and the evolution of male nuptial coloration in darters  Percidae  Etheostomatinae    The interplay of natural  ecological  and sexual selection in shaping biological diversity is increasingly recognized as a central question in evolutionary biology  and male sexual ornamentation is a primary focus  Theory predicts sexual selection will lead to the elaboration of an ornament if there is an associated increase in mating success  However  ecological factors should inhibit ornamentation when there is a reduction in survival  We examined sexual and ecological selection on male ornamentation in darters  family Percidae   a diverse group of freshwater fishes that vary in the presence of male nuptial coloration from achromatic  black  to elaborate chromatic signals  Our objectives were to determine 1  if female color preferences  one component of sexual selection  are predictably associated with male nuptial color and 2  whether differences in ecological selection pressures predict the presence of male nuptial coloration  Female darters were presented with a series of motorized models to simulate courting males colored red  blue  black  or grey  and association preferences with these different stimuli were measured  Across several species  females exhibited significant preferences for particular colors  and preferred colors varied across species  Phylogenetic comparative analyses also indicate that the presence of male nuptial coloration  specifically red and orange  is significantly associated with environments that would support fewer predators  A laboratory study of color preferences in a common darter predator  largemouth bass  Micropterus salmoides   indicates a strong preference for red prey items  providing additional evidence that predation may contribute to variation in darter coloration  Results from behavioral and comparative analyses are discussed in light of sexual and ecological selection on male ornamentation to elucidate factors that shape color variation in darters  
Why wait  The optimal waiting time between an environmental cue and a plastic response  An adaptive plastic response to an environmental cue results in an organism developing a phenotype that is in some way appropriate to the future conditions forecast by the cue  Clearly  the more accurate the forecast the more likely it is that the response will be appropriate  although plasticity is favoured by selection for surprisingly inaccurate cues  and the higher the expected fitness benefit to organisms employing such a cue  Selection  then  may be expected to favour the evolution of accurate cues  Everything else being equal  cues that induce an immediate developmental response might be expected to be more accurate than cues that occur some time before the response is initiated because there is less opportunity for unexpected environmental changes and the correlation between the cue and the future environment will be higher  Nevertheless  many plastic responses  so called  predictive adaptive responses   are induced by cues that occur long before any developmental changes occur  In this talk  I will explore the reasons why it it may be better to wait  These results can be used to predict what sorts of traits may be influenced by predictive adaptive responses  
Comparative Genomics and Transcriptomics of the New Zealand Giant Weta  Giant Weta are among the largest extant insects on earth  and are an iconic part of the New Zealand biota  However  a number of these species are highly endangered  The Poor Knights Giant Weta  Deinacrida fallai  Orthoptera  is one such species  and is restricted to a small offshore island  Despite widespread interest in this and related species  the current genomic resources are lacking  Our aim is to construct a comparative genomic dataset that will be used to investigate various aspects of molecular evolution and evolutionary relationships of this endemic New Zealand insect   Its genome is large  current estimates indicate that the genome is approximately 10 GB in size  which is larger than the only published Orthopteran genome  that of Locusta migratoria  Our current draft assembly for Weta has been obtained from a mixture of paired end and mate pair libraries  In addition  a de novo transcriptome has been generated for this species from five different tissues using Trinity  The resulting unigenes are being used to identify transcripts of interest  including male reproductive proteins  glycolytic genes and odorant receptors  in order to study rates and patterns of evolution among species  RNA seq data has also been generated for a number of Tree and other Giant Weta species  resulting in an average number of 128 912 contigs per species  and an average N50 of 1kb  The current data sets will be combined with Genotyping By Sequencing data to investigate various conservation genetics issues  in order to better inform current and future conservation efforts  
Male beneficial genotypes harbor deleterious genetic architecture  When constructing inbred lines  the majority of lineages one attempts to inbreed typically go extinct prior to achieving the desired inbreeding coefficient  The two most widely accepted mechanisms of extinction due to inbreeding are increased homozygosity for partially recessive deleterious mutations  the partial dominance hypothesis  and increased homozygosity for alleles at loci with heterozygote advantage  the overdominance hypothesis   Starting with a population of 41 isofemale lines genotypes of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus showing sexually antagonistic  SA  genetic variation  20 replicate lineages of each isofemale line were subject to single pair full sib inbreeding for 10 consecutive generations  Approximately 80  of these lineages had gone extinct by the end of 10 generations of inbreeding  Survival analyses revealed that the pattern of extinction was variable across the different isofemale lines and was non linear  i e  attributable to inbreeding per se and not simply cumulative stochastic extinction   A mixed effects Cox regression revealed that male beneficial genotypes suffered relatively greater extinction rates than female beneficial genotypes  Likewise  multiple regression revealed that replicate lineages from male beneficial genotypes were significantly more likely to be extinct after 10 generations of inbreeding relative to those from female beneficial genotypes  Insights as to the mechanism s  responsible for this observation are provided by causal details of lineage extinctions recorded throughout the experiment  as well as a follow up experiment comparing female fecundity and male fertility in extant lineages from genotypes at opposite extremes of the continuum from male beneficial low survival to female beneficial high survival  Explanations for these results are discussed in the context of the partial dominance and the overdominance hypotheses described above  These results provide insights into the nature of SA genetic architecture  but also suggest that certain components of genetic variation are likely underrepresented or even completely lacking from panels of inbred lines  
A role for male behavior in trait divergence and behavioral isolation in darters  Some of the most striking examples of biodiversity occur in groups with elaborate sexual signals and displays  Divergence in male sexual signals between allopatric populations is often considered a result of changing female preferences  driven by genetic drift or environmental differences  By comparison  male competitive interactions and preferences receive little attention as potential drivers of speciation among allopatric populations  By simulating secondary contact in the lab  we show that male competitive responses and color displays have coevolved in allopatric species of freshwater fish  as male color differences between species increase  interspecific aggression decreases  Male signal divergence also precedes divergence in competitive responses  a pattern consistent with mutation order speciation  Measures of behavioral isolation do not correlate with color divergence but do correlate with male courting biases  These results highlight an important role for male competition and choice in trait divergence and the evolution of behavioral isolation in a diverse genus of fishes  
Genome wide relationships among color pattern forms in a widespread polymorphic bumble bee  Bombus bifarius exhibits dramatic divergence in pile coloration throughout its geographic range in the western United States  Populations in the easternmost parts of the species range  Colorado and southern Wyoming  exhibit a striking red hair color on the second and third abdominal segments  red banded   while those in the westernmost parts have black colored pile  black banded   Geographically intermediate populations  e g   Wyoming and Utah  are more variable  sometimes appearing similar to one of the two extremes  but usually with some degree of mixed orange and black coloration  Previous analyses of population structure in B  bifarius using microsatellites have suggested some patterns of genetic structure consistent with both phenotypic and regional geographic differentiation  but the high variability and large population sizes in bumble bees has made distinguishing isolation from ongoing gene flow challenging  Here we apply two methods  total RNA sequencing and double digest RAD tag sequencing  to analyze genome wide nucleotide variation across a geographic and color pattern transect in B  bifarius from Colorado to Oregon  We apply several approaches to test the strength of evolutionary isolation and relationships among these populations  and also to examine individual SNPs for unique patterns of shared similarity between red banded and mixed populations in an intial effort to identify genome regions that may play a role in coloration  
Residency time as an indicator of reproductive restraint in male burying beetles  The cost of reproduction theory posits that there are trade offs between current and future reproduction because resources that are allocated to current offspring cannot be used for future reproductive opportunities   Two adaptive reproductive strategies have been hypothesized to reduce the costs of reproduction and maximize lifetime fitness   The terminal investment hypothesis predicts that as individuals age they will allocate more resources to current reproduction as a response to decreasing residual reproductive value   The reproductive restraint hypotheses predicts that as individuals age they will allocate fewer resources to current reproduction to increase the chance of securing an additional reproductive opportunity   In this study  we test for adaptive responses to aging in male burying beetles  Nicrophorus orbicollis   Burying beetles use facultative biparental care  but the male typically abandons the brood before the female   Previous work in male burying beetles has suggested several factors to explain variation in male residency time  but no study has observed male behavior throughout their entire reproductive lifetimes to determine whether males change residency time in an adaptive way with age   We compared residency time of males that reproduced biparentally  uniparentally  and on different sized carcasses   Males did not increase residency time in response to advanced partner age when reproducing biparentally  but decreased residency time with age when reproducing uniparentally   A decrease in parental care with age is consistent with a reproductive restraint strategy   To our knowledge  this is the first test of adaptive reproductive strategies in male burying beetles and is one of the first studies to demonstrate reproductive restraint in males   
Description of a Novel Genetic Marker for Species Identification of Freshwater Mussel Larvae Recovered from Naturally Infested Fish Hosts  Freshwater mussels in North America are species rich and vastly diverse in morphology and habitat use  Because of this diversity  the ecosystem functions mussels provide  e g   water filtration  nutrient cycling  are likely to occur across freshwater systems  Due to habitat destruction  many mussel populations are in decline  In order to maintain current populations  larvae must successfully recruit to replenish populations as well as establish new populations  Because mussels have an obligate parasitic larval stage  recruitment is dependent on host availability  Some mussel species have adapted methods of attracting fish hosts with lures and host use is best understood for these taxa  Conversely  there is little known about host use in mussel taxa that lack conspicuous lures  Recently  genetic data have provided insights into host use in mussel taxa that lack lures because genetic markers can be used to identify mussel larvae on fish hosts in nature  Unfortunately  the genetic markers used in these studies are found in both mussel and host and the risk of contamination from host tissue is high  An ideal genetic marker would be unique to mussel genomes yet capable of distinguishing between mussel species  Here  we show that Female specific Open Reading Frame  FORF  is an ideal genetic marker for mussel species identification and host use determination  The FORF database presented here is specific to mussel taxa in the Apalachicola River Basin  ACF   but could easily be extended to include other river drainages  Representatives of all extant mussel taxa were collected from the ACF and  using tissue samples  a FORF genetic barcode database was generated  Using mussel larvae recovered from naturally infested host fish  FORF was able to identify the mussel species  Additionally  fish host use for these mussel species was determined  To our knowledge  this study is the first to document host use in two species of the genus Elliptio  E  fraterna and E  fumata   The implication for the use of this genetic marker is simple species identification of mussel larvae collected from host tissue without host contamination   
Evolution of elemental composition in E  coli under carbon and nitrogen limitation  At the broadest level  organisms can be viewed as a collection of chemical elements in various ratios  These ratios vary between organisms  While this variation in elemental composition is known to have important ecological consequences  little is known about how it changes over evolutionary time  In previous work  we demonstrated that E  coli evolved higher nitrogen and phosphorus content and increased carbon use efficiency after 50 000 generations of evolution under carbon limited  high nitrogen and phosphorus conditions  However  this experiment did not differentiate between adaptation to carbon limitation and adaptation to other experimental conditions such as growth in batch culture and in a well mixed environment  To isolate the effect of nutrient limitation  we further evolved clones from the original 50 000 generation experiment under either carbon limited or nitrogen limited conditions for 1 000 generations  We will present results on the changes in fitness  carbon consumption  and carbon  nitrogen and phosphorus content of the bacteria over the course of this experiment and discuss implications for understanding evolutionary changes in elemental ratios  
Sex specific effects of brain size on survival under semi natural conditions in the guppy  Poecilia reticulata   Large brains are costly to produce and maintain but are believed to confer fitness benefits in challenging environments by facilitating the construction of adequate behavioural responses  While results from comparative analyses suggest positive relationships between relative brain size and facets of fitness  experimental evidence is lacking  Here we test how relative brain size affects survival  one critical aspect of fitness  We mixed selection lines of marked large  and small brained guppies  Poecilia reticulata  400 large brained and 400 small brained fish with 50 50 sex ratio per replicate  in six large semi natural ponds together with their natural predator  the pike cichlid  Crenicichla alta   We then monitored survival in weekly censuses until 50   of the original population size remained  We found that large brained females survived better under predation pressure compared to small brained females  In males  brain size did not affect survival  We explain our survival results by a cognitive advantage in large brained animals  which allows them to better evade predation  and we suggest that the greater colourfulness  which exists in large brained males  may have counteracted this effect in males  We thereby provide the first experimental evidence that a large brain can confer survival benefits in naturalistic conditions and propose that such survival benefits constitute a major selective force on brain size in natural populations  
Life history evolution of serotinous trees  the role of inter fire recruitment and dispersal  Many plant species have evolved serotiny  i e  the retention of mature seeds in closed cones within the plant s canopy  as a means to deal with recurring fire events  We build on a recent model of serotiny evolution in fire prone environments and extend it to explore the role of metapopulation dynamics and recruitment between fires  In this respect we are to our knowledge the first to investigate the interplay between dispersal and serotiny  We have therefore developed an individual based metapopulation model of a serotinous tree species with several life history traits evolving  age of first reproduction  reproductive effort  degree of serotiny   When investigating the fire regime  we find that the age of first reproduction increases with increasing fire return interval  while reproductive effort decreases  Yet  our results show a unimodal response of the degree of serotiny to decreasing fire frequency  which can be explained by lowered benefits of being serotinous for very high or very low fire frequencies  We also find a positive relationship between the amount of seed dispersal and the optimal degree of serotiny  The reason for this can be found in the recruitment dynamics between fires  as more dispersal leads to a faster colonization of empty sites  thus increasing the benefit of producing seeds as early after a fire as possible  Inter fire dynamics of serotiny additionally reveal that  even though the average serotiny level has reached an equilibrium at the metapopulation level  within populations genotypes with strong serotiny are advantaged just after fire occurrence but there is selection for lower serotiny between fires  
Gynodioecy and sex ratio variation within a large network of natural populations  Gynodioecy is the co occurrence of females and hermaphrodites within the same plant species  It is often due to conflicting interactions between cytoplasmic genes of male sterility  CMS  which effect can be counteracted by nuclear genes that restore pollen production  The maintenance of such polymorphism has been shown to depend on patterns of frequency dependent selection within populations  but also on metapopulation dynamics  In this study  we have documented the variation of sex ratio  CMS and nuclear restorers frequency within 85 natural populations of gynodioecious  wind pollinated plant Beta vulgaris ssp  maritima  By analyzing the effects of population isolation  population size  level of disturbance and neutral genetic diversity on sex ratio variation  and by comparing our results to theoretical predictions  we investigate how selective vs  non selective processes affect the maintenance of females in populations  
Coupling Between Protein Level Selection and Codon Usage Optimization in the Evolution of Bacteria and Archaea    The relationship between the selection affecting codon usage and selection on protein sequences of orthologous genes in diverse groups of bacteria and archaea was examined by using the Alignable Tight Genome Clusters database of prokaryote genomes  The codon usage bias is generally low  with 57 5  of the gene specific optimal codon frequencies  Fopt  being below 0 55  This apparent weak selection on codon usage contrasts with the strong purifying selection on amino acid sequences  with 65 8  of the gene specific dN dS ratios being below 0 1  For most of the genomes compared  a limited but statistically significant negative correlation between Fopt and dN dS was observed  which is indicative of a link between selection on protein sequence and selection on codon usage  The strength of the coupling between the protein level selection and codon usage bias showed a strong positive correlation with the genomic GC content  Combined with previous observations on the selection for GC rich codons in bacteria and archaea with GC rich genomes  these findings suggest that selection for translational fine tuning could be an important factor in microbial evolution that drives the evolution of genome GC content away from mutational equilibrium  This type of selection is particularly pronounced in slowly evolving   high status  genes  A significantly stronger link between the two aspects of selection is observed in free living bacteria than in parasitic bacteria and in genes encoding metabolic enzymes and transporters than in informational genes  These differences might reflect the special importance of translational fine tuning for the adaptability of gene expression to environmental changes  The results of this work establish the coupling between protein level selection and selection for translational optimization as a distinct and potentially important factor in microbial evolution  IMPORTANCE Selection affects the evolution of microbial genomes at many levels  including both the structure of proteins and the regulation of their production  Here we demonstrate the coupling between the selection on protein sequences and the optimization of codon usage in a broad range of bacteria and archaea  The strength of this coupling varies over a wide range and strongly and positively correlates with the genomic GC content  The cause s  of the evolution of high GC content is a longstanding open question  given the universal mutational bias toward AT  We propose that optimization of codon usage could be one of the key factors that determine the evolution of GC rich genomes  This work establishes the coupling between selection at the level of protein sequence and at the level of codon choice optimization as a distinct aspect of genome evolution  
Genome Wide Convergence with Repeated Evolution in Drosophila melanogaster     High levels of diversified  sequence polymorphism across numerous sites genome wide in populations under strong purifying or adaptive directional selection  are expected under a hypothesis of balancing selection at multiple individual loci  Since February of 1980  our research laboratory has developed outbred  moderate Ne populations of fruit flies with 5 fold replication under various selection regimes for life history reproductive delay  vial and cage adaptation  and phenotypic assays of dietary and physiological characters  Each treatment has been maintained in stable environments for tens to hundreds of generations of various sustained selection conditions  These long term experiments form an elegant  parallel branch fly phylogeny  with known branching times  generation numbers  and well characterized population censes  Populational genomic re sequencing of representative lines of our phylogeny  has yielded surprising levels of genome wide polymorphism across multiple lines  with scarcely any evidence for classical genetic sweeps  These lab populations  the largest of their kind for multicellular model organisms  encounter stable environment  sustained selection unlike most natural populations  Yet  the lack of features expected under classic population genetic models suggest  1  that multi locus  perhaps gene network leveraged  balancing selection may be far more common than previously supposed  and  2  that there may be the need for new paradigmatic approaches to understanding genomic evolution in natural populations  
 The Diversification of Insects  a phylogenetic perspective   Hexapoda  insects and their relatives  is the most diverse terrestrial group of organisms on the planet and collectively comprise over half of all described species  Any attempt to understand the history of life on land and the assembly of terrestrial ecosystems is thus incomplete without consideration of the pattern of hexapod diversification and how the potential drivers of this richness have acted through evolutionary time  Previous work on understanding the history of hexapod diversification has either focused on patterns within the fossil record  which for hexapods is highly incomplete  or has been taxonomically restricted and so unable to consider the wider phylogenetic context   Here I present a first attempt to explore patterns of diversification within hexapods using an explicit dated phylogenetic hypothesis for the group and the application of birth death models  These models confirm the roles of flight and complete metamorphosis as key innovations driving hexapod diversification  Subsequent reductions in diversification are recovered for several relic groups previously identified as having a higher fossil diversity during the Mesozoic  In addition a number of recently derived taxa are found to have radiated at an elevated rate following the development of flowering plant  angiosperm  floras during the mid Cretaceous  Taken together these results identify key developmental innovations responsible for hexapod richness and differing responses of various hexapod groups to environmental changes from the mid Cretaceous floral transition to the present day  
The Impact of the Rate Prior on Bayesian Estimation of Divergence Times with Multiple Loci  Bayesian methods provide a powerful way to estimate species divergence times by combining information from molecular sequences with information from the fossil record  With the explosive increase of genomic data  divergence time estimation increasingly uses data of multiple loci  genes or site partitions   Widely used computer programs to estimate divergence times use independent and identically distributed  i i d   priors on the substitution rates for different loci  The i i d  prior is problematic  As the number of loci  L  increases  the prior variance of the average rate across all loci goes to zero at the rate 1 L  As a consequence  the rate prior dominates posterior time estimates when many loci are analysed  and if the rate prior is misspecified  the estimated divergence times will converge to wrong values with very narrow credibility intervals  Here we develop a new prior on the locus rates based on the Dirichlet distribution that corrects the problematic behaviour of the i i d  prior  We use computer simulation and real data analysis to highlight the differences between the old and new priors  For a dataset for six primate species  we show that with the old i i d  prior  if the prior rate is too high  or too low   the estimated divergence times are too young  or too old   outside the bounds imposed by the fossil calibrations  In contrast  with the new Dirichlet prior  posterior time estimates are insensitive to the rate prior and are compatible with the fossil calibrations  We re analysed a phylogenomic data set of 36 mammal species and show that using many fossil calibrations can alleviate the adverse impact of a misspecified rate prior to some extent  We recommend the use of the new Dirichlet prior in Bayesian divergence time estimation  
The grass tribe Paniceae  a model for C4 photosynthetic diversity and evolution  Most plants convert sunlight into chemical energy using C3 photosynthesis  However  a modified pathway  C4 photosynthesis  allows some plants to be more drought tolerant and fertilizer use efficient  Strikingly  C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently in dozens of different plant lineages  a testament to its diversity and advantages in many common terrestrial environments  Currently  massive international efforts are focused on breeding and bioengineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 rice and other food and sustainable energy crops   What these efforts often overlook is that there is no  one  C4 photosynthesis  In fact  with its 60 plus distinct evolutionary origins  20 plus anatomies  and 3 basic enzymatic sub types  C4 is more of a diverse syndrome than it is one generalized photosynthesis type  Because the various C4 sub types have evolved in diverse environments  different sub types may be more efficient for different agricultural applications   Our study uses the grass tribe Paniceae to investigate the evolution and diversity of C4 photosynthesis within a phylogenomic context  The Paniceae are ideal for this investigation because they are the only plant lineage with representatives that primarily utilize each of the C4 enzymatic subtypes  This allows us to answer questions such as  How are different types of C4 photosynthesis related to each other  Which C3 and C4 species are ideal model organisms for studying C4 evolution in the Paniceae  Which tribe Paniceae species are best suited for development as sustainable energy  food  health  and forage crops  
 Host Association Drives Deep Divergence in the Common Bed Bug  Cimex lectularius   The life histories of parasites are inextricably shaped by their hosts  creating a multitude of potential diversification mechanisms  One important mechanism is host associated differentiation  which depends on the level of host specificity and local adaptation  and may ultimately lead to host switching and speciation  Yet  there is a paucity of empirical studies on the speciation process of parasites  The bed bug  Cimex lectularius  represents a potential model organism for elucidating the processes involved in host mediated speciation of parasites  Bed bugs extended their host range from bats to humans when these two hosts shared cave domiciles in ancient times  Bed bugs that associate with humans have a cosmopolitan distribution  whereas those associated with bats appear common across much of Europe  We assessed genetic structure and gene flow within and among populations collected on each host using three classes of markers  mtDNA  nuclear microsatellite loci  and single nucleotide polymorphisms in knock down resistance genes  Both nuclear and mitochondrial data support a lack of significant contemporary gene flow amongst host specific populations  Limited diversity and elevated levels of inbreeding within locations suggest that human associated C  lectularius exist in a metapopulation framework  likely due to human mediated movement and frequent pest control  In contrast  populations within bat roosts exhibit higher diversity and lower levels of relatedness  suggesting populations are stable with temporal fluctuations due to host dispersal and bug mortality  Combined with previously reported behavioral data  these results suggest C  lectularius may be undergoing divergence through host association  
Warning signals are seductive  Relative contributions of color and pattern cues to predator avoidance and mate attraction in Heliconius butterflies  Visual signaling in animals can serve many uses  including predator deterrence and mate attraction  In many cases signals used to advertise unprofitability to predators are also used for intraspecific communication  Although aposematism  warning signaling  and mate choice are significant forces driving the evolution of many animal phenotypes  the interplay between relevant visual cues remains little explored  Here we address this question in the aposematic passion vine butterfly Heliconius erato by using color  and pattern manipulated models to test the contributions of different visual cues to both mate choice and warning coloration  We found that the relative effectiveness of a model at escaping predation was equivalent to its effectiveness at inducing mating behavior in males  and in both cases wing color cues were more predictive of fitness benefits than pattern cues  Overall  however  a combination of the appropriate color and pattern cues were most successful for both predator deterrence and mate attraction  By exploring the relative contributions of color versus pattern composition in predation and mate preference studies  we have shown how both natural and sexual selection can work in parallel to favor the evolution of specific animal color patterns   
Cenozoic mammals and the biology of extinction  Extinction is expected to be non random with respect to biology  Determining how different traits  both alone or in concert  influence extinction risk is extremely important for understanding the differential diversification of taxa  Traits relating to environmental preference are good candidates for modeling differential extinction because it is expected that  based purely on stochastic grounds  taxa which prefer rare environments would have a greater extinction risk than taxa which prefer abundant environments  Importantly  the Law of Constant Extinction posits that extinction risk is random with respect to taxon age  This statement has come increasingly under fire and its generality is possibly suspect  By fitting different theoretical distributions of survival to empirically observed durations  the generality of this statement can be tested  Trait mediated survival was studied at both the generic and specific level for the record of Cenozoic mammals using dietary and locomotor categories  as well as body size  These traits were selected because they relate directly to environmental preference  Preliminary analysis of specific level survival as predicted from dietary and locomotor categories indicated that North American and European mammals had fundamentally different patterns of taxon duration  North American species survival was best predicted by locomotor category while European species survival was best predicted by dietary category  Also  the distribution of North American species durations was best modeled as exponentially distributed  constant extinction risk  while European species durations were better modeled by a Weibull distribution  monotonic nonconstant extinction risk   Even with further refinements to this analysis  these results do highlight how regional level processes may shape taxonomic patterns in fundamentally different ways 
The mechanisms of frequency dependent selection in gynodioecious Lobelia siphilitica  Frequency dependent selection occurs when the fitness of an individual depends on its phenotype and on the frequency of that phenotype within the population   Negative frequency dependent selection is thought to be common in gynodioecious plants  where individuals are either female or hermaphroditic plants  if the fitness of female plants is limited by the availability of pollen to fertilize their ovules  then females should have higher fitness when they are rare relative to hermaphrodites   Although negative frequency dependent selection is often invoked to explain how females persist in gynodioecious species  it is rarely experimentally tested   To test whether females have higher fitness when rare  we manipulated the frequency of female and hermaphrodite plants within artificial populations of the gynodioecious wildflower  Lobelia siphilitica   We also hand pollinated half of the female plants in each population to test whether the mechanism of frequency dependent selection is variation in pollen availability   Females set 44  more fruits in populations where they were rare relative to hermaphrodites  as expected if frequency dependent selection contributes to the persistence of females in gynodioecious species   However  the relationship between fruit set and female frequency was the same for hand  and open pollinated plants  indicating that variation in pollen availability was not the mechanism of frequency dependent selection   Instead  both hand  and open pollinated females produced 33  more flowers in populations where they were rare  suggesting that changes in flower production can also be a mechanism of frequency dependent selection   This mechanism could explain how females persist in gynodioecious species even when reproduction is not limited by pollen availability  
In what types of environments is inbreeding depression strongest   Selection against inbred genotypes  i e  inbreeding depression  ID  is stronger in some environments than others   In what types of environments should we expect to find strong ID   Previous studies indicate that ID is positively correlated with the stressfulness of the environment in which it is measured   However  it remains unclear why stress  per se  should increase ID   To our knowledge  only competitive stress has a logical connection to the strength of ID   Using D  melangaster  we estimated ID for viability in 22 different environments   These environments were simultaneously characterized for  i  stressfulness  the reduction in absolute viability  and  ii  density dependence  as a measure of the sensitivity of fitness of individuals to those around it   Though stress and density dependence are moderately correlated with each other  ID is much more strongly correlated with density dependence   
Diversification and Speciation in the Ethiopian Highlands  Insights from a Radiation of Endemic Frogs  Ethiopia contains the most extensive continuous complex of mountainous habitats of Africa  The fauna and flora found in the Ethiopian highlands is unique and  for this reason  Ethiopia is considered one of the planet s biodiversity hotspots  The highest level of endemism is found in anurans  with 40  of the Ethiopian species being endemic to this country  The Ethiopian highlands are split in two uneven halves by the Great Rift Valley  Presently the valley floor is a very hot dry land and  as such  acts as a dispersal barrier for highland species  In spite of the general assumption that the Great Rift Valley has played a major role in shaping the biodiversity of the county  its impact on the evolutionary history of Ethiopian taxa it is not fully understood   We decided to examine the timing of anuran diversification in Ethiopia as well as the role geomorphological features  such as the Great Rift Valley  have played in the diversification of Ethiopian anurans  Frogs of the genus Ptychadena have experienced an evolutionary radiation in these highlands  Thus  this group provides an excellent opportunity to study the process of speciation in this important biogeographic area  Two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes were sequenced in more than 300 frogs collected across Ethiopia  Using a Bayesian species delimitation approach  we identified 8 genetically isolated populations which may represent separate cryptic species  We resolved the phylogeny of Ethiopian highland Ptychadena using a species tree approach and determined that species group on the phylogeny according to their habitat preference  We propose that the diversity of Ethiopian Ptychadena results from an early phase of specialization to distinct elevations followed by a phase of ecological diversification within each elevational range  We estimated that the early phase of diversification of Ethiopian Ptychadena probably occurred in the late Miocene and the most recent speciation events in the late Pliocene or Pleistocene  Our analysis suggests that the south eastern highlands and the tropical forests of the south west have acted as speciation centers  From these centers  some Ptychadena species have recently spread across the Great Rift Valley  resulting in trans Rift distributions  while others have remained limited to one side of the Valley  possibly because of their specialization to high elevations  
An inside out origin of the eukaryotic cell  All existing evolutionary models for the origin of the eukaryotic cell have assumed that the nucleus and endomembrane system arose within the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell   Here we challenge this paradigm by proposing that an ancestral prokaryote  equivalent to the modern day nucleus  constructed an external membranous compartment  homologous to the modern eukaryotic cytoplasm  Our model begins with the extrusion of stable membrane bound blebs that served to facilitate material exchange with ectosymbiotic proteobacteria that represent progenitors of mitochondria  Blebs were stabilized through the association of nuclear pore proteins within the bleb neck and attached to the outer cell wall by progenitors of LINC complexes  The space between adjacent blebs gave rise to the endoplasmic reticulum  ER   with subsequent bleb fusion events yielding a plasma membrane   Strikingly  this model explains previously enigmatic aspects of eukaryotic cell biology  including ER continuity  the close association between mitochondria and ER  the site of N glycosylation in the lumen of nuclear proximal ER  and the ability of nuclei in syncytia to control their local cytoplasm  Moreover  our model is consistent with recent phylogenetic analyses supporting  eocytes  as sister to Eukarya  and the presence of bacterial lipids in eukaryotes   Thus  the inside out model not only provides a new  more plausible explanation of eukaryotic evolution  but also provides a new predictive framework by which to better understand the dynamic organization of modern eukaryotic cells  
Inferring allele frequency trajectories of experimentally evolved Drosophila populations with Gaussian process models  Recent advances in sequencing technologies have provided a new experimental approach  evolve and resequence  E R   Using E R experiments we can investigate the dynamics of allele frequency changes at the molecular level in great detail  We can now monitor genome wide allele frequency  AF  trajectories at millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  for several replicate populations  The resulting time serial data enable us to identify candidate regions that are likely to evolve under selection  However  limited tools are available that can efficiently include all accessible information from the data  such as AF at intermediate time points  replicate experiments and sources of uncertainty coming from the sequencing   We address these problems by developing a beta binomial Gaussian process  BBGP  model for finding SNPs with significant frequency change over time that is consistent across replicates  codes are available at https   github com handetopa BBGP   The beta binomial model captures the uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and Gaussian processes provide a flexible way to model frequency trajectories of alleles  We show that for simulated data the GP based methods outperform frequently used pairwise statistical tests for finding selected alleles in average precision  Our results demonstrate that GP models are well suited for analyzing genomic time series data because they can effectively utilize the available information  making good use of additional time points and replicates   We present results from applying our approach on real data from Drosophila experimental evolution for temperature adaptation  Preliminary results suggest that the proposed method might be better suited to detect selection of small effect size or to model soft or incomplete sweeps    
Genome Wide Association Mapping to examine genetic basis of quantitative traits in natural populations An important goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how genetic variation is maintained in natural populations and for this we need to know the loci underlying fitness related traits and the selective forces operating on them  Advances in next generation sequencing has made it possible to carry out genome wide association mapping studies also on non model organisms and here we report on such efforts using data on two long term studies on birds   We used a 50k and a 10k custom made  SNP chip  in the collared flycatcher and house sparrow respectively to map the genetic basis of fitness related traits  I will discuss our findings and their implications for the genetic architecture of traits and the potential such GWAS efforts hold for mapping traits in other non model organisms 
 Analysis of variance in fitness over 50 000 generations in an evolution experiment   How repeatable the process of evolution is remains a central question within the field of experimental evolution   The Long Term Evolution Experiment  LTEE  is an ongoing experiment  in which 12 populations of Escherichia coli have been evolving separately for more than 50 000 generations   We have previously shown how fitness has changed within these populations over this time period   In this talk  we will discuss how the among population variance in fitness has changed  and what this can tell us about the underlying fitness landscape these populations have been experiencing   Empirical data will be compared tosimulations  allowing us to test whether our theoretical model captures the reality of the system  
Toxin gene expression variation in the eastern diamondback rattlesnake  Crotalus adamanteus    adaptive or neutral   Natural selection requires that individuals exhibit heritable phenotypic variation  and this variation must result in differential fitness  e g   survival and or reproduction  that enables the sorting of phenotypes in the next generation   Some snake venoms exhibit an extraordinary degree of variation both ontogenetically and geographically within species  presumably as a result of dietary differences  and positive selection on venom genes suggests a coevolutionary arms race may shape venom composition as a result of resistance development in prey   However  it has not been aptly demonstrated if these compositional differences are truly adaptive or a result of neutral processes  Previous work has examined the efficacy of different venom types in killing laboratory mice and while these measurements may correlate well with potential toxicity to humans  wild  sympatric prey are the ultimate repositories of venom and it is only in this context that venom toxicity can truly be measured  I used a new statistical framework to identify island and mainland populations of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake  Crotalus adamanteus  with distinct venom phenotypes and conducted reciprocal median lethal dosage  LD50  assays using wild  sympatric hispid cotton rats  Sigmodon hispidus  as a model   Islands are natural experiments that have been run for thousands of years and thus are exceptional systems for addressing predator prey coevolution because of changes in prey availability  limited gene flow due to isolation and low immigrant fitness  and accelerated evolution driven by positive selection on toxins and  if present  inhibitors resistant alleles   These reciprocal assays will demonstrate if snakes are locally adapted to sympatric prey and or if venom resistance in prey is driving venom evolution  
Insight into the speciation process  patterns of reproductive isolation in five stickleback species pairs that span the speciation continuum  To understand how new species form and what causes their collapse  we study how reproductive isolation evolves across the speciation continuum from the early stages of divergence to strongly isolated species to cases where isolation is lost  From this  we can determine which barriers contribute to total isolation early and late in the speciation process  infer the order in which barriers evolved during divergence or collapse  and gain insight into the selective and genetic mechanisms that underlie reproductive isolation  We explore these ideas by taking advantage of decades of previous work as well as our own data in stickleback fish  We examine five species pair systems that span the speciation continuum and measure many reproductive barriers in each species pair  often with multiple measures of each barrier from which we can calculate confidence intervals  We evaluate the importance of the type and number of barriers  pre  and postmating isolation  and asymmetrical isolation at different stages of the speciation process  Our study shows that two premating barriers  habitat and sexual isolation  are likely essential for initiating speciation  while intrinsic postmating isolation may be necessary to restrict reversal  Sexual isolation also seems to play an important role in furthering forward movement along the continuum  and  importantly  its loss facilitates reversal  We found asymmetries in individual premating and extrinsic  but not intrinsic  postmating barriers  Yet these asymmetric individual barriers combined to yield essentially no asymmetry in total isolation between species  By measuring many barriers across many species pairs that span the speciation continuum  we test fundamental predictions of ecological speciation and generate insight into the order in which barriers evolved during divergence and collapse  which is often intractable in studies that focus on a few barriers or a single species pair   
Comparative transcriptomic analyses of venoms from the Cottonmouth  Agkistrodon piscivorus  and Copperhead  Agkistrodon contortrix   Studies of adaptation aim to explain the links between genotypes  phenotypes  selection  and fitness   However  teasing apart these connections in natural systems is often difficult   Snake venom  which is necessary for feeding in those species that possess it  allows research that clearly links genotypes and phenotypes to fitness and can illuminate patterns of selection on traits directly related to fitness  Venoms are complex phenotypes with both intra  and interspecific variation  usually thought to have evolved within the context of predator prey arms races  Venom gland transcriptomes are a powerful tool for addressing questions concerning an ecologically critical and complex phenotype and allow for near complete characterization of not only high abundance toxin genes  but also nontoxin housekeeping genes  Here  we compare venom gland transcriptomes between two sister species  Agkistrodon piscivorus and A  contortrix  These species have different ecological niches  A  piscivorus has evolved a unique generalist diet  including being the only member of Viperidae to include fish in its diet  while A  contortrix possess a more traditional mammal and invertebrate based diet  
 Invasion and hybridization of the highly aggressive introduced reed  Phragmites australis  in the York River watershed   An introduced lineage of the common reed  Phragmites australis  has been aggressively invading estuarine habitats throughout North America  often replacing native Phragmites populations with dense monocultures that drastically alter ecosystem functioning   Because relatively few relic native P  australis populations are known to remain in the mid Atlantic region  the ability to confidently distinguish between the invasive and native forms has important implications for management practices   In collaboration with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  we have used morphological and genetic analyses to determine the extent of Phragmites invasion in the York River watershed  and identify remnant native stands that warrant conservation   Unlike throughout much of the Atlantic coast  our genetic analyses indicate that native P  australis populations do persist in the greater York River  although introduced P  australis is relatively widespread   Additionally  we have evidence that the potential for natural hybridization between the lineages may present a serious concern for land managers   This ongoing collaboration has successfully immersed introductory biology students in service learning that has immediate impacts for the local community  
Sexually selected traits and genotype by environment interactions  Sexually selected traits are often exquisitely sensitive to the environmental context experienced during development  bringing into question whether differences among individuals reflect heritable differences  Furthermore  when genotype by environment interactions are present the males that are most successful in one environment may be different from those that are the most successful in another environment  Low heritabilities and genotype by environment interactions both challenge the notion that males with large  elaborate traits are genetically superior and provide indirect benefts to choosy females  We bred thousands of leaf footed cactus bugs in a half sib  split brood quantitative genetics design to examine the influence of genes and the environment on sexually selected traits across three ecologically relevent contexts  We found that male weapons are highly responsive to developmental conditions and show little evidence of heritability  We compare and contrast these results with those for other traits in this species  Finally  we discuss heritability and genotype by environment interactions as they exist in natural settings    
 Increased egg viability  male mating ability and mating frequency evolve in populations of D  melanogaster selected for resistance to cold shok   Abstract Ability to resist temperature shock is an important component of fitness of insects and other ectotherms  We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock  We then investigated the evolution of larval survivorship  adult mortality  fecundity  egg viability and reproductive behaviour in these populations  Larval survivorship  adult mortality and fecundity post cold shock was not significantly different between selected and control populations  However  compared to the control populations  the selected populations laid significantly higher percentage of fertile eggs  egg viability  24 hours post cold shock  Interestingly  the selected populations had higher mating frequency both with and without cold shock  After being subjected to cold shock  males from the selected populations successfully mated with significantly more number of non virgin females and sired significantly more number of progeny compared to control males  Thus  our results  document the evolution of reproductive behaviour and egg viability in response to selection for cold shock resistance in D  melanogaster   
The Diversification of LINE Transposable Elements in Vertebrate Genomes  Patterns and Processes  The Diversification of LINE Transposable Elements in Vertebrate Genomes  Patterns and Processes  Akash Sookdeo and Stephane Boissinot  LINEs  Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements  constitute the dominant category of autonomously replicating retroelements in vertebrate genomes  They have been a significant source of evolutionary novelties and have considerably affected the size and structure of vertebrate genomes   In fact  with the exception of autopolyploidy  LINE abundance is the major determinant of genome size differences among vertebrates  The impact LINEs have on the evolution of their host depends on their abundance and diversity which result from the interactions between the rate of transposition  the intensity of selection against new inserts and the demographic history of populations  To decipher between these different processes we performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the LINEs in the genome of 12 vertebrate species representative of all major vertebrate lineages  mammals  reptiles  amphibians  fish   Two general patterns emerged  First  there is a clear difference between mammals and non mammalian vertebrates  LINEs in mammalian genomes have a very low diversity but are represented by extremely large copies number whereas non mammalian vertebrates have a large diversity of LINEs  each represented by small copy numbers  This suggests a fundamental difference in the way mammalian and non mammalian genomes interact with their intra genomic parasites  Second  we determined that  in all vertebrates  the diversification of LINEs is driven by the acquisition of novel promoter sequences  suggesting that novel LINE lineages emerge and amplify only when they do not compete with other lineages for host encoded transcription factors  We hypothesize that the emergence and replicative success of LINE lineages depends on their ability to colonize a novel transcriptional niche in the genome of their host  
Exploring pattern and process in the evolutionary history of the mycorrhizal symbiosis  The vast majority of plants form symbioses with soil fungi  which provide plants with nutrient uptake services in return for sugars from photosynthesis  Even though the symbiosis is widespread  several plant lineages have evolved the ability to exclude fungi from their roots  suggesting that the symbiosis is not always favoured by natural selection  To understand the causes of variation in the symbiosis  we used a  3000 taxon database and a fossil calibrated molecular phylogeny to reconstruct of the evolutionary history of the symbiosis  We also explored evolutionary associations between ecological climate niches and the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal  AM   Ecto Mycorrhizal  EM  and Non Mycorrhizal  NM  character states  Estimates of transition rates away from the ancestral AM state suggested that losses of the symbiosis  the NM state  are more frequent than transitions to the EM state  Nevertheless  transition rates back to the AM symbiosis from the NM state were an order of magnitude more frequent than losses  suggesting that natural selection tends to favour the evolution of this symbiosis  We found that transitions from the AM to the NM state and from the AM to the EM state were accompanied by a shift to colder climate niches  This pattern is consistent with previous reports of greater cold sensitivity in fungal lineages that form AM associations relative to fungal lineages that form EM associations  Cold climates may therefore restrict the evolution of the AM symbiosis  but not the EM symbiosis  These findings will assist future tests of causal hypotheses about the origin  maintenance and consequences of the mycorrhizal symbiosis  
Combining living and fossil taxa into phylogenies  the missing data issue  Living species represent less than 1  of all species that have ever lived  Ignoring fossil taxa may lead to misinterpretation of macroevolutionary patterns and processes such as trends in species richness  biogeographical history or paleoecology  This fact has led to an increasing consensus among scientists that both fossil and living taxa must be included in macroevolutionary studies  One approach  the Total Evidence Method  uses molecular data from living taxa and morphological data from both living and fossil taxa to infer phylogenies with both fossil and living taxa at the tips  Although the Total Evidence Method seems very promising  it requires a lot of data and is therefore likely to suffer from missing data issues which may affect its ability to infer correct phylogenies    In this study we assess the effect of missing data on tree topologies inferred from total evidence supermatrices  Using simulations we investigate three major factors that directly affect the completeness of the morphological part of the supermatrix   1  the proportion of living taxa with no morphological data   2  the amount of missing data in the fossil record and  3  the overall number of morphological characters in the supermatrix  We find that  in a Bayesian framework  difficulties in recovering a stable topology are mainly driven by the missing data in the molecular part of the matrix  for which fossil taxa have no data   In a Maximum Likelihood framework  however  topology is not directly affected by missing data per se  but by the number of morphological characters shared among the taxa  Therefore  the two main drivers of incorrect topologies are the overall number of morphological characters and the number of living species with no morphological data    Our results suggest that  in order to use total evidence methods  one should reduce the missing data in the morphological part of the supermatrix for living species and use a Maximum Likelihood framework to fix the topology prior to the overall Bayesian phylogenetic inference process  We apply our method to a comprehensive data set of both living and fossil primates  We find that using this integrative method modifies previous estimates of rates of body mass evolution within primates  
Simultaneous optimization of growth rate and thermal stability in bacteriophages under pleiotropic constraints  It has been hypothesized that tradeoffs may exist for the improvement of protein assembly rate and overall stability   In order to determine whether tradeoffs resulting from pleiotropic constraints prevented the simultaneous optimization of these two traits  we performed long term adaptive walks of replicate bacteriophage populations initiated from single plaque isolates under a two stage protocol  alternating selection for increased growth rate under standard lab culture conditions and for increased thermal stability in a high temperature heat shock environment   One set of replicate adaptations was performed using a genotype that had been previously adapted for optimal growth rate  ID8a80   and a second set of lines used the wild type ancestor of the first genotype  ID8    Our results indicate that in all lines  sequential fixation of the first few mutations proceeded with beneficial effects on only one phenotype at a time  sometimes with deleterious consequences for the alternative phenotype   At the end of adaptation  all lines showed great improvements in thermal stability  measured as death rate during a heat shock period   The pre adapted lines showed no decrease in growth rate at the end of adaptation  and the lines begun from the wild type ancestor achieved a similar growth rate to that of the line that was originally adapted strictly for increased growth rate   These results indicate that while individual mutations may be constrained by antagonistic pleiotropy  it may have little effect on long term evolution  
Ecological variation affects signal reliability in Gambusia hubbsi  In many models of sexual selection  conspicuous ornaments are preferred by mates because they indicate heritable signaler viability  To function as indicators  ornaments must maintain a proportional relationship between expression and viability  These indicators are called condition dependent signals  To maintain condition dependence  signaling costs must prevent males with low viability from expressing disproportionate conspicuous signals  Given ecological variation in signaling costs  it is likely that the strength of condition dependence varies concomitantly  In this study  we assess the effect of variable signal cost  predation risk  on the strength of condition dependence among 15 wild populations of Bahamas mosquitofish  Gambusia hubbsi  that use colorful dorsal fins in courtship displays  We found that the signal of interest  fin coloration  predicted body condition  However  this relationship was only seen in populations subject to predation from piscivorous fish  In contrast  populations without predators showed no signs of condition dependence suggesting that variation in ecological costs has important effects on communication system evolution  In summary  while our study addresses only one type of sexual signal  coloration   uses only one estimate of viability  condition   and focuses on a single type of signaling cost  predation   we confirm a crucial role for ecological signaling cost in communication  
Coevolution of Complexity as Seen by a Digital Hosts Adaptive Landscape  The world is populated by incredibly diverse and complex organisms  yet probably had only a single simple origin   While evolution often results in more complex organisms  complex traits are not necessarily adaptive  How can we reconcile the evolutionary process  which does not intrinsically produce complexity  with the overwhelmingly complex organisms all around us  One hypothesis is that arms races driven by antagonistic coevolution produce complexity as increasing defenses and counter defenses evolve  We find evidence for this hypothesis using coevolving digital organisms  where parasites steal processing power from their hosts  But  instead of trait escalation  we find that a diverse community of interacting hosts and parasites is necessary for complexity to evolve  We demonstrate that these community effects actually deform the hosts fitness landscape in a way that favors the evolution of increased complexity  These results highlight the importance of biotic interactions in evolution  and provide a hypothesis about how coevolution could drive complexity  In addition to direct selection for complex traits  we also find that hosts end up in a more evolvable region of the genetic landscape when they coevolved with parasites   
Clinal variation in floral color and flavonoids along alpine elevation gradients in Silene vulgaris  Spatial environmental heterogeneity can lead to divergent selection in populations  often leading to phenotypic divergence and local adaptation  The plant flavonoid biosynthetic pathway has been well characterized and is conserved among angiosperms  and the pathway structure allows us to make predictions about phenotypic divergence  which may co vary across environmental gradients  We monitored populations of the widespread bladder campion  Silene vulgaris  Caryophyllaceae   spanning 700 2100 m in the French Alps for two years  measuring traits associated with the flavonoid pathway  floral color  floral and foliar flavonoids  and herbivory  We predicted that with increasing elevation  more non anthocyanin flavonoids would be produced as a response to increased UV radiation  and that anthocyanins would accumulate to ameliorate stress associated with high elevation environments  We found evidence for adaptive divergence of floral color across elevational transects  where pairwise PST > FST  Anthocyanin  based floral color increased with elevation  as did flavonoids in leaves  However  there were no associations between the increase in flavonoid production with herbivory  Our results indicate that floral color and leaf flavonoid production are linked by means of shared upstream enzymes  and that selection likely acted on the flavonoid pathway  reinforcing the relationship   
Predator induced facultative group formation in Chlamydomonas depends on life history traits and the groups can be chimaeric   The evolution of multicellularity is a major transition in evolution  While the advantages of multicellularity  for example those related to increased size and division of labour could be responsible for its maintenance  the selective pressures and the role of kinship for its origin are not clear  A group of unicellular individuals staying or coming together with little or no division of labour can be a first step towards multicellularity and predation pressure might have played a dominant role at this stage  Using an established model system  the volvocales  the response of the unicellular Chlamydomonas to predation pressure was studied  In addition  the correlation between life history traits like cell size or swimming speed and the ability to form groups as well as the kin structure of groups were examined              Experimental data revealed that unicellular Chlamydomonas cells can defend themselves by coming together to form groups when co cultured in the presence of a protozoan predator  Peranema trichophorum  Group formation is facultative  It is induced only in the presence of predators or their culture filtrate and cells in the group revert to a unicellular stage once the selection is removed  Group formation is costly as the groups sink to the bottom and some cells die  Life history traits are important in group formation  smaller and less motile cells form groups more readily  Interestingly  groups were genetically heterogeneous suggesting that in these early stages of the transition to multicellularity  life history traits rather than genetic relatedness played a dominant role  
Independent origins of the avian Z chromosome reveal contrasting short  and long term dynamics of sex specific selection  Sex chromosomes provide unique opportunities to study the role of sex specific selection  and when contrasted with autosomes  can reveal the magnitude of sexual conflict acting throughout the genome  Birds are useful in studies of sex chromosome evolution for two reasons  First  they are female heterogametic  which makes it possible through comparisons with male heterogamety to identify the fundamental forces shaping sex chromosomes  Second  although avian sex chromosomes are orthologous throughout the clade  they have diverged multiple independent times  making it possible to identify convergence     We first mapped out the fine scale evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes in the Galloanserae  land and waterfowl  using a combination of genomic  transcriptomic and phylogenetic data  Our results indicate that independent inversions spread progressively across the sex chromosomes over long evolutionary periods  We then used this map of avian sex chromosome evolution to test the role of sex specific selection in shaping gene expression evolution  Our results reveal that over long term evolutionary history  the Z chromosome has been convergently and successively masculinized  Older regions of the Z chromosome are expressed more in males than females  indicating that masculinization accumulates over time  This is consistent with theoretical predictions that Z linked genes should be more often selected for male benefit alleles due to their unequal inheritance pattern  We next examined the role of mating system in driving masculinization of the Z chromosome over the short term   Our results suggest that recent changes in mating system are less important in driving patterns of Z linked masculinization  indicating that substantial lengths of evolutionary time are required to break down inter sexual correlation in gene expression  
Association mapping reveals the evolutionary forces maintaining genetic variation for gene expression   The genetic variation in phenotypic traits may be maintained by two processes  mutation selection balance and balancing selection  These processes are expected to have different effects on the allele frequencies of loci influencing phenotypic traits  making it possible to use experimentally determined genetic architecture to investigate the maintenance of variation  We took this approach using gene expression as a model trait  We measured expression and identified SNPs in 94 individuals collected from a large population of the outcrossing plant Capsella grandiflora using genome wide next generation RNA and DNA sequencing  We then conducted an association mapping study to determine the local genetic variants associated with gene expression  eQTLs  and identified a large number of SNPs that were significantly associated with the expression of nearby genes  These eQTLs are present in the population at lower allele frequencies than those SNPs that were not associated  suggesting that mutation selection balance largely drives genetic variation for gene expression  
Optimal Predator Learning and the Evolution of Mimicry  A major question in animal communication is why signals are often complex  involving multiple components  dimensions  or sensory modalities  One potential explanation is that signals evolve complexity because they face selection to be distinct from other signals  In Batesian mimicry  where undefended mimics evolve to resemble defended models  signals can evolve varying degrees of complexity  Models for Batesian mimics should experience selection to become distinct from their parasitic mimics  and respond by increasing the complexity of their signals  In support of this notion  models for Batesian mimics often evolve complex displays such as those found on noxious tropical butterflies  The conditions required for selection to favor the evolution of signal complexity remain underexplored  however        We hypothesize that the strength of selection to be distinct  and hence the subsequent degree of signal elaboration  increasing complexity   should be inversely proportional to the cost benefit ratio of attacking defended models versus undefended mimics  This is because a higher cost benefit ratio makes sampling defended mimics more costly  Therefore  predators should be less willing to pay the price of learning about more complex  distinctive signals  resulting in reduced selection for signal elaboration  To formalize this hypothesis  we present the results of a Bayesian model that employs stochastic dynamic programming to arrive at an optimal solution for predator behavior  This model illustrates ecological scenarios under which selection for convergence in signal evolution is highest  
Evidence for rapid adaptation to an environmental contaminant in a model songbird  Human induced rapid environmental change  including pollution  is the greatest threat to wildlife populations   Mounting evidence suggests that evolutionary responses to environmental change are becoming increasingly prevalent on a global scale  Evolutionary responses may be particularly important in the case of pollutants  which can have strong fitness effects  We performed a multigenerational dosing experiment examining the effects of methylmercury exposure on reproductive success in the zebra finch  Taeniopygia guttata   We found significant variation among full sibling families in the effects of methylmercury on several reproductive parameters  We also found increased reproductive success in the second generation of birds exposed to the highest doses of methylmercury relative to birds in the first generation of exposure  This suggests strong response to selection for mercury tolerance at higher doses  These results have important implications for the evolution of tolerance as well as risk assessment and wildlife conservation efforts on sites with legacy contamination  
AN UNUSUAL COLONIZATION SCENARIO AMONG GALçPAGOS ORGANISMS  ORIGIN AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ENDEMIC LEAF TOED GECKOS  PHYLLODACTYLIDAE  PHYLLODACTYLUS   In this study we re examine the biogeography of leaf toed geckos  Phyllodactylus  endemic to the Gal‡pagos islands  We aim to  i  test the multiple colonization hypothesis against the single colonization scenario proposed for most organisms in the archipelago   ii  estimate the age of colonization of Phyllodactylus  and  iii  evaluate the role of dispersal and vicariance in the evolution of these lizards  We sequenced six nuclear and four mitochondrial genes for all recognized species  except P  gilberti from Wolf  of Phyllodactylus from the Gal‡pagos and four species from South America  Phylogenetic relationships were evaluated with likelihood and Bayesian methods including estimation of divergence times and species trees  We used the inferred phylogeny to evaluate previous biogeographic hypotheses  Our results support a multiple colonization scenario as opposed to the single colonization scenario proposed for most terrestrial organisms in this archipelago  All but one species of Phyllodactylus in the Gal‡pagos belong to a single radiation  Founders of this radiation colonized the archipelago 13 2 million years ago  when islands currently above water had not yet emerged  Ten million years later  ancestors of P  darwini representing the second radiation colonized San Crist—bal  Similar to other Gal‡pagos organisms  the Pacific coast of South America seems to be the source for founders leading to the oldest radiation of leaf toed geckos  Unlike most Gal‡pagos endemics  however  P  darwini might have its origins in the Andes  Our phylogenetic hypotheses and recent paleogeographic data support both dispersal and vicariance as mechanisms leading to the radiation of leaf toed geckos in the Gal‡pagos  Our results are in agreement with recent literature demonstrating that the Gal‡pagos harbors high levels of unrecognized diversity  
Phylogenetic and environmental controls on the geographic range dynamics of woody plants since the Last Glacial Maximum  The size and location of a taxon s geographic range is dynamic   contracting  expanding  or shifting in location over time in response to changes in suitable environmental and ecological conditions  Despite this lability  some previous comparisons across lineages have found that range sizes are conserved  or more similar among closely related than distantly related taxa  Such similarities are unexpected under an allopatric model of speciation which predicts asymmetric range sizes between sister taxa at least early in their histories  However  conservatism in life history traits may counteract such asymmetry  particularly if closely related taxa share dispersal traits which make them either  rapid expanders  or  slow movers   Here we assess whether geographic range is conserved by focusing on the phylogenetic structure of geographic range shifts among woody plants in eastern North America following the Last Glacial Maximum using a molecular phylogeny and geographic data from the pollen fossil record  We find that the velocities with which woody plant genera shifted their range limits between 16 10 ka were positively correlated over time   i e   lineages that moved further in one interval also tended to move further in subsequent intervals   with the strength of this correlation weakening towards the present day  16 ka  intervals of time  Lastly  we assess the phylogenetic structure of life history traits and their correlation with biotic velocities  
Between sex genetic covariance constrains the evolution of sexual dimorphism in  everyones favourtite  Drosophila melanogaster  Males and females share much of their genome  and as a result  intralocus sexual conflict is generated when selection on a shared trait differs between the sexes  This conflict can be partially or entirely resolved via the evolution of sex specific genetic variation that allows each sex to approach  or possibly achieve  its optimum phenotype  thereby generating sexual dimorphism  However  shared genetic variation between the sexes can impose constraints on the independent expression of a shared trait in males and females  hindering the evolution of sexual dimorphism  Here  we examine genetic constraints on the evolution of sexual dimorphism in Drosophila melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon  CHC  expression  We use the extended G matrix  which includes the between sex genetic covariances that constitute the B matrix  to compare genetic constraints on two sets of CHC traits that differ in the extent of their sexual dimorphism  We find significant genetic constraints on the evolution of further dimorphism in the least dimorphic traits  but no such constraints for the most dimorphic traits  We also show that the genetic constraints on the least dimorphic CHCs are asymmetrical between the sexes  Our results suggest that there is evidence both for resolved and ongoing sexual conflict in D  melanogaster CHC profiles  
Utilizing genotyping by sequencing to elucidate Neotropical army ant evolution  As keystone predators in Neotropical forests  hundreds of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms associate with the 12 known species of Eciton  which exert strong top down effects on community structure in the leaf litter  Despite their clear ecological importance and strong history of research  a comprehensive phylogenetic and biogeographic study is lacking for the important clade  This absence of phylogenetic resolution has been a substantial impediment to determining ecological and evolutionary dynamics  and presents an opportunity to investigate broader mechanisms of diversification in the Neotropics  Using the high throughput method genotyping by sequencing  GBS   we harvested SNPs from across the Eciton genome to infer the clade s phylogenetic history and their colonization of Neotropical habitats  This work contributes both to a better understanding of the ecological impact of Neotropical army ants as well as the significance of biogeographic processes in macroevolutionary dynamics   
Repeated cis regulatory evolution underlies convergent phenotypic adaptation in butterflies   Convergent evolution provides a rare  natural experiment with which to test the predictability of adaptation at the molecular level  Little is known about the molecular basis of convergence over macro evolutionary timescales  Using a combination of positional cloning  gene expression analyses  and developmental data  we demonstrate that parallel wing pattern variation in two distantly related butterflies is controlled by cis regulatory variation in the same gene  WntA   Population genomic sequencing reveals the specific variants controlling convergent mimetic polymorphism across 65 million years of evolution   By pinpointing the repeated modulation of a core developmental process in the generation of an adaptive trait  our results reveal a strikingly predictable molecular basis for phenotypic convergence over deep evolutionary time  
 The contribution of genes and the environment on traits important for pre and post copulatory reproductive success in the cactus bug  Narnia femorata   Sexual selection has resulted in some of the most elaborate traits in the animal kingdom  Within population variation in the expression of these traits is likely governed by genes  the environment  and by gene by environment  GxE  interactions  The vast majority of studies partitioning out the influence of these factors have focused on sexually selected traits important for attracting and defending mates  However  sexual selection does not end at mate acquisition  post copulatory sexual selection  such as what occurs during sperm competition  can have a profound impact on an animal s reproductive success  Despite this realization  the number of studies evaluating the genetic and environmental influence on traits important for post copulatory reproductive success are few and even less common are studies examining these effects on pre and post copulatory traits concurrently  This research is essential  however  since pre and post copulatory traits may not develop in isolation  resource allocation decisions may result in the increase of one trait at the expense of growth in another trait  In this study  we examined the contributions of genes  the environment  and GxE interactions on femur and testes size in Narnia femorata using a half sib split brood design across three realistic developmental environments   Male Narnia femorata display and grapple with each other over using their enlarged hind femurs and males with larger femurs are more likely to become dominant  gaining access to high quality territories that attract females  However  females mate multiply  making sperm competition common  thus testes size is likely an important factor in male post copulatory reproductive success  Our results indicate that heritability for both traits is low and that the environment plays a significant role in determining adult trait expression  Additionally  we found that the environment affects the scaling relationship between femurs and testes  potentially suggesting that the allocation decision rule for these two traits may shift across developmental environments  However  we did not find any GxE interactions for either trait likely due to the low and non significant heritability of these traits  
RNA seq Reveals Regional Differences in Transcriptome Response to Heat Stress in the Marine Snail Chlorostoma funebralis  Southern California  USA  populations of the intertidal marine snail Chlorostoma  formerly Tegula  funebralis are generally exposed to higher air and water temperatures than northern California populations   Previous studies have shown that southern populations are more tolerant of heat stress than northern populations   To assess the potential role of gene regulation in these regional differences  we examined transcriptome responses to thermal stress in two southern and two northern populations of C  funebralis   Snails from the four populations were acclimated to a common lab environment  exposed to a heat stress representative of natural low tide conditions  and then analyzed using RNA Seq to characterize changes in gene expression associated with stress and differences in expression across geographic regions   Changes in expression following stress were dominated by genes involved in apoptosis  the inflammatory response  response to mis and unfolded proteins  and ubiquitination of proteins   Heat shock proteins  Hsps  were up regulated in both northern and southern populations   However  while the magnitude of the response was significantly greater in northern populations for the majority of Hsp70s  the southern populations showed a greater up regulation for roughly half of the Hsp40s  which are co chaperones for Hsp70s   Differential expression analysis of the control versus treatment genes in the northern and southern populations respectively revealed that 56 genes  many involved in the inflammation and immune response  responded to heat stress only in the northern populations   Moreover  several of the molecular chaperones and antioxidant genes that were not differentially expressed in the southern populations instead showed higher constitutive expression under control conditions compared to the northern populations   The expression levels of some of these constitutive genes such as superoxide dismutase were also found to positively correlate with survival following heat stress   This suggests that expression of these genes has evolved a degree of  frontloading  that may contribute to the higher thermal tolerance of southern populations   
Why do female birds sing  Contrasting selection on males and females and the evolution of ornamentation in birds   Ornamentation  or the exaggeration of a trait unrelated or detrimental to survival  is often assumed to result from female choice sexual selection and or male male competition  In birds  however  elaborate ornamentation  including plumage  song  and various courtship behaviors  is common in both sexes  To investigate the factors favoring the evolution of mutual ornamentation within a comparative framework  a trait is required that is geographically and taxonomically well studied  easy to quantify  relatively common  and as free of confounding pressures from natural selection as possible  The presence or absence of song in male and female birds fit these criteria  With a global dataset containing broad ecological  social  and environmental information on 10 257 species of birds along with a phylogeny of 9 993 species  we quantitatively examined the pressures driving the evolution of male and female bird song  using phylogenetic methods to test the associations among these traits  We found that male song responds more strongly to ecological pressures  whereas female song evolves in conjunction with both social and ecological pressures  with other factors  including environmental drivers  playing a secondary role  These divergent correlations correspond to the asymmetric distribution of song across the world and within the avian phylogenetic tree and can be further used to predict patterns of avian speciation and extinction across time  
Tick tock goes the croc  Three genome drafts indicate slow molecular evolution in crocodilians and provide insight into archosaur evolution  We present genome drafts of three crocodilians  Alligator mississippiensis  the American alligator   Crocodylus porosus  the saltwater crocodile   and Gavialis gangeticus  the Indian gharial   each representing one of the three extant families of the Order Crocodylia  The larger clade that includes turtles  crocodilians  and birds is noteworthy in the exceptionally slow karyotype evolution in all three groups and slow morphological evolution of turtles and crocodilians  We find that this slow rate of evolution is recapitulated at all levels within crocodilian genomes including nucleotide substitutions  insertions and deletions  transposable element content and movement  and chromosomal synteny   Furthermore  analysis of heterozygosity indicates that each of the three crocodilians suffered a reduction in population size through the Pleistocene  Finally  using these crocodilian genomes  multiple avian genomes  and multiple outgroups  we inferred the genome of the archosaurian common ancestor  providing a tool to investigate the genetic starting material of crocodilians  birds  and dinosaurs  
Conserved Core Genes are under Positive Selection in a Long Term Escherichia coli Evolution Experiment  In this study  we ask whether those genes that are evolving fastest in a long term E  coli evolution experiment also tend to be evolving faster in nature than typical genes  or alternatively  whether the genes targeted in that evolution experiment are in nature more slowly evolving i e  more conserved  than typical genes  To this end  we computed a set of 1968 panorthologs  single copy genes found in the ancestral strain REL606 as well as 59 published E  coli genomes  These published sequences include lab strains  pathogens  commensals  and a few environmental isolates  We found that beneficial mutations in the long term lines tend to occur in genes that are strongly conserved in E  coli as well as in more diverged bacterial species  Further  we found that non synonymous mutations tend to fall more often in panorthologs than in the rest of the genome  Although panorthologs make up 48  of coding sequence in REL606  109 out of 161 non synonymous mutations fall into this set  p value E  coli evolution  even though they are very simple and seemingly unremarkable given their culturing conditions in a minimal salts medium with limiting glucose at 37C  We speculate that what may be most novel  however  is the constancy of the environment  its biophysical simplicity  and the absence of microbial competitors and parasites  
Incorporating Evolutionary History into Ecological Niche Modeling  Many fundamental questions in ecology  evolution  and conservation biology require estimates of species  environmental tolerances  Environmental niche models  ENMs  sometimes referred to as species distribution models  use species occurrence data in order to construct these estimates  Recent advances have made these models more accessible and easier to use in a comparative framework  and as a result they are being used at a rapidly increasing rate across ecology  evolution  and conservation biology  Useful though these approaches are  there are fundamental limits to our ability to model the niche through presence only data  as these data are subject to many phenomena such as biotic interactions  sampling bias  and dispersal limitation that limit their utility for niche estimation  Niche modeling is currently dominated by machine learning methods that treat species  responses to their environment as a  black box  phenomenon about which no prior information exists  Although these methods have been useful  there are other data sources that may  if incorporated appropriately into the modeling process  serve to partially overcome many of the limitations of presence only data  One such data source is the evolutionary history of the species being modeled   
Swimming with the Red Queen  Adaptive Evolution of a ZP domain Glycoprotein in Galaxiid Fishes  We describe protein sequences for a uromodulin like larval glycoprotein  LGP  from 21 species of galaxiid fishes  with a MRCA about 30 Ma   These have been derived from both genomic DNA and cDNA  by conventional and Roche 454 sequencing   LGP shows a fast rate of evolution and an exceptionally strong signal of positive selection over the entire coding region  as evidenced by dN dS > 1   Across all sequences  182 336  54   of residues are variable  many substitutions are profound non conservative and include in frame indels   Genetic distances are  on average  2 4x larger for coding region  996 bp  than introns  1459 bp    We identify 20 30 positively selected  dN dS > 4  amino acid sites using a variety of approaches   By homology modelling  we show that these proteins can fold following the recently elucidated structure for ZP3  and that the positively selected amino acids occur in loop regions of both ZP N and ZP C domains   The high rate of evolution is further accelerated in lineages that have lost the marine larval phase   Like other ZP domain proteins  which are categorized as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily  LGP shows features expected of an extracellular polymeric cell surface protein and appears to be highly glycosylated   Taken together  these features make it likely that LGP is an immune protein   This idea is supported by initial gene expression analysis showing that the gene is active in developing skin and gill arches  which are likely conduits for pathogens   These fish  therefore  appear to be engaged in a Red Queen arms race  which further accelerates when larvae adopt a freshwater environment through a change in life history  exposing themselves to a new range of pathogens and parasites  
Comparative Phylogeography of Lizards from the Brazilian Cerrado  Cerrado  the Brazilian Savanna  is the second largest biome of South America and one of the world s 25 biodiversity hotspots  The squamate levels of endemism in this biome are higher than any other vertebrate group  with 42  of Cerrado s lizard species being endemic  Recent studies suggest a major role of ancient vicariant processes in shaping the biogeographic history of the region  However  there is still a great debate considering the evolutionary origins and diversification patterns of the Cerrado herpetofauna  We investigated biogeographic history in the Brazilian Cerrado using co distributed lizards as a research subject  We used species distribution modelling  past and present   Sanger sequencing and Next Generation sequencing  anchored phylogenomics  to reconstruct the phylogeographic history of three Cerrado lizards  Gymnodactylus amarali  Phyllodactylidae   Micrablepharus atticolus  Gymnophtalmidae   and Tropidurus itambere  Tropiduridae   Using a hypothesis testing framework that combined paleoclimatic and coalescent based methods we retrieved evolutionary patterns consistent with the geological history of the Cerrado  Results indicate a number of divergent clades within the three species that possibly relate to cryptic speciation  whereas phylogeographic patterns appear linked to the tectonic uplift of the Central Brazilian Plateau  
Clonal Selection in a Unisexual Vertebrate  Kin selection theory states that individuals should favor their kin at the cost of their own fitness when the benefits of inclusive fitness outweigh the costs  In clonal species  relatedness is high and kin selection would predict stronger selection favoring identical clones when compared to other clonal lineages  I studied this theory using the clonal fish the Amazon molly  Poecilia formosa   Females produce daughters that are identical to themselves and each other  and are sexual parasites to their parental species  They overlap and compete in many aspects of their ecological niche  behavioral  and life history parameters  Understanding the maintenance of sexual unisexual species is a challenge because it violates competition theories  Behavioral differences between sexual unisexual species may play a prominent role in allowing these species to overlap in the same ecological niche  such as aggression regulated via kinship  Here  I demonstrate that these females can recognize and prefer sister clones over non sister clones  Familiarity was ruled out as viable explanation  Furthermore  I was able to show that Amazon mollies were using a combination of sensory channels to discriminate between sister and non sister clones  Females responded strongest to visual only cues  however  they were more active when chemical cues were present  Moreover  I found that Amazon mollies could even adjust their aggressive behaviors between different clonal lineages  Together  this data suggests that Amazon mollies are able to identify identical clonal sisters using both visual and chemical cues and regulate their aggressiveness towards them when compared to non sister clones and their sexual host  
Species versus subspecies designations in Hercules beetles  quantitative delimitation using multiple data types and an integrative Bayesian approach  With the recent attention and focus on quantitative methods for species delimitation  an overlooked  and equally important issue regards what has actually been delimited  This study highlights the arbitrariness in how taxonomic distinctions  and in particular species and subspecies  are assigned  and the downstream consequences of these decisions for biodiversity and conservation studies  Specifically  we use a model based delimitation approach to show that in the Hercules beetles  genus Dynastes  there is no statistical difference in the probability that putative taxa represent different species  irrespective of whether they were given species or subspecies designations  Moreover  by considering multiple data types  as opposed to relying exclusively on genetic data alone  we show that the putatively delimited species do not represent similar points along the dynamic lineage splitting spectrum  For example  the taxa differ in the degree to which they are statistically distinguishable based an evolutionary model for phenotypic divergence  as well as the extent to which genetic data indicates that they belong to independent lineages  as modeled under the coalescent  Because both phenotypic and genetic data are analyzed in a common Bayesian framework for delimiting species  our study provides a framework for investigating whether disagreements in species boundaries among data types reflect  i  actual discordance with the actual history of lineage splitting  or instead  ii  differences among data types in the amount of time required for differentiation to become apparent among the delimited taxa  We discuss how the answers to these questions have ramifications not only for how and what characters are used to delimit species  but can also provide insights into the diverse processes involved in the origin and maintenance of species boundaries  
Identifying Drivers of Island Speciation on an Ancient Tropical Island Using Next Generation Sequencing Data  Tropical ecosystems often harbor diverse and ancient lineages that have accumulated over the course of their long history  This allows them to serve as excellent models to test hypotheses regarding biotic diversification  The Sunda Shelf region of Indonesia is exceptional for the study of tropical systems because of its dynamic geological history paired with a climatological stability that presents a unique opportunity to study island diversification in an ancient tropical setting  We have chosen Sumatra as a site to test island diversification models  specifically comparing in situ diversification against vicariance and dispersal  Using data collected entirely from next generation sequencing technologies  including full mitochondrial genomes  we examine these models using dense sampling of two species complexes  frogs from the genus Rhacophorus and geckos from the genus Cyrtodactylus  Likelihood and Bayesian analyses reveal evidence for in situ diversification within Sumatran Rhacophorus  but the traditional vicariance and dispersal model within the Cyrtodactylus   This work will help to identify the types of speciation processes most important to tropical diversification  
 Cavity nesting makes flycatchers fecund and fly farther  evolutionary links between cavity nesting  clutch size and migration in the Muscicapidae    The ecology of cavity nesting in passerine birds has been studied extensively  Yet there are no phylogenetic comparative studies that quantify differences in life history traits between cavity and open nesting birds in a passerine family  Here we test existing hypotheses regarding the evolutionary significance of cavity nesting in the Old World flycatchers  Family  Muscicapidae   We inferred a multi locus phylogeny of 246 species  which we subsequently used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cavity nesting and quantify correlations between nest types and specific life history traits  Within a phylogenetic generalized linear model framework  we found that maximum clutch size is larger in cavity nesting lineages  Moreover  cavity nesting species are larger than open nesting species in high latitudes  Finally  we found that gains and losses of migratory behavior occur far more often in cavity nesting lineages than open nesting taxa  suggesting that cavity nesting may have played a crucial role in the evolution of migratory behavior  Together  these findings suggest that there are important macroevolutionary links between the evolution of cavity nesting  clutch size  interspecific competition and migratory behavior in a large clade of songbirds  the Old World flycatchers   
Gene flow dynamics between two Indian fruit bats  what can whole genome scans reveal   Sympatry provides an opportunity to understand speciation dynamics and the biology of isolation between divergent lineages  The identification and study of hybrid zones remains a major challenge when interacting species overlap in morphology  The Cynopterine fruit bats present such an interesting case allowing the evaluation of the evolutionary consequences of sympatry  Using a set of nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences we had previously demonstrated the presence of ancient gene flow  obtained evidence of enhanced genetic isolation in and local adaptation in sympatry  In the present study  we have used reduced representation libraries  ddRAD  to obtain thousands of snps across the genome of 48 individuals from both species  We further addressed the question of gene flow and isolation in sympatry and present our findings  
Paternity in the NGS era  Understanding patterns of parentage assignment is essential to comprehend various processes in natural systems  Till now most our understanding of paternity analysis in wild animals has been based on microsatellite data  In present study we test the utility of reduced representation whole genome sequencing  WGS  for parentage analysis  especially for low quality samples  Using short nosed fruit bat as a study species we compare the power of WGS data in assigning paternity  We compare the parentage assignments based on WGS data to previously published microsatellite based assignment  We further utilize WGS data to understand mate choice in this species  Our previous work suggested a role of post copultory mate choice for genetic compatibility  We extend our finding based on whole genome patterns  
Experimental evidence of soil mediated local adaptation of aphids to plants  Plants are intimately associated with soil microbes and foliar feeding insects  This gives rise to three way interactions that have important consequences for the functioning and evolution of these organisms  Although during the last decade above  and belowground interactions have received considerable attention  the consequences of plant soil interactions for insect evolution remain still largely unexplored  To shed light on this matter  I tested experimentally whether insect herbivores could be adapted to plant populations by mediation of the soil community  Using the dune grass Ammophila arenaria  the aphid Schizaphis rufula and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  AMF   I conducted a series of rearing experiments in which aphid performance was compared on different grass populations  To test whether soil AMF could be mediating the interaction with the aphid  insect multiplication was compared on plants growing in sterilized soil inoculated with local or non local soil communities and AMF   The results of the experiments showed that not only the soil community was important for aphid performance  but also its origin  local vs  non local   In general  local combinations of plants and soil communities had a greater influence on aphid multiplication than non local combinations  These results highlight the importance of the soil biota  and AMF in particular  to understand plant insect interactions from an evolutionary perspective  
EDA signaling and phenotypic evolution of sculpins  Cottus  after admixture  A hybrid lineage of sculpins  Cottus  resembles one of the ancestral species  C  perifretum  more than the other one  C  rhenanus  in phenotypic features  This contrasts with the expectation of hybrid intermediacy because most of the genome is thoroughly admixed  Thus  it is likely that phenotypic traits are subject to directional selection  Two of the concerned traits  the scale like skin prickling and body shape  represent a common source of variation among a number of Cottus species  The Ectodysplasin  EDA  signaling pathway provides promising candidates to investigate the genetic basis of these traits because it is known to affect the development of dermal bones and scales in fishes  We identified and mapped Cottus EDA signaling pathway components and performed quantitative trait locus  QTL  mapping for prickling and body shape  A single genomic region that affects prickling in Cottus was detected  This region contains the EDA receptor  Edar  but none of the other EDA pathway genes  The same QTL region also shows effects on body shape  In situ hybridization experiments confirmed that Edar expression is associated with the development of prickling  A population genomic analysis of the admixed Cottus gene pool showed that Edar genomic ancestry is biased towards C  perifretum  which agrees with the phenotypic similarity of invasive Cottus with that species  Taken together  the data implies that the Edar allele inherited from C  perifretum strongly determines phenotypic variation of hybrid Cottus  EDA signaling constitutes a key adaptive trait in stickleback and our results suggest that the same pathway may contribute to conspicuous phenotypic variation in Cottus  
 Gene expression profiles  not anonymous loci  match phenotypes within an avian species complex  Fringillidae  Acanthis    Understanding what constitutes a species is a vital enterprise of evolutionary biology  Recently  reduced representation genome wide datasets have provided unprecedented resolution of species boundaries  Moreover  transcriptomic studies have linked patterns of differential gene expression to phenotypic variation in a variety of systems  However  few studies have considered large panels of anonymous loci in combination with gene expression data to delimit species within recent radiations of non model organisms  Here  we combine SNPs across many thousands of loci with gene expression data to evaluate species limits in redpolls  Acanthis   The redpoll complex is a widespread  phenotypically diverse lineage of finches whose taxonomic status remains unresolved  Redpolls breed throughout much of the Holarctic  however  previous studies have found little to no genetic differentiation between geographically disparate populations or morphologically distinct races  Here  we evaluate species limits in the redpoll complex using high throughput sequencing and ecological niche modeling  We evaluate genomic differentiation at 3631 loci across 86 individuals using ddRAD Seq  including all three of the currently recognized species  Acanthis flammea  A  hornemanni  and A  cabaret  and compare gene expression profiles of ten individuals  including both A  flammea and A  hornemanni  using RNA Seq  We also construct ecological niche models  ENMs  for A  flammea and A  hornemanni in North America to evaluate whether favored abiotic breeding conditions differ between these taxa  Our analyses suggest that all currently recognized species of redpolls are part of a single panmictic metapopulation  However  our RNA Seq analyses indicate that there are over 200 differentially expressed transcripts between A  flammea and A  hornemanni  and overall gene expression profiles cluster by phenotype  Our ENMs indicate that A  flammea and A  hornemanni do not share identical niches  but they are more similar than expected given the range of abiotic conditions available to redpolls throughout North America  Taken together  our findings suggest that gene expression may play an important role in the generation of phenotypes that distinguish locally adapted populations of redpolls  which are best treated as a single  phenotypically diverse species   
Soil microbial communities cause differential selection and plasticity of flowering time in the wild mustard Boechera stricta  The timing of flowering in complex natural habitats is known to be both genetically controlled and sensitive to multiple biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli  However  the impact of soil dwelling microbes on flowering time and on patterns of natural selection has rarely been considered  We transplanted seedlings from 48 naturally inbred populations of the wild crucifer Boechera stricta into potting soil inoculated with a soil microbial community extracted from each of 4 natural B  stricta habitats  We then measured plant height and leaf number  date of first flower  and number of fruits produced  Microbial community did not affect plant size  but shifted flowering time by up to 2 2 days  The two B  stricta subspecies showed a nearly significant difference in the extent of flowering time plasticity in response to soil microbes  but we found no evidence for within subspecies genetic variation for plasticity  Soil microbes also altered the relationship between flowering time and fruit set  even reversing the direction of selection in one community  Deep 16S rDNA sequencing revealed three phyla  Proteobacteria  Crenarchaeota  and Acidobacteria  and several families that were differentially abundant in soils associated with slowest and fastest flowering  Our results show that soil microbes have the potential to alter flowering time as well as the intensity of selection on flowering time in nature  
A tale of two lineages  contrasting patterns of diversification in saxicoline lizard lineages of the Australian monsoon tropics  While Savannah biomes dominant large areas of the globe  around 20  of the earth s land area   the major climatic and topographic variables that have shaped diversification in these ecologically and economically important regions remain poorly understood  We are undertaking a project to understand diversification processes in a suite of ecologically divergent geckos from the vast savannahs of northern Australia  Multilocus work on the large saxicoline Oedura  velvet geckos  of the Kimberley region has revealed two divergent lineages with broadly overlapping distributions  Both are closely associated with outcropping rocks  and have a long history of intraregional diversification dating back well into the Miocene  However  one lineage is widespread  with an exceptional number of divergent parapatric mitochondrial lineages  while the other comprises two highly disjunct and morphologically distinct forms  including a recently discovered micro endemic restricted to a single rocky range in the south Kimberley   Nuclear loci support the evolutionary distinctiveness of isolated populations in the latter lineage  but suggest a much more complicated and unresolved history of periodic fragmentation and geneflow in its more widespread congener  Our data support the hypothesis that rock outcrops and ranges within the savannahs of northern Australia have mediated long persistence and divergence of mitochondrial lineages  but also suggest differing ecological and physiological limitations of saxicoline lineages can result in contrasting evolutionary outcomes to this diversification process  
Differences in evolutionary patterns and rates of general cognitive ability compared to neuroanatomical indicators in the primate phylogeny  Various neuroanatomical indicators  NIs  are frequently used as proxies for general cognitive ability  g  in comparative studies  however their evolutionary patterns and rates have never been compared  With a sample of 174 primate species from all superfamilies  we tested the following predictions based on recent findings involving coefficients of additive variance in the homininan lineage   1  evolutionary rates for g will be faster than those for NIs   2  g will less phylogenetically conserved  and  3  evolutionary models fitted to g and to NIs will present at least moderately distinct parameter values  We obtained species means for g and for the most used NIs in comparative studies  neocortex ratio  neocortex size size of rest of brain   neocortex residualized  and phylogenetically residualized  against body size  brain size likewise residualized both ways  absolute brain size  and absolute neocortex size  Evolutionary rates   2  with log transformed values  were significantly faster for g than for NIs residualized against body size  four to twelve times  Cohen s d ranged from  5 to 1 3  depending on the evolutionary model fitted   and than for absolute NIs and for body size  two to three times  Cohen s d  4 to 1 1   Phylogenetic signal  PS  was significantly different from zero and from unity for g and for residualized NIs using Pagel s   but was smaller for g  and was equal to unity for absolute NIs and body size  Using Blomberg and colleagues  K  PS was nonsignificantly different from zero only for g  suggesting g is not importantly more similar among closely related primate taxa than among distantly related ones  whereas K surpassed unity only for absolute NIs and body size  indicating phylogenetic conservatism  To test prediction three we analyzed the fit of each variable to the Brownian motion     PS smaller than unity      acceleration   Ornstein Uhlenbeck  stabilizing selection   and Early Burst  exponentially decreasing niche filling  models  Although relative AICc model weights for g did not differ strongly from those for body size corrected NIs  with the   model as best fit   g presented a   parameter estimate around ten times larger  indicating stronger rate acceleration  The relative model weights for absolute brain and neocortex sizes greatly differed from the other variables however  and strongly conformed to the patterns presented by body size  Early Burst and Brownian motion models fitted best   Finally  g presented selection regime shifts in different nodes from NIs  Predictions were largely corroborated  the limitations and benefits of using the various NIs as proxies for g in comparative studies are discussed  
Developmental Mechanisms for Novel Morphological Evolution  Origin and Diversification of the Avian Skull  Comprising 30 orders and over 10 000 species  birds are the most successful land vertebrates and much of their success can be attributed to beak shape variation  My group studies developmental mechanisms responsible for differences in shapes of avian beaks by taking advantage of the natural diversity of beak shapes of songbirds  including the iconic Darwin s Finches   Their highly diverse beak shapes represent a classic example of adaptive radiation  niche partitioning  and rapid morphological evolution  We recently mathematically modeled beak developmental evolution and uncovered developmental mechanisms that control beak development  which allow for extensive morphological variation in beak shapes but also place significant developmental constraints on what kind of variation can be produced   At the large scale evolutionary level  all modern birds  Class Aves  are a crown group of division Archosauria  the  ruling reptiles    a large clade of diapsid reptiles that appeared about 250 million years ago and which also includes more basal archosaurs  The bird face is profoundly modified compared to its non avian reptilian antecedents  To understand the significance of bird specific changes  we recently performed a morphometric analysis of skulls from basal archosaurs to theropod dinosaurs  to primitive and modern birds  Remarkably  such analyses already revealed an important role for heterochrony in the origin of the bird skulls from non avian theropods   We hypothesized that such profound morphological changes in avian skull morphology were driven by alterations of their molecular patterning and investigated the origin of the avian skull combining geometric morphometrics  comparative developmental analysis and functional embryological tests   Our studies revealed the morphological distinctiveness of the bird rostrum as fused  elongate premaxillae and demonstrated a relatively simple regulatory molecular adjustment that produced the bird face  enabled avian jaw kinesis and allowed the beak to diversify as an independent module   
Positive selection drives frequency increase of a young chromosomal inversion  Chromosomal inversions play important roles in species divergence as well as adaptive evolution  and genetic elements controlling important traits are often mapped within inversions  Without effective recombination  chromosomal inversions that are fixed among lineages suppress gene flow  thereby allowing the accumulation of neutral as well as adaptive divergence  It is still unclear  however  what are the forces that contribute to the initial frequency increase of young inversions  Since adaptive mutations may arise before or after the establishment of chromosomal inversions  studies on young inversions is necessary  Three hypotheses explain the spread of young inversions  Under the  neutral hypothesis   genetic drift governs the evolution of young inversions  For the  direct advantage hypothesis   an inversion has direct advantage over local non inverted  standard  haplotypes due to meiotic drive or genetic changes caused by the inversion event  Under the  introgression hypothesis   while both local inverted and standard haplotypes contain adapted alleles in multiple loci  the inversion gains advantage over local standard haplotypes by suppressing recombination with non adaptive introgressing standard haplotypes  Here we provide one of the first empirical and extensive investigations of these hypotheses by examining a young chromosomal inversion in Boechera stricta  This inversion is at high frequency in a local population in the hybrid zone between East and West subspecies  While genomic microsatellites show high polymorphism in both inverted and standard individuals  inversion linked markers are less polymorphic in inverted than in standard individuals  This is consistent with the selective sweep of a young mutation and does not support the  neutral hypothesis   Between local inverted and standard West genotypes  we observed no inversion related genetic or phenotypic effects  nor altered expression of seven genes near the breakpoints of this rearrangement  hence the  direct advantage hypothesis  is not supported  To test the  introgression hypothesis   we performed quantitative trait locus  QTL  mapping between inverted West and standard East genotypes  The inversion has significantly higher fitness than the introgressing standard haplotype  In addition  analysis of standard West and East haplotypes identified two separate QTL in the inversion region controlling phenology  an ecologically important trait under strong selection in the natural environment  Together  these results support the  introgression hypothesis   This study is one of the first to test a range of hypotheses explaining the origin and establishment of chromosomal inversions  which have fundamental importance in species divergence and local adaptation  
FlatNJ  A Novel Network Based Approach to Visualize Evolutionary and Biogeographical Relationships  We introduce FlatNJ  a new method for producing a special type of phylogenetic networks known as planar split networks  Properties of these networks will be discussed by showing a few application examples followed by an overview of the method itself  which generalizies the popular NeighborNet method  Planar split networks are a type of phylogenetic networks that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings  facilitating exploratory data analysis  They can be used to detect and visualize potential relationships between sequence evolution and other aspects of a data set such as  for example  the geographic distribution of the corresponding organisms as well as indicate possible conflict in the data  e g   in case of recombination   The main advantage of using planar split networks instead of phylogenetic trees is their ability to provide a more complete overview of the data when a single tree is not appropriate  
The co evolution of altruism and collective movement  Altruism is one of the most puzzling phenomena in evolutionary ecology  because a group of altruists is susceptible to invasion by cheaters  However  altruists can sustain if they interact more often among themselves than with defectors  This condition  called positive assortment  is typically thought to arise due to mechanisms such as kin recognition  limited dispersal  and or reciprocity  Even in the absence of the above mechanisms  structured populations of multiple groups demes may facilitate positive assortment  Across many taxa  collectively moving animals spontaneously form groups that merge and split  Such groups are typically driven by local flocking interactions  such as tendencies to be attracted to and orient with neighbors   In this context  we explore whether dynamic group formation of animal groups can provide a mechanism for positive assortment  Here  we present an agent based co evolutionary model of altruism and collective movement  where each individual possesses two evolvable traits  local flocking tendency  and cooperative defective tendency  We show that starting from purely solitary defectors  strong altruism can co evolve with collective movement  resulting in a polymorphic population of altruists and defectors  We find that positive assortment is achieved through differences in the evolved local flocking tendencies of altruists and defectors  The groups exhibit spontaneous self sorting  as individuals with larger flocking tendency move together more than others  
Male limited evolution shapes sexual dimorphism in longevity  Sexes age at different rates and have different life expectancies across the animal kingdom but what causes the longevity  gender gaps  remains one of the most fiercely debated puzzles among biologists and demographers  Historically   gender gaps  were claimed to stem from asymmetric inheritance of sex chromosomes or mitochondrial genomes leading to increased mutation load and reduced longevity in males  Alternatively  sex limited selection in either sex can result in the evolution of sexual dimorphism if there is substantial sex limited genetic variation in longevity  Here we use experimental evolution in roundworms  where males live longer than females  to show that both existence and magnitude of sex differences in longevity can depend exclusively on male limited evolution  By increasing male extrinsic mortality rate  we experimentally demonstrated evolution of sexual monomorphism in longevity in a sexually dimorphic animal  Remarkably  when extrinsic mortality was increased in a condition dependent manner  males evolved increased longevities thereby widening the  gender gap   These results challenge the key role of asymmetric inheritance theories for longevity  gender gaps  and firmly advance sex specific extrinsic mortalities as a primary evolutionary cause of intrinsic sex differences in longevity  
Helpful Allies or Suffocating Friends   Evolution in a Mutualism Constrains Adaptive Change  Mutualistic coevolution is vital to many species and has the potential to significantly alter the evolutionary trajectories of species  We tested the effects of evolution within a mutualism on the bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila by disassociating the mutualism between X  nematophila and the nematode  Steinernema carpocapsae  and experimentally evolving the bacteria either apart from the nematode or within the mutualism along with the nematode  Disassociated bacteria exhibited adaptation in response to selection  but the coevolved bacteria did not  Additionally  the disassociated bacteria evolved a phenotype that disrupted the mutualism upon reintroduction  Therefore  mutualistic coevolution imposed phenotypic restrictions and constrained rates of adaptation in the mutualistic bacteria relative to the disassociated bacteria  Thus  mutualistic coevolution can substantially alter the evolutionary trajectory of a population and constrain adaption in certain directions  
Causes of Rapid Divergence of Female Genital Morphology in Bahamas Mosquitofish  Gambusia hubbsi   The rapid divergence of male genital morphologies represents one of the most established trends in evolutionary biology  though understanding of the rate and mechanisms of female genital evolution are comparatively obscure  Three major mechanisms could lead to rapid genital divergence in females and result in patterns of correlated evolution with male genital morphologies   1  ecological variation that alters the context of sexual selection for both males and females   2  sexually antagonistic selection based on sexual conflict between sexes  and  3  selection against inter population mating  sometimes referred to as  lock and key     We conducted an empirical study investigating of the roles of these three non mutually exclusive mechanisms of rapid female genital divergence using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish  Gambusia hubbsi   Independent populations of these fish inhabit blue holes characterized by the presence or absence of a predator  We defined and measured 8 distinct female genital traits to assess variation in each across predation regime  We addressed male female genital coevolution by assessing correlations between trait divergence and genetic relatedness amongst population pairs  Our results show strong divergence in female genital morphology between the two predation regimes  with evidence of male female genital coevolution in one trait  the shape of female genital opening  We did not uncover any evidence in support of sexual conflict in driving patterns of correlated male female genital evolution  However  we found support for the third hypothesis  lock and key  based on evidence that the most highly related populations displayed the largest divergence in male and female genital traits  Altogether  this study reveals that both ecological variation and reinforcing selection favoring reproductive isolation underlies diversification patterns of female genitalia in Bahamas mosquitofish  
Genome evolution and transposable element dynamics in wild sunflower species  Transposable elements  TEs  are ubiquitous mobile DNA found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and in large part explain genome size variation in higher eukaryotes   The vast majority of repetitive DNA in plant genomes is derived from the proliferation of TEs  specifically class I long terminal repeat  LTR  retrotransposons  These elements are capable of proliferating in their host genome via a copy and paste mechanism and have achieved exceptionally high copy numbers in many plant lineages  Understanding the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of these sequences among different plant lineages is of considerable importance in the study of plant genomes and genome evolution   Modern DNA sequencing technologies combined with improvements in bioinformatic tools has facilitated studies of TE biology   Wild sunflower species in the genus Helianthus provide an excellent system for studying TE evolutionary dynamics in the context of genome size expansion and evolution  Genome sizes of 8 diploid sunflower species representing major lineages in the phylogeny  and an outgroup Phoebanthus species  have been determined by flow cytometry  genome sizes range from an estimated 6 9 to 24 2pg  Total genomic DNA of the 9 species under study was sequenced via an Illumina platform yielding approximately 0 2 to 0 6x coverage per species   Genome size was shown to correlate with estimated DNA repetitive fraction  p 0 0023 r 0 9005    Groups of related LTR retrotransposons were identified and their relative abundances among species determined using a graph based clustering algorithm   A reference panel of full length LTR retrotransposons mined from BAC data of the common sunflower Helianthus annuus was utilized to identify potential proliferative LTR retrotransposon lineages  This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining analysis of short read sequencing data with existing TE reference information to gain insights into TE evolutionary dynamics across species   
The evolution of phenotypic convergence in fishes of the lower Congo River  Phenotypic convergence provides powerful insight into how morphological diversity is shaped by selection  A striking instance of multi trait convergence is found across a broad phylogenetic spectrum of fishes endemic to the lower Congo River  LCR   a complex  high energy hydrological system characterized by some of the most extensive and powerful rapids on Earth  In this extreme selective environment  representatives of distantly related fish lineages have independently evolved complex suites of convergent traits including depigmentation  microphthalmia or eye loss  body depression with metameric increase  enhanced latero sensory anatomy  and hypertrophied jaw and branchial musculature  To better understand the evolution of these phenotypes  we developed a Bayesian molecular phylogenetic framework for one of the groups  spiny eels of the genus Mastacembelus  Our analysis demonstrates that depigmentation and microphthalmia have independently evolved multiple times in this genus  representing distinct colonizations of the LCR by both lacustrine and riverine lineages  Analysis of divergence times indicates these phenotypes arose within a narrow window  concurrent with newly available habitat in the LCR  This study represents one piece of a novel comparative framework for this newly discovered system  as we move toward the goal of understanding the evolutionary context of phenotypic convergence across multiple levels of biological organization  
Investigating parameterization in RAD tag phylogenetic inference  The advent of modern genomic  next generation sequencing  NGS  technologies offers the chance to unravel complex  hitherto obfuscated evolutionary and ecological patterns in non model organisms  However  a number of unresolved issues from a phylogenetics perspective mean that widely accepted methodologies for the implementation of these datasets are currently being heavily debated and are still in development  Among the issues  is whether there is value in employing standard methods of nucleotide sequence evolution modeling on the short sequence reads   90bp  generated across these huge datasets and whether the typical inclusion of large amounts of missing data across taxa when compiling sequence alignments for phylogenetic inference is problematic  Here we present an empirical investigation of the effects of these two issues placed against the backdrop of evaluating taxonomic relationships among a previously considered problematic species complex of yucca moths  Prodoxidae   Our main conclusion is that the huge volume of raw sequence information made available by RAD tag technologies means that the manipulation and parameterization of data in order to optimize Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference has minimal impact on final results  Taxonomic relationships among yucca moths were resolved unambiguously under different modeling schemes across all inferred phylogenies  almost always with 100  node support  Moreover  statistical comparison of pairwise branch length distances found that all phylogenies are of similar topological structure  We suggest that the large scale of NGS datasets means that many of the salient theoretical issues surrounding phylogenomic inference are of a different nature to those relevant to standard PCR based  multi gene phylogenetic reconstruction  
All venoms are not created equal  the distribution and adaptive significance of venom types in the Timber Rattlesnake  Crotalus horridus   Snake venom represents a polygenic  complex phenotype that possesses clear adaptive significance in feeding ecology  As such  venoms may be expected to vary across species and even within species  Somewhat surprisingly  however  it has been demonstrated that a few species have populations that vary from highly lethal  neurotoxic venoms  Type A  to less lethal  but tissue destroying  venoms  Type B   though relatively little is known about the geographic extent of this variation or its adaptive significance  We explore this variation in the Timber Rattlesnake  Crotalus horridus   a wide ranging species that is currently threatened or endangered in at least 11 U S  states and in Canada  We apply standard PCR techniques to test for the presence absence of the acidic and basic subunits of canebrake toxin  the type II phospholipase neurotoxin responsible for Type A venoms  throughout the range of C  horridus  We then use comparative transcriptomics and proteomics to characterize the venoms of a Type A population and a Type B population from less than 100 miles apart  Finally  we use mitochondrial sequencing and morphometrics to put the venom variation between these two populations into an adaptive context  We extend the known range of the medically important Type A venom and reveal previously undescribed variation correlated with the different venom types  which could impact current management strategies  
Intragenic epistasis on adaptive dynamics at the gene couch potato  Epistasis is a fundamental component of natural selection and adaptation in natural populations  It is not clear if the alleles that segregate in the wild act independently or if they associate to have non additive effects on fitness   Previous mapping in Drosophila melanogaster has identified that the couch potato gene is involved with climate adaptation by controlling the propensity to express a reproductive diapause needed to overwinter in temperate climates   A screen of clinal and seasonal wild populations of Drosophila identified multiple SNPs that vary predictably with climate   Three SNPs in the couch potato gene exhibit independent clines  however  certain multi SNP combinations vary non randomly with geographic location   This suggests that there are epistatic interactions between independent SNPs in the couch potato gene and these non additive interactions influence performance and fitness phenotypes that underlie adaptation to climate   Here  this hypothesis is tested using DGRP inbred lines to create seven populations that are each constant for one of the three SNP couch potato allele combinations to test these alleles in a randomized genetic background   The performance and fitness of these multi locus alleles is assessed using a comprehensive phenotypic screen  which includes assays for stress tolerance  fecundity  development  aging  body size  diapause  immunity  learning and behavior   There is significant variation for all traits investigated and epistasis is pervasive among SNPs for these traits   There are emergent properties associated with combinations of SNPs that lead to an adaptive pattern  the northern haplotype has non additive effects in traits associated with a cold climate life history strategy while traits involved with the warm weather life history syndrome are overexpressed for the southern haplotype  The changes in life history phenotypes correspond with differential expression patterns of cpo among the haplotypes   These epistatic interactions result in higher frequency of the northern and southern allele combinations in wild populations  demonstrating how emergent properties of combinations of SNPs underlie adaptive life history evolution in natural populations  
How does soil environment influence growth and reproduction in a serpentine plant  the past and the present  Environmental effects on pollen performance have the potential to influence both the reproductive success of individuals and the degree of interbreeding between populations because success during gametophytic competition is linked to pollen performance  Previous studies have found that assortative mating can be affected by edaphic characters through effects of soil nutrition on the pollen performance of plants from different populations and soil types   We studied the potential for serpentine soils to alter pollen performance and reproductive success of Mimulus guttatus growing on or off of serpentine soils   Using a hydroponic format in a greenhouse we manipulated the nutritional conditions of plants grown from seed collected from either serpentine or control soils in California   We measured the effects of seed source  serpentine  control  and growth environment  low versus high Ca Mg ratio  on plant growth  stem number and pollen performance   Plant biomass was highest for control plants grown in high Ca soils and for serpentine plants grown in low Ca soils  Pollen tube growth rates were higher for both types of plants when the female plant was grown in a high Ca environment suggesting a strong influence of maternal growth environment on pollen performance   As in the case of biomass  control plants improved more dramatically in high Ca styles compared to serpentine plants which had faster pollen tubes in low Ca styles relative to control plants  These results suggest that the success of ecotypes at gametophytic competition will be influenced by the growth environment of the female plant and competition could reinforce assortative mating in plants from different environments    
The Origin of South Asian Red Rice and Weed Competitiveness  Red rice  Oryza sativa  is an aggressive conspecific weed of cultivated rice  detrimental to rice agriculture systems worldwide  Previous research has suggested that the genetic background of red rice varies in different parts of the world  To account for this  various mechanisms for the origin of red rice have been proposed  including de domestication from local crops  evolution from local wild rice  and hybridization between cultivars and wild rice  Red rice accessions collected from various places of the world may have evolved to have similar phenotypes making them successful weeds  The evolution of similar weedy traits from different ancestors or mechanisms makes red rice an ideal system to study parallel evolution  Previous assessments of US red rice show that there are two distinct populations  the BHA and the SH  with genetic resemblance to aus and indica cultivars respectively  To date  there has been limited study of red rice populations that occur in South Asia  which is likely the center of domestication of the indica lineage of cultivated rice and also an area with high Oryza diversity  We characterized a panel of 186 accessions that includes South Asian weeds  US weeds  local wild rice  local cultivars of indica  aus and japonica varieties  and other Oryza outgroup species using Genotyping by Sequencing  GBS   Principle Component Analysis  PCA  and STRUCTURE analyses suggest that  1  there are multiple genetically differentiated groups in South Asian  with aus and some other local wild Oryza species contributing to South Asian red rice origins   2  US weeds resemble subgroups of South Asian red rice but may have descended directly from Asian cultivars  We subsequently assessed red rice seed morphology  awn  hull color and seed color  from multiple genetically differentiated groups and their potential cultivar ancestors  Morphology traits assessment suggests that  1  there is a correlation between phenotype and genetic origins   2  red rice is very different from its cultivated ancestors in terms of seed  weedy  traits  To investigate the possibility of selection leading to  weedy  trait occurrence  we applied Fst outlier tests to red rice subgroups and their cultivar ancestors  Loci that may be under selection or linked to loci under selection were detected from aus resembling red rice subgroup  Current efforts to understand the growth performance of red rice varieties and the physiological traits that contribute to weed competitiveness will be discussed   
The anti predatory behavioral repertoire of Drosophila melanogaster  Predation is among the major causes of mortality in most natural populations  Its importance as an agent of selection in shaping both morphology and behavior of prey populations can be inferred from the complexity and diversity of anti predator traits that organisms express  Although predation  as an agent of selection has been widely investigated  most studies lack tools to explore the genomic and developmental consequences of evolutionary response to predation  Drosophila melanogaster  a well characterized and tractable model organism with a large behavioral repertoire is well suited for this purpose  However  little is known about predation in D  melanogaster adults  As a starting point  we compiled a catalogue  or ethogram  of D  melanogaster s anti predatory behavioral repertoire in response to two visual  invertebrate predators  Salticus scenicus  zebra jumping spiders  and juvenile Tenodera aridifolia sinensis  praying mantids  that primarily differ in hunting mode  Based on behavioral observations of a wild caught population in the laboratory  we show that D  melanogaster can alter its behavior in a predator specific manner  Recognizing anti predatory behaviors that are persistent in natural populations is a prelude to understanding how these behaviors can evolve  To our knowledge  this is the first attempt at building an ethogram of D  melanogaster s anti predatory behaviors  
Is self pollination an evolutionary dead end  The evolution of mating systems in Erythranthe section Paradantha  Phrymaceae   Erythranthe section Paradantha  Phrymaceae  has a tremendous amount of floral diversity among a small number of closely related species  The section includes species that exhibit bicolored floral patterns  flower color polymorphisms  and variation in corolla size  degree of herkogamy  and nectar guide patterns  Twelve species included in the study have large showy flowers that have strong bilateral symmetry  complex nectar guide patterns  and are inferred to be primarily outcrossing  Four species included in the study are inferred to be primarily self pollinating based on flowering time  size of reproductive parts  flower duration  and observations of self pollination  These four putatively self pollinating species  Erythranthe androsacea  E  calcicola  E  rubella  and E  suksdorfii  have relatively large range sizes when compared with the remaining taxa included in the study  In this study I expand previous sampling  and utilize sequence data from nuclear ribosomal ITS and three non coding regions from the chloroplast genome  petA psbJ  psbD trnT  rpl32 trnL  to examine the evolution of mating systems and its implications on diversification and range size for species in Erythranthe section Paradantha   
Water availability influences reproductive output between sexes in two divergent Silene latifolia populations  Local adaptation is a widespread phenomenon and is thought to be important in maintaining genetic variation within species   Silene latifolia is an herbaceous flowering plant that shows extreme phenotypic variation across its native European range   This species is also dioecious  separate male and female individuals   and many traits are sexually dimorphic   As such  S  latifolia provides a novel approach to local adaptation studies because the sexes may be under differing selection across varying habitats   We completed a common garden experiment between two divergent populations of S  latifolia from Spain and Croatia that differ considerably in life history  floral morphology  and functional leaf traits   These common garden studies suggest that the phenotypic differences seen in the field likely have a genetic basis   The two habitats of origin also vary markedly in rainfall and temperature   To address the importance of precipitation differences as a possible selective agent in the native habitats  we completed a water manipulation experiment that tracked plant performance over multiple flowering seasons   While both sexes exhibited reduced reproductive output under limited water regimens  the reduction was more severe for males   Individuals originating from the wetter habitat  Croatia  also showed a more severe decrease in reproductive output in restricted water conditions than individuals originating from the dry habitat  Spain    These results suggest that water availability likely acts as an important selective agent in the natural habitat  and these findings will allow us to make predictions about traits that are important in local adaptation and the selective forces that drive divergence  
The Unbearable Lifespan of Beings  A Revision to the Evolutionary Theory of Ageing  Drosophila repeatedly reared on a short lifecycle for three decades show no detectable decline in lifespan  contrary to the predictions of the evolutionary theory of ageing  Genetic variation conforming to extant theory  antagonistic pleiotropy  mutation accumulation  may be lacking  but this is not supported by multiple experimental analyses  Using experimental mutation accumulation in early life  we show that selection against harmful mutations has life extending effects approximately eight times beyond the age of reproduction enforced in lab culture  These data suggest severe constraint on the evolution of longevity imposed by positive pleiotropy  The Evolutionary Theory of Ageing has not given much weight to the importance of positive pleiotropy  limiting its ability to explain the lifespan of organisms  
Evolution of devil facial tumor disease  what it means for the survival of the Tasmanian devil  Tasmanian devils are the world s largest living carnivorous marsupials  They have experienced a turbulent history  becoming extinct on mainland Australia and surviving a couple of previous population crashes in Tasmania  However  it is right now that devils are perhaps fighting their toughest battle as they contend with an unusual contagious cancer  This fatal cancer  known as devil facial tumor  DFT  disease  is threatening the devil population with extinction  DFT disease appears to have arisen in a female devil in the mid 1990s  It is the tumor itself that is the infectious agent  having since spread through much of the population when devils bite each other and causing a dramatic drop in devil numbers across much of Tasmania  The only other example of a transmissible tumor in the wild is canine transmissible venereal tumor  CTVT   which has been spreading through dogs for over 1000 years  The most important difference between DFT and CTVT is that in most cases CTVT does not kill its host  with the tumor and host being able to co exist in the population  Is there a chance that DFT could evolve to reach this more desirable scenario    The initial DFT appears to have resulted from a shattering and rejoining of two chromosomes  followed by the accumulation of other structural mutations which resulted in the formation of several distinctive DFT marker chromosomes  Interestingly  these regions are not only extensively rearranged in DFTs but are also highly rearranged between different marsupial species  suggesting a potential link between tumor and evolutionary breakpoints  By studying DFT chromosomes isolated from individuals from different geographical locations  it has been possible to trace the evolution of this tumor as it ispreads through the population  Until recently  structural mutations in DFTs were seemingly restricted to particular genomic regions  predominantly regions consisting of chromosome 4  5 and X material but a more recent karyotypic strain of the DFT with a duplication of chromosome 1 material has been detected in a population where DFT disease prevalence is reduced and there has been a limited effect on population structure compared to other areas affected by DFT disease  The implications of this relatively major chromosomal change on the impact of DFT disease will be discussed    
How does pollination mutualism affect the evolution of prior self fertilization  A model  The mode of pollination is often neglected regarding the evolution of selfing  Yet the distribution of mating systems seems to depend on the mode of pollination  and pollinators are likely to interfere with selfing evolution  since they can cause strong selective pressures on floral traits  Most selfing species reduce their investment in reproduction  and display smaller flowers  with less nectar and scents  referred to as selfing syndrome   We model the evolution of prior selfing when selfing rate affects both the demography of plants and pollinators and the investment of plants in pollination  Including the selfing syndrome in the model allows to predict several outcomes  According to inbreeding depression and selfing syndrome kinetic  plants can evolve either towards complete outcrossing  complete selfing  or to a stable mixed mating system  even when inbreeding depression is high  We predict that the evolution to high selfing rates could lead to evolutionary suicides  highlighting the importance of merging demography and evolution in models  The consequence of the selfing syndrome on plant pollinator interactions could be a widespread mechanism driving the evolution of selfing in animal pollinated taxa  
The plastomes of mycoheterotrophic Ericaceae exhibit extensive gene loss and rearrangements  Heterotrophic plants show a wide range of evolutionary degradation of photosynthetic ability and rely entirely or partially on their hosts to supply water and nutrients  These plants are divided into two distinct  but evolutionary artificial groups  parasitic and mycoheterotrophic plants  Haustorial parasitism has evolved at least 11 times independently and there are at least 10 independent origins of mycoheterotrophy in angiosperms  Ericaceae  the heather family  is a large and diverse group of plants with elaborate symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi  including several mycoheterotrophic lineages  Based on previous hybridization results  the plastomes of 10 representative Ericaceae species with different life histories and trophic levels  including multiple representatives from the hemi mycoheterotrophic pyroloids and holo mycoheterotrophic monotropoids were sequenced using a nextgen sequencing approach  Illumina   Our results indicate that rearrangements of the large single copy region as well as expansion and contraction of the inverted repeat regions of the plastome are typical for most member of Ericaceae  Both non synonymous  Ka  and synonymous substitution  Ks  rates were evaluated to determine if a relaxation of the plastid genes occurred prior to the transition to mycoheterotophy  a pattern that has been observed in parasitic plant lineages  The plastomes of monotropoids exhibit extensive loss of genes relating to photosynthetic function and retain genes with possible function outside photosynthesis  Furthermore  hemi mycoheterotrophic plants retain most genes relating to photosynthesis but are polymorphic for the presence of the plastid ndh  genes  Our results extend previous inferences that plastid gene losses occur prior to becoming holo heterotrophic and that mycoheterotrophic Ericaceae exhibit gene loss similar in pattern to parasitic plants  
 The impact of breeding protocol on inbreeding  genetic diversity  and adaptation to captivity as measured in experimental populations of deer mice   The goals of captive breeding programs are often to prevent extinction and or extirpation while maintaining genetic diversity and fitness until reintroductions or supplementation of wild populations can occur   However  due to genetic changes that occur in captive populations  approximately one third of such conservation programs fail to successfully establish new populations or contribute genes to existing populations   We evaluated such genetic changes in captive populations using pedigree information  neutral microsatellite loci that should reflect evolution due to drift and inbreeding  and sequence from the d loop portion of the mitochondrial genome   We bred six populations of white footed mice  Peromyscus leucopus  for 20 generations using two replicates of three protocols   minimizing mean kinship  MMK   random mating  RAN   or selection for docility  DOC    After 20 generations  inbreeding  as measured by the pedigree  increased in all 6 captive populations  and was strongest in the first few generations  We found that MMK resulted in the slowest rate of loss of genetic diversity whereas the RAN and DOC protocols resulted in a more rapid loss of genetic diversity  with more variance across replicate populations    At the end of the captive program  the MK populations retained  60  of the allelic diversity found in the source population compared to 48  and 45  in the RAN and DOC protocols  respectively   By comparing simulated populations to empirical data  we found evidence for adaptation to captivity via genetic hitchhiking of neutral microsatellites to nearby genes under selection  although these results varied by breeding protocol   Our results suggest that MMK reduces the loss of alleles due to drift  inbreeding  and selection more effectively than random mating or docility selection  and thus MMK should be the gold standard breeding protocol for threatened and endangered species reared in captivity  
A new test for positive selection with greatly improved power  Finding positive selected genes  or sites in genes  is a key question in biology  A variety of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for testing for positive selection using omega  the ratio of the fixation rates of non synonymous and synonymous mutations  have been developed  These are all very conservative when applied to real genes  and hence achieve a lower power than desired   One of these tests  embodied in the SLR method  Massingham and Goldman  2005   estimates the maximum likelihood value of omega for each site  and then tests whether this value is greater than one  This test is conservative because the null hypothesis assumes that all sites are either neutral or positively selected  omega >  1   whereas in reality the majority of sites in genes are under purifying selection  omega   I will present a new method to test for positive selection that has greatly improved power whilst retaining control of the false positive rate  This involves a new site wise likelihood ratio test  designed to have power and control when many of the sites in the gene are under purifying selection  as is typically the case   and a diagnostic for detecting certain situations in which the original SLR test should be preferred  The new test obtains improved power by fitting the null hypothesis to the data and then performing parametric bootstraps   The method has been tested using simulations over a wide range of realistic conditions  including standard comparisons used in previous studies  and larger and more realistic examples modeled on real life studies  I will show that  for those rare cases where all sites are either strictly neutral  omega 1  or positively selected  omega>1   the new method performs as well as SLR   More importantly  for genes where many of the sites are conserved  this method has much better power than other tests and a controlled false positive rate  
Skull phenotypic evolution and its relationship with speciation across extant bats  Diversity is unevenly distributed across the tree of life  without regards to scale  clades can be highly speciose or species poor  have high disparity or be morphologically conserved  and be ecologically diverse or ecologically constrained  These patterns are produced by variable rates and types of evolution  thereby intertwining processes of diversification  phenotypic evolution  and adaptation  Understanding how these different processes are related  then  and the possible causes of rate variability has become a central issue in the field of macroevolution  Here  we present an analysis on diversification and phenotypic evolution in bats  a highly speciose clade with strong ties between ecologically diversity and morphological disparity  We focus on the evolution of the skull  considering its strong ties to feeding ecology and behavior across bats  Our analyses are based on the BAMM platform  a Bayesian rjMCMC program for modeling macroevolutionary dynamics of diversification and phenotypic evolution  Though we find evidence for family level variability in both rates of diversification and phenotypic evolution  they are not well correlated  and sometimes associate inversely  As such  we hypothesize that bursts of bat speciation have not always been associated with rapid phenotypic evolution  as predicted by classical models of adaptive radiations  
Comparative genomics sheds light on the evolution and function of the Highly Iterative Palindrome  1 motif in Cyanobacteria  The Highly Iterative Palindrome 1  HIP1   an octamer palindromic motif  GTCATCGC   is highly abundant in a wide range of cyanobacterial genomes from various habitats  HIP1 frequency can be as high as one occurrence per 350 nucleotides  which is rather astonishing considering that at this frequency  on average  every gene in that genome will be associated with more than one HIP1 motif   HIP1 was first identified in the early 1990s  yet its functional and molecular roles are still not understood  No mechanism or biological system has been identified that explains this level of prevalence  More discouraging  it is still not clear whether HIP1 has a function  or whether HIP1 abundance is an artifact of some neutral process  such as DNA repair or transposition   Here we present results from genome scale analyses that provide the first evidence that HIP1 motifs are under selection  which further demonstrates that HIP1 motifs are functional  We estimate the expected HIP1motif frequency  taking into account the background tri nucleotide frequency in the genome  and showed that observed HIP1 frequencies are as much as 100 times higher than expected   This HIP1 motif enrichment is observed in both coding and non coding regions  Analyses of alignments of genomes with Ks values ranging from 0 02 to 0 59 further showed HIP1 motif conservation in homologous sequences  The level of HIP1 conservation is significantly higher than the conservation of control motifs  i e    other octamer palindromes with the same GC content  To show that such conservation is not merely a result of codon usage  we demonstrated that codons in HIP1 motifs are more conserved than the same codons found outside HIP1 motifs  Our results  taken together  are consistent with the hypothesis that HIP1 motifs are under selection  which proves that the abundance of HIP1 motifs is related to biological functions  rather than to some neutral process   
The organization and evolution of the Responder satellite in the Drosophila melanogaster group  dynamic evolution of a target of meiotic drive  Satellite DNA can make up a substantial fraction of eukaryotic genomes and has roles in genome structure and chromosome segregation   The rapid evolution of satellite DNA can contribute to genomic instability and genetic incompatibilities between species  Despite its ubiquity and its contribution to genome evolution  we currently know little about the dynamics of satellite DNA evolution  The Responder  Rsp  satellite DNA family is found in the pericentric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster  Rsp is well known for being the target of Segregation Distorter  SD   an autosomal meiotic drive system in D  melanogaster   I present an evolutionary genetic analysis of the Rsp family of repeats in species of the melanogaster subgroup using a combination of available BAC sequences  whole genome shotgun Sanger reads  Illumina short read deep sequencing  and fluorescence in situ hybridization  I show that Rsp repeats have euchromatic locations throughout the genome  that Rsp arrays show evidence for concerted evolution  and that Rsp repeats exist outside of D  melanogaster  in species of the simulans clade  The repeats in these species are considerably diverged at the sequence level compared to D  melanogaster  and have a strikingly different genomic distribution  Thus  the evolution of the Rsp family is highly dynamic over a short evolutionary time scale   
Wallace under scrutiny  role of the fluvial barriers in the diversification of  Amazonian Amphibians  The Amazon region harbors the most speciose communities on Earth and yet the processes that originated that diversity are poorly understood   One of the oldest hypotheses to explain Amazon diversity is the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis  which postulates that the large rivers of the Amazon basin have acted as barriers to gene flow  promoting genetic differentiation and  as a result  speciation  We tested the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis in amphibians by analyzing genetic differentiation in nine amphibian species sampled along 200 km of the Napo River in Amazonian Ecuador  Samples were collected on both banks of the river at 20 km intervals  We also included samples collected up to 100 km away from the banks  Between one and four mitochondrial genes were sequenced per species  Phylogenetic trees were obtained under the maximum likelihood optimality criterion and a parametric bootstrap test was applied on each species to test the hypothesis of reciprocal monophyly between banks of the river  In eight out of nine species  our results show lack of support for the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis  i e   opposite banks of the river are genetically similar and are not monophyletic   However  we found strong and statistically significant differentiation between banks in the treefrog Hypsiboas cinerascens  In conclusion  our results indicate that large rivers have played a minor role in the diversification of Amazonian amphibians  However  a small proportion of species may have formed by the vicariant effect of Riverine Barriers    
Can intralocus sexual conflict explain the maintenance of alternative reproductive tactics   Intralocus sexual conflict  IASC  arises when fitness optima for a shared trait differ between the sexes  such conflict may help maintain genetic variation within populations  Sex limited expression of sexually antagonistic traits may help resolve the conflict  but the extent of this resolution remains a subject of debate  In species with alternative male reproductive tactics  unresolved conflict should manifest more in a more sexually dimorphic male phenotype  We tested this prediction in the bulb mite  Rhizoglyphus robini   a species in which aggressive fighters  which possess sharply terminated and thickened legs used to combat other males  coexist with benign scramblers  which have unmodified  female like legs   To do this  we established  replicated lines in which we increased the proportion of each of the alternative male morphs using artificial selection  After approximately 40 generations  the proportion of fighters and scramblers stabilized at >0 9 in fighter  and scrambler selected lines  respectively  We then measured several female fitness components  As predicted by IASC theory  female fecundity and longevity was lower in lines selected for fighters and higher in lines selected for scramblers  This finding indicates that sexually selected phenotypes are associated with an ontogenetic conflict that is not easily resolved  Furthermore  we suggest that IASC may be an important mechanism contributing to the maintenance of genetic variation in the expression of alternative reproductive tactics  
Transfer of Non coding DNA Drives Regulatory Rewiring in Bacteria  The rapid pace of evolution in bacteria is widely attributed to the promiscuous transfer and recombination of protein coding genes  However  it is not known whether the same forces also drive the evolution of non coding regulatory regions  Through the analysis of 270 000 regulatory regions across 247 bacterial genomes  we demonstrate that regulatory  switching  to non homologous alternatives is ubiquitous  occurring across the bacterial domain  Using comparative transcriptomics  we show that at least 16  of the expression divergence between E  coli strains can be explained by this regulatory switching  Among other mechanisms  we found that switching can occur through horizontal transfer of regulatory regions  We experimentally show that regulatory transfer facilitates rapid phenotypic diversification of a human pathogen  This regulatory mobility enables bacterial genes to access a vast pool of potential regulatory elements  facilitating efficient exploration of the regulatory landscape   
Predator induced phenotypic plasticity within  and across generations  Much work has shown that the environment can induce phenotypic changes that span multiple generations   Theory predicts that similar conditions  i e   predictable environmental variation  favor the evolution of within  and across generation plasticity   We explored the relationship between within  versus across generation plasticity by evaluating the influence of predator cues on the life history traits of Daphnia ambigua   We manipulated the duration of exposure to fish conditioned water and tracked responses across multiple generations   We show that predator exposure during embryonic development causes faster development and increased reproductive output   Such effects are detectable two generations removed from predator exposure  Most importantly  we found a negative correlation between within  vs  across generation responses   Although many models address transgenerational plasticity  none of them predict all features of this work  Our results highlight the need to refine the theory of transgenerational plasticity        
Islands as Venues For Homoploid Hybrid Speciation  A Case For The Endangered Hawaiian Duck  Speciation is regarded primarily as a bifurcation from an ancestral species resulting in two distinct taxonomic units  Although hybrid speciation is known to occur  such events have been regarded as rare in homoploid systems  Here  we provide several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the endangered Hawaiian duck  Anas wyvilliana  is descended from ancient hybridization between the mallard  A  platyrhynchos  and Laysan duck  A  laysanensis   Specifically  using coalescent methods  we reveal that gene flow from either of the putative parental species is necessary to explain the diversity and apparent genomic mosaic within the Hawaiian duck  We discuss how island systems might act as arenas for interspecific hybridization leading to speciation as a result of rapid isolation between hybrids and parental species  Hybrid speciation may be a more common mechanism than previously thought for generating biodiversity  especially during rapid radiations  
Speciation Genomics and a Role for the Sex Chromosome in the Mallard and Mexican Duck  Speciation is a continuous and dynamic process  Early in speciation  the genomes of incipient taxa are manipulated by evolutionary forces  and identifying their heterogeneous composition can reveal potentially important processes influencing species composition  We conducted genomic scans across the mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA  control region  3563 autosomal loci  and 172 Z chromosome loci in the mallard  Anas platyrhynchos  N   17 individuals  and Mexican duck  A   p   diazi  N   105 individuals from six Mexican and two US states  to disentangle their incipient evolutionary relationship  Between mallards and Mexican ducks  we found discordance in divergence estimates among autosomal  mean  ST   0 018   sex linked  mean  ST   0 086   and mtDNA   ST   0 14  markers  and five Z loci and one autosomal locus were more divergent than expected given background levels of divergence  In contrast  divergence in autosomal  mean  ST   0 012  and Z linked markers  mean  ST   0 018  were tightly correlated within Mexican ducks  and divergence at only two autosomal loci strongly deviated from background levels  We conclude that speciation between mallards and Mexican ducks is likely proceeding via selection on a few sex linked markers with large effects  whereas divergence at the remaining genome is the result of genetic drift  These results suggest post zygotic isolating mechanisms  In contrast  divergence among Mexican duck populations is consistent with isolation by distance and large role for genetic drift  These results demonstrate that a large number of loci are necessary to better understand the speciation process between recently diverged taxa and provides a compelling example of the differential roles of selection and genetic drift across genomic regions  
Investigating modes of speciation in trans Isthmian fishes  Traditionally  geminate taxon pairs are thought to arise through allopatry when a geographic barrier emerges  bisecting a taxon s geographic range and preventing gene flow between the now separated populations  However  incipient parapatric speciation prior to final barrier emergence is also possible  In the case of the former scenario  one may expect the ecological niche tolerances of geminate species to be conserved  whereas in the latter  niche tolerance divergence is expected to be correlated with genetic divergence  Grunts in the family Haemulidae present a possible example of pre isolation speciation  evidence from previous studies have suggested possible non simultaneous divergence in four marine geminate pairs separated by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama  To investigate this idea  I pursued two lines of inquiry  First  I developed ecological niche models for each of the eight taxa by integrating locality data from several observational and specimen databases with ecological data from the World Ocean Atlas  The resulting models were then projected into their sister taxon s geographic range  and the power to accurately predict observations of the sister taxon was assessed  Second  I measured similarity between modeled ecological niche tolerances of geminate taxa and calculated the degree to which niche divergence and genetic divergence were correlated  Generally  niche models of one taxon did not accurately predict its geminate  and niche and genetic divergence were correlated  While equivocal  my results suggest that speciation in haemulid geminate pairs may have begun parapatrically prior to final isolation by the completion of the Isthmus of Panama  
Disentangling phylogenetic relationships complicated by polyploidy in the genus Phlox  Polemoniaceae   Phlox  the largest genus among Polemoniaceae  exhibits intriguing diversity among its ca  60 mostly North American species  The genus shows evidence of complicated evolutionary processes at low  intra  and interspecific  taxonomic levels  which has made reconstructing relationships among species quite difficult  Of particular interest are patterns of variation in ploidy level among and within species  Here we discuss general patterns of congruence and incongruence between ITS and cpDNA phylogenies based on comprehensive sampling of Phlox taxa  Incorporating ploidy level information for samples  we demonstrate that phylogenies that exclude polyploid samples show better agreement  These diploid sample phylogenies are discussed in light of current taxonomy  highlighting placement of taxonomic groups of interest  including the upright eastern taxa  western edaphic endemics  upright southwestern taxa  eastern mat forming taxa  annuals  and diploid members of the P  hoodii and P  longifolia complexes  We further present available phylogenetic data for several low copy regions  which improve resolution of relationships for the genus  Several examples of diploid and polyploid taxa are highlighted and considered in the context of all data sets  We discuss challenges to reconstructing relationships for groups with extensive polyploidy  as well as some strategies for obtaining sufficient sequence data in light of potential allelic variation  This study provides an improved phylogenetic framework for Phlox  advancing it as an excellent system for investigating aspects of diversity relative to polyploidy  
 Environmental stability  niche conservatism  and energetic constraints  explaining tropical biodiversity   Many different hypotheses have been suggested to explain why there are more species at tropical versus temperate latitudes  Among these are  1  the   species energy hypothesis    in which species richness is a function of the energy or resources available in the environment   2  the   tropical conservatism hypothesis    in which a tropical clade origin combined with highly conserved thermal niches results in fewer species dispersing away from the tropics with less time for diversification  and  3  the   tropical stability hypothesis    in which temperate regions have fewer species because of repeated extinction events related to global climate cycles  We use a novel eco evolutionary simulation model to identify the spatial  temporal  and phylogenetic secondary patterns that might be diagnostic of these three hypotheses  The patterns examined include metrics of tree shape  acceleration or deceleration in branching events  imbalance  and how measures such as mean root distance and phylogenetic species variability vary across the latitudinal gradient  Empirical patterns of mammals in the New World are interpreted in the context of simulation results  
Sex specific changes in allometric scaling of a sexually selected trait due to a novel host shift  The emergence of novel insect plant interactions is a common phenomenon in most current ecological landscapes  Despite the interest of evolutionary biologists and ecologists on these interactions  very few studies have evaluated the effects of novel host shifts on sexual selection dynamics of native insects  Male sexually selected weapons often exhibit heightened condition dependence  which makes these structures particularly sensitive to environmental change  Here we examined the effects of a novel host on a native insect s phenotype  specifically the allometry of a sexually selected trait  The males of the sexually dimorphic heliconia bug  Leptoscelis tricolor  possess enlarge hind femurs used in male male contests  These hind femurs also exhibit positive allometry   a disproportionate larger size on bigger individuals  In the wild the size and scaling relationship of these weapons is affected by native host plant species and their phenological state  In recent years the heliconia bug has begun using an exotic Heliconia species as host  Our results reveal that overall size and hind femur size were not affected by novel host use for either sex  but the allometric scaling of these two traits changed in distinct ways for each sex  In males  the allometric slope did do not change  but the Y intercept was lowered by the novel host  In other words  for any given body size  males that developed on the novel host had smaller hind femurs than those males that developed on either native Heliconia species  In the case of females  the novel host caused the development of a negative allometric slope for hind femur size  instead of the expected isometric allometry obtained under natural conditions  This happened because smaller adult females exhibited disproportionately larger hind femurs than bigger females  Our study reveals that a novel host causes significant changes in the phenotypic expression of sexual traits  The novel host could be having major consequences on the sexual selection dynamics in this population  not only by producing males with relatively smaller weapons but by disrupting resource allocation in females  It is important to identify the effects of species introductions on the processes involved in sexual selection in wild populations  These recently altered settings not only provide great opportunities to study the evolutionary consequences of host shifts  but also carry vast conservation implications due to the prevalence of species introductions globally  
Phylogenetics of polyploid African clawed frogs using RNAseq  inferences for sex chromosome evolution  Classical theory dictates that  after establishment  sex chromosomes will begin to diverge from one another  However  it has become evident in recent years that non diverged   homomorphic   sex chromosomes are quite common in nature  perhaps more so than heteromorphic sex chromosomes  Amphibians represent an interesting model for studying sex chromosome evolution because  unlike mammals  the sex determining regions or genetic triggers have changed dozens of times  and sex chromosomes tend to be minimally diverged with genetic recombination occurring over most of their length  This turnover of sex chromosomes allows for the study of evolutionary forces acting on sex chromosomes after their establishment  and can illuminate why some sex chromosomes diverged quickly while other appear not to diverge much at all  Within the African clawed frog lineage  Xenopus and Silurana   there has been at least one turnover of the sex chromosomes  as most species in the Xenopus genus have one sex determining system  based on DM W  and species in the Silurana genus have another  non homologous system  In addition to that  the species X  borealis appears to have another system  not homologous to either  In an effort to explore and characterize this third system  unique to X  borealis  we first reconstructed the phylogeny of Xenopus as  to date  many nodes are unresolved  Using whole transcriptome sequencing for 5 individuals  representing the major Xenopus clades  we designed an analysis pipeline to ensure that only orthologous comparisons are made following de novo transcriptome assembly  as these species are all tetraploid and lack a high quality genome to map to  and have conducted Bayesian phylogenetic analysis  One possibility is that X  borealis has retained the ancestral sex determining chromosomes  sharing homology with the Silurana sex determining system  Using an F1 cross  we assess inheritance of parental polymorphisms of genomic regions that are sex linked in S  tropicalis  All analysis so far indicates that X  borealis has a novel  evolutionarily young  sex determining system  implying that there has been a third turnover of sex chromosomes within this group  Future work will aim to directly characterize the sex chromosomes in this species  Broader implications include furthering our understanding of the evolutionary history of the only known master sex determining gene in Amphibians  DM W  and contribute to the understanding of how divergent evolution occurs in tightly regulated genetic systems  
Patterns of malaria transmission may affect sex ratio evolution  Malaria parasites have distinct male and female forms  and their sex ratios tend to be female biased and show considerable variation among species  among infections within a species and within infections over time  An explanation for this variation should emerge from sex ratio theory  a focus in evolutionary biology that explores how selection shapes the ratios of males to females  Specifically  Hamilton s Local Mate Competition  LMC  model has been emphasized because its assumptions match well the distribution of malaria parasites among hosts and it predicts female biased sex ratios that vary based on the number of genetic lineages present in a host  However  this model assumes a linear relationship between the number of females produced in a host and the number of offspring in the next generation  which may not be accurate for malaria parasites due to their transmission biology  Instead  producing an increasingly greater number of females may have diminishing returns  I developed a mathematical model that incorporates this modified relationship and I explore the implications for sex ratio evolution  In particular  I highlight trends that are predicted by the new model that are not expected under LMC  I then present new data and review existing data relating to these divergent trends  While much of the data on malaria parasite sex ratios is qualitative and consistent with either model  some data  especially those comparing among species  show trends consistent with the new model that are not predicted by LMC   
Life History and Behavior in a Primate Hybrid Zone  Hybridization in nature has potentially profound effects on evolutionary processes  it can create either evolutionary dead ends or evolutionary opportunities for the organisms experiencing it  Recent studies of hybridization have been enhanced by the advent of genetic marker based techniques for inferring the degree of admixture occurring within individuals  We conducted a genetic marker based analysis of hybridization in a large bodied  long lived mammal over multiple generations  Specifically  we analyzed patterns of hybridization between yellow baboons  Papio cynocephalus  and anubis baboons  P  anubis  in a well studied natural population in Amboseli National Park  Kenya  using genetic samples from more than 700 individuals born over 40 years  We assigned genetic hybrid scores based on genotypes at 14 microsatellite loci using the clustering algorithm implemented in Structure 2 0  and assessed the robustness of these scores by comparison to pedigree information and through simulation   The proportion of hybrids in the Amboseli population has grown over time  but the average proportion of anubis ancestry within hybrids is gradually decreasing   We found that both dispersal and maturation occurred earlier in individual male baboons that were more admixed  Hybrid females  too  reached menarche slightly earlier than non hybrid females  but maternal dominance rank and the presence of maternal relatives had larger effects on female maturation than genetic background  We also identified novel effects of genetic background on mating patterns  including a mating advantage for admixed males  and weakly assortative mating among both yellow like and anubis like pairs  These genetic effects acted alongside behavioral and demographic effects to produce highly nonrandom mating patterns  Our results suggest that this population may be undergoing admixture related evolutionary change  driven in part by life history differences between yellow and hybrid individuals  and in part by nonrandom mating driven by differences in genetic background  
 Assessing the Intraspecific Systematics of the Cotton Mouse  Peromyscus gossypinus  Using A Highly Variable Region of the Mitochondrial Genome   High morphological plasticity within and among species presents an ongoing challenge to the identification of taxonomic units  This is particularly true in generalist rodent species where plasticity is the norm  not the exception  One such species  the cotton mouse  Peromyscus gossypinus  consists of five extant  morphologically identified subspecies  Studies of morphological and allozyme variation have suggested these may not represent distinct taxonomic units  This study applied DNA sequencing technology to assess the taxonomic status of extant subspecies of P  gossypinus and elucidate the species  intraspecific phylogeny  The D loop of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced in 527 organisms from throughout the species range including all known insular populations  Phylogenetic reconstructions  genetic distances  and analysis of molecular variance were performed on the resulting data  Results were compared to currently recognized subspecies to identify congruence and assess taxonomic validity  Reconstructions identify three primary clades within P  gossypinus with varying support and do not correspond to the current taxonomy  Within clades several insular populations are distinct  indicating a lack of gene flow with mainland populations  Finally  results indicate a pattern of diversity that corresponds with historic biogeographic events  These results suggest the need to overhaul the current intraspecific systematics of P  gossypinus  Keywords  Systematics  Phylogeography  Intraspecific  Peromyscus 
Ribozyme plasticity and molecular trade offs can account for increasing complexity and network stability at the origin of life   In the RNA world hypothesis large ribozymes capable of enzymatic functions like polymerization and recombination were essential for life to begin  However  a knowledge of how complex ribozymes emerged from simple oligomers   
Estimating uncertainty in multivariate responses to selection  Predicting the responses to natural selection is one of the key goals of evolutionary biology  Two of the challenges in fulfilling this goal have been the realization that many estimates of natural selection might be highly biased by environmentally induced covariances between traits and fitness  and that many estimated responses to selection do not incorporate or report uncertainty in the estimates  Here we describe the application of a framework that blends the merits of the Robertson Price Identity approach and the multivariate breeders equation to address these challenges  The approach allows genetic covariance matrices  selection differentials  selection gradients  and responses to selection to be estimated without environmentally induced bias  direct and indirect selection and responses to selection to be distinguished  and if implemented in a Bayesian MCMC framework  statistically robust estimates of uncertainty on all of these parameters to be made  We illustrate our approach with a worked example of previously published data  More generally  we suggest that applying both the Robertson Price Identity and the multivariate breeders equation will facilitate hypothesis testing about natural selection  genetic constraints  and evolutionary responses  
The evolution of functional trait syndromes  the ecological genetics of drought resistance in annual monkeyflowers   Complex  multi trait adaptations that repeatedly evolve through convergent responses to a single agent of selection are functional trait syndromes  The optimized evolution of these syndromes may be limited by evolutionary  genetic or biophysical tradeoffs that impede the evolution of certain character state combinations  We have investigated whether genetic correlations constrain the evolution of functional trait syndromes in response to drought stress  Plants adapt to drought stress through multiple physiological mechanisms including rapid reproduction  drought escape  and or resisting drought conditions  drought avoidance   In theory  plants that flower early but can also maintain reproductive output as long as possible after the onset of drought will have the highest fitness   However  drought escape and drought avoidance are considered mutually exclusive because of the accompanying resource allocation tradeoffs  Through common garden and photoperiod response experiments  we assessed drought escape and drought avoidance traits in annual populations of the common monkeyflower  Mimulus guttatus  sampled across ten altitudinal transects in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mt  ranges  Our findings indicate that M  guttatus has repeatedly evolved both drought escape and drought avoidance strategies in populations with drought abbreviated growing seasons  These strategies evolve primarily as independent syndromes  with negative genetic covariance between traits associated with each syndrome  However  in some populations with the short growing seasons  drought escape and drought avoidance traits coincide  suggesting a unified syndrome can evolve in the correct environmental conditions  Our findings highlight the diverse functional responses populations take to adapt to similar conditions and demonstrate evolutionary flexibility in the formation of functional trait syndromes  
Does religion or education matter more when predicting university students  understanding of evolution   There is much opposition to evolution in the public sphere  especially in America  The strong and negative correlation between belief in a god and acceptance of evolution across the world suggests that religiosity may drive some of the resistance to evolution  There is also clear evidence that as scientific education increases  acceptance of evolution increases and religiosity decreases  this has been shown at the individual  state  and country levels  However  little is know about college students  views on evolution  We used a 34 question survey of 2 999 students at a major research institution in the Deep South to assess how education and religion impact knowledge and acceptance of evolution  Using Structural Equation Modeling  SEM  we show that religiosity is strongly and negatively correlated with the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution  MATE  scores  Academic level  major  science vs  non science   and high school education are positively correlated with the MATE scores but much less important in the overall model than religion  We also find that if students were taught creationism or creationism and evolution in high school  their MATE scores as seniors are significantly lower than those students who were taught nothing  We also surveyed three different biology courses to determine Pre  and Post class MATE scores  and we find that MATE scores do improve with instruction but that improvement depends on the degree of religiosity  Students who seldom never attend church were the ones that had the highest MATE scores and the most improvement  We discuss these results in relation to other studies and geographic regions  and we reflect on what this means for improving science education     
Understanding epistasis and gene networks in complex traits  An analysis of aggression in a model system  Most animals display aggressive behavior to secure food resources  protect against predators and facilitate access to mating partners  Inappropriate or excessive aggression has detrimental consequences for an individual  which can lead to lower fitness  Aggressive behavior is genetically complex  influenced by many genes as well as interactions with the environment  However  the genetic pathways affecting variation in aggressive behavior are evolutionarily conserved  enabling general inferences to be drawn from genetic analysis using model systems  We investigated the natural genetic variation of aggression using the Drosopihla melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel  DGRP   a collection of 205 inbred lines with fully sequenced genomes  We performed a genome wide association study  GWAS  and identified 74 genetic variants associated with variation in aggression  Additionally  we performed an independent experiment to replicate causal candidate variants by creating an advanced intercross population  AIP  from 6 lines representing the extremes of the DGRP   We measured aggressive behavior of 3 000 individuals after 10 generations of random mating from the AIP and performed extreme quantitative trait mapping  We observed that alleles significantly associated with aggression in the AIP replicated the allelic effect on aggression from the 6 extreme DGRP lines  Additionally  we generated a network of epistatic interactions using a model that tests for pairwise marker interactions across the DGRP  This analysis revealed that genes from these two populations are highly interconnected at the network level even though there is very little overlap of genes from the GWAS in the DGRP and AIP  Overall  these results show that our AIP replicated the allelic effects of aggression and that gene networks must be investigated when comparing a complex trait with epistatic interactions across two populations  
Evolution of Crassulacean acid metabolism in the Agavoideae  Crassulacean acid metabolism  CAM  is an adaptive mode of photosynthesis that has evolved at least 35 times independently across flowering plants   Plants which exhibit CAM are largely found in arid or water stressed habitats  where high transpiration rates during the day result in stomatal closure and a drop in carbon uptake  To accommodate their arid lifestyle  CAM plants have a temporal regulation of gas exchange  whereby they open their stomata for carbon uptake a night  when transpiration rates are lowest  Carbon is stored as malic acid in leaves until the daytime  when stomata close and CO2 is released around RuBisCO  increasing the carboxylation efficiency of the enzyme while conserving water  Understanding the evolution of CAM as a modified photosynthetic process will shed light on the causes and consequences of CAM evolution on speciation rates and biogeography  Here  we examine the repeated evolution of CAM in the subfamily Agavoideae  Asparagaceae  Asparagales   This subfamily consists of familiar genera like Agave and Yucca  and shows evidence of at least three gains and or losses of CAM  Using a sequence capture approach that estimates evolutionary histories from nearly 100 genes  we created a robust phylogeny of the subfamily using more than 60 species  Photosynthetic pathway was mapped onto the phylogeny and was used to find relationships between CAM  biogeography  and rates of evolution  Molecular evolutionary analyses were performed on key genes for CAM functionality to assess whether repeated CAM evolution shows parallel molecular and functional changes in gene sequences  By pairing novel phylogenomic methods with character trait assessment  we have a better sense of the impacts of this novel trait on the evolutionary history of Agavoideae species  
Gene expression explains patterns of evolution in tRNA synthetase genes interacting with mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs  Mitochondrial translation requires physical interactions between tRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase  aaRS  proteins encoded by the nuclear genome  In animals  it has been suggested that mitochondrial tRNAs  mt tRNAs  experience higher rates of mildly deleterious nucleotide substitutions relative to their nuclear encoded counterparts  cyt tRNAs   This dynamic provides an opportunity for elevated rates of compensatory evolution of aaRS proteins interacting with mt tRNAs  mt aaRS   relative to aaRS proteins interacting with cyt tRNAs  cyt aaRS   We demonstrate that mt aaRS genes do evolve at significantly higher rates  exemplified by higher dN and dN dS  relative to cyt aaRS genes  across mammals  birds  Drosophilids  and the Nasonia group of parasitic wasps  While these results are consistent with a compensatory evolution hypothesis  a more universal predictor of protein evolutionary rate is the level of gene expression  To attempt to disentangle these competing hypotheses  we 1  relate levels of gene expression  FPKM  with dN dS across a set of aaRS genes  2  test whether individual sites in aaRS genes are under positive selection  and 3  evaluate patterns of polymorphism and divergence in Drosophila  We show that FPKM explains much  19 49   of the variance in dN dS across aaRS genes  cyt aaRS genes are more highly expressed and have lower values of dN dS relative to mt aaRS genes across all taxa analyzed  Moreover  we are unable to detect any individual sites under significant positive selection in either class of aaRS genes  and the neutrality index of all aaRS genes is indicative of genes experiencing purifying selection  We thereby conclude that the level of gene expression may be the most parsimonious hypothesis for the rates of substitution observed in proteins interacting with mitochondrial versus cytoplasmic factors  
 Big groups  bad eggs and biogeography  regional and global patterns of brood parasitism s effect on cooperative breeding   There has been great interest in how complex social behaviors  such as cooperative breeding  evolve and are maintained  However  it is still unclear what exactly sparks the transition to group living  Recent work in birds has suggested a number of candidates for this change including environmental uncertainty  construction of expensive and defensible nests  and brood parasitism  Brood parasites are argued to precipitate group formation by selecting for group coordinated parasite defense  One recent study found a correlation between brood parasitism and cooperative breeding  but examined this relationship from a geographically restricted rather than global perspective  We investigated evolutionary correlations between brood parasitism and cooperative breeding at a global scale  including nearly all bird species and brood parasites  We found that at a global level  there is a strong positive correlation between cooperative breeding and brood parasitism  as found previously for specific continents  However  when we investigated our findings regionally we found that the global pattern is driven exclusively by relationships within Africa and Australia  suggesting a more complex causal relationship in the transition to cooperative breeding   We discuss possible explanations for contrasting global and regional results  
Short term density exposure affects male reproductive success in threespine stickleback  Gasterosteus aculeatus   Seasonal changes often occur which can shift population demography and which traits may be optimal in a given environment  So what might occur when demographic changes affect multiple male traits to different degrees  Using the freshwater fish  threespine stickleback  Gasterosteus aculeatus   whose density is known to change across the breeding season  we experimentally manipulated male density  high or low  to simulate early  and late season conditions  for two weeks and then randomly assigned individuals to single male nesting tanks  We then exposed the males to females daily and recorded nesting and courtship behavior  as well as male throat coloration and nest perimeter  area  and weight  We found that males at low density were more likely to nest  nested faster  and initiated courtship quicker than males at high density  Furthermore  although nest weights did not differ between treatments  nor did they predict success with females  male nest area and nest compactness  as measured by perimeter  were larger at low density  perhaps increasing their conspicuousness  This work demonstrates that even short term shifts in demography can have multiple consequences for the males that experience them  
Molecular basis of protogynous sex change in fish  Socially induced sex change is a common phenomenon in marine fishes  The Caribbean bluehead wrasse  Thalassoma bifasciatum   for example  exhibits female to male  protogynous  functional sex change based on social context  when the dominant male disappears  the largest female initiates sex change to replace him  This process entails a series of radical alterations at morphological  behavioral and physiological levels  which makes the bluehead wrasse a good experimental model for understanding plasticity of sexual development in response to the environment  Recent research suggests that  during sex change  social cues gathered by the brain are likely transduced into a cascade of physical signals that travel through the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis to the gonads  where they mediate steroid hormone synthesis and promote the gonadal transition  We still know little about the details  especially of how this process is regulated at the molecular level  My PhD research uses next generation sequencing approaches to detect what genes are expressed and at what level they are expressed in the brain and gonads at different time points across the sex change process in bluehead wrasses  By analyzing the expression pattern of these genes using downstream bioinformatics tools  we hope to gain a better understanding of how sex change is controlled at the most fundamental level in fish  In a more general sense  we anticipate this study will also provide important insights into the sex differentiation mechanisms  as well as behavioral and phenotypic plasticity in response to the environment  
Phylogenetic Skew  A New Index of Community Diversity  The distribution of divergence times among community members  which depends on species sampling patterns  is an important aspect of community phylogenetic structure  Nevertheless  the incorporation of information regarding divergence time distribution is lacking from current phylogenetic diversity measures  Community genetic diversity may be translated into an effective community size for a hypothetical community generated by random speciation  extinction  and species sampling  In this study  we formulated a new index of community diversity  the phylogenetic skew index  We analyzed its statistical behavior using data from a monthly monitored fish community at nuclear reactor water intakes in northern Taiwan  and developed a correction method to compensate for small sample size bias  We also performed a Bayesian analysis of variance under a gamma distribution model to detect annual and seasonal variation patterns in phylogenetic skew in the fish community  We show that our new phylogenetic skew index provides additional information regarding community diversity  
Dynamic sexual selection in a wild insect population  Sexual selection is a potent evolutionary force that results in some of the most exaggerated and variable traits in nature  The strong and consistent action of sexual selection should quickly deplete genetic variation in such traits  however this variation persists  How can such variation be sustained despite strong directional selection  One resolution to this problem is that selection is not consistent but fluctuates in strength and direction in response to environmental changes  Indeed  a vast majority of studies that measure selection in nature do so at one space or time  resulting in a static perception of selection  In this study  we use a sexually dimorphic insect species to investigate the influence of changing environments on sexual selection  The life history of the insect Leptoscelis tricolor  Hemiptera  Coreidae  is closely tied to its host plant  a resource that varies considerably over space and time  Mating  egg laying and development occur on host plants  In addition  males use their enlarged hind femurs as weapons while defending territories on distinct species of host plant  To understand if selection is responsive to temporal and environmental changes we measure selection as it occurs in nature  over time and across two distinct host plant species  Our results reveal that selection is weak but dynamic and that selection of body size and weapon size changes over space and time  In conclusion  our results reveal that environmental changes lead to dynamic patterns of selection on body and weapon size in L  tricolor   
guenomu  a Bayesian supertree program for species tree reconstruction  Most species tree reconstruction methods assume a single source of disagreement between the gene and species trees  hindering the inclusion of all available sequences in the analysis  Furthermore the elusive pursue of high quality data sets   which usually translates into actively discarding sequences and genes   stifles the contemplation of alternative phylogenomic scenarios    Here we extend the concept of Maximum Likelihood supertrees  Steel and Rodrigo 2008  where a hierarchical Bayesian structure describes how a species tree generates a collection of gene families  This model makes use of a multivariate distribution that penalizes gene trees far apart from the species tree according to several distances  The distances employed in the current implementation are based on most parsimonious reconciliations as well as on the mul tree generalization of the RF distance  although other distances can be easily implemented  Importantly our model does not assume that the paralogy and coalescence relations are known a priori  allowing for all available data from a gene family to be taken into account   We implemented this model into the program guenomu  which receives as input a collection of gene tree files as well as a list of species names  and returns the posterior distribution of species trees compatible with the set of genes  Each input gene file is assumed to have a posterior sample of trees from a gene family  such that their posterior frequencies are used as importance weights  We examine the performance of the program on synthetic data sets simulated under complex models  We show that guenomu can estimate reasonable species trees  while at the same time greatly reducing the gene tree uncertainty  
Phylogenomics and the Evolution of Paedomorphism in the Cyprinidae  The phylogenetic relationships of paedomorphic members of the Cyprinidae  species in the genera Paedocypris  Danionella  Sundadanio  have been challenging to infer  Morphological studies suggest that these paedomorphic taxa form a single clade  while multiple molecular studies have presented conflicting relationships with high support  Molecular phylogenetic studies that included mitochondrial sequences unite Paedocypris and Sundadanio as sister genera  while a study that included only nuclear loci place these three genera in disparate parts of the phylogeny  To address this difficult phylogenetic problem  we utilized sequence capture to enrich 393 loci in these fishes for a phylogenomic scale study  Preliminary analysis of 99 single copy loci revealed that Paedocypris  Danionella  and Sundadanio do not form a clade  and thus are convergent in their paedomorphism  however  the recovered relationships present a novel hypothesis for the placement of Paedocypris   
Mechanisms for the evolution of seasonal timing in incipient species of Ostrinia moths  Dormancy is an environmentally induced developmental process that results in arrested development and is a nearly universal life history strategy for animals and plants living in seasonal environments  The ability to synchronize dormant life stages with adverse climatic conditions  and active stages with favorable ones  is a key adaptive strategy for organisms living in variable environments  In insects  evolution of in the timing of dormancy termination has been reported to lead to ecologically relevant shifts in seasonal timing and may be a critical component to both long term persistence and speciation   Although there has been increasing focus on the correlation of particular genes or pathways with this transition period  the majority of identified genes are most likely downstream of the initial switch that triggers evolutionary divergence in dormancy program  Comparisons across taxonomic groups to identify long term evolutionary trends in the dormancy termination is also lacking   To understand the evolution of seasonality we use two sympatrically speciating strains of the European Corn Borer  Ostrinia nubilalis  that differ in emergence timing due to a shift in the timing of dormancy termination  Using whole transcriptome sequencing we  1  identify 51 candidate genes for seasonal timing based on location within the mapped QTL and differential expression or amino acid changes between strains  2  identify shifts in stress  metabolic  and endocrine regulation pathways that define dormancy termination vs  maintenance  and 3  observe convergence in transcriptional profiles across taxa  flies vs  moths  at developmental stages that define dormancy termination   We therefore nominate molecular mechanisms that drive initial evolutionary divergence and long term convergence in dormancy termination  
The Genome of the Ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi  Bringing Resolution to the Phylogenetic Position of the Ctenophores  Until recently  Ctenophora  the comb jellies  was the only non bilaterian animal phylum without a sequenced genome  and the phylogenetic position of the ctenophores has remained highly controversial  To understand the molecular innovations that drove the outbreak of diversity in the early evolution of animals  we have sequenced  assembled  annotated  and analyzed the 150 megabase genome of the ctenophore  Mnemiopsis leidyi  The availability of this high quality whole genome sequence data has enabled us to perform detailed phylogenetic analyses based on both sequence data and gene content  with the goal of bringing clarity to the long standing debate regarding the phylogenetic position of the ctenophores  The results of our comprehensive analyses  involving multiple lines of evidence  strongly suggest that ctenophores are the likely sister group to all other extant animals  This finding significantly affects our thinking regarding early animal evolution  For example  it appears that neural cell types were lost in poriferans  despite the fact that the sponge  Amphimedon queenslandica  possesses many of the neural components that are also present in Mnemiopsis  Further  the mesodermal cell types found in ctenophores and in the bilaterians may have evolved independently  based on a comparison of the inventory of genes associated with these cell types  Sequence data from the deeply sequenced transcriptomes of seven other ctenophores also provide support for the possibility of some degree of independent evolution  These new sequence data  coupled with the inherent complexity of non bilaterian species such as Mnemiopsis  open up the intriguing possibility that these animal species have the potential to provide a strong foundation for translational studies focused on specific human diseases  Using a comparative genomics approach  we find that non bilaterian animals have the potential to serve as viable models for studying various important classes of human diseases  
The evolution of fur colour  a marsupial perspective  Fur colour is critical in allowing mammals to camouflage themselves  and as such is subject to strong natural selective pressures  Mammals may also rely on their fur color to signal status  and to assist thermoregulation  Yet there has been very little quantification of fur coloration  and the few research studies of fur color and its evolution have largely overlooked the marsupials  This large group of mammals  which includes well known species such as the red kangaroo and koala  offers some valuable opportunities to better understand the evolution of fur colour due to both their divergence from eutherian mammals approximately 160 million years ago  and because of some unusual ecological trends of the group  For example  most marsupial species are nocturnal  and they occur across a diverse range of environments  with many marsupial species inhabiting thermally extreme conditions  Some of the more interesting case studies include a species with olive green fur colour  the green ringtail possum  and some populations of common brushtail possum that may have their fur colour determined by maternal diet  
Skull integration and modularity in five toad species of the Rhinella granulosa group  Morphological integration and modularity are related concepts that refer to the relative degrees of connectivity among morphological elements within a complex structure  Morphological integration theory states that integration modularity patterns are explained by functional and or developmental interactions among the elements  Integration patterns and modularity hypothesis were never assessed in adult toads  We worked with five closely related toad species   R  granulosa  R  merianae  R  mirandariberoi  R  pygmea and R  major   to compare phenotypic covariance and correlation structure of skull bones and its integration magnitudes  We also performed a modularity test in which we hypothesized three functional modules  neurocranium  snout and suspensorium  and a full integration hypothesis  three modules tested concomitantly   We scanned all skulls with a microtomography X ray system and placed 42 landmarks in the 3D skulls by using the TINA Landmark software  All individuals were measured twice to assess distance repeatability  Twenty eight linear distances were calculated and covariance correlation matrices were constructed  Matrix repeatability was calculated by bootstrapping  We compared species matrices with Krzanowski correlation  Integration magnitudes were calculated as the squared average correlation  r2  from the species correlation matrices and indicate the overall degree of connectivity among the distances  Since toads have indeterminate growth  size variation alone could ensure similarity among the species matrices  so we also compared them after removing size variation  residual matrices   The modularity test was done by correlating theoretical correlation matrices  which express the hypothetical functional modules  and the empirical matrices  Mean distance repeatability for all species was 0 98  Matrix repeatability ranged from 0 87 to 0 94  Covariance and correlation species matrices were highly similar both for raw  0 89 + 0 04 and 0 91 + 0 03  respectively  and residual matrices  0 87 + 0 05 and 0 93 + 0 05  respectively   Integration indexes r2 varied from 0 22 for R  pygmea to 0 43 for R  major  reflecting different percentages of variation explained by the PC1  size related vector  of the covariance matrices  52  to 79    Modularity tests detected the modules snout and suspensorium for all species  except R  pygmea  in which only the suspensorium appeared  The snout module was also detected in the residual matrices of all species  along with the full integration hypothesis in three species  Even though size variation is a major component of the individual species phenotypic morphospace  its removal did not change matrix similarity among the species  Thus  species matrix similarity must be a consequence of the alike modular organization of skull bones in distinct functional developmental units  
Characterizing Independent Adaptive Mutations in Yeast Experimental Evolution Using DNA Barcodes  The study of adaptation suffers from the lack of a sufficiently large set of adaptive events for a statistically meaningful analysis  Consequently we still have a cursory understanding of the rate of adaptation  the distribution of effect sizes of individual adaptive mutations  and the possible molecular targets for adaptation in most systems  Here we utilize an innovative DNA barcoding approach to track the frequency trajectories of  500 000 otherwise identical clones of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae evolving in a single experiment under a glucose limited regime  From the trajectories  we identify and isolate 300 independent adaptive clones relatively early in the evolution  when most clones are likely to contain only a single adaptive mutation  We then sequence the genomes of all of these clones to isolate the putative adaptive mutations present on each lineage  We will discuss our findings in relation to the types of mutations that are adaptive e g  point mutations  short indels  copy number variants or structural variants and whether these mutations are regulatory or in protein coding regions as well as their predicted functional impact  We will also consider whether particular genes or pathways are common targets for adaptation under our conditions  and whether the strength of the fitness effects cluster by genetic target or the number of putative adaptive mutations identified in each clone   
Phylogenomics reveals rapid and complex evolutionary divergence and speciation in wild Solanum  To identify the genetic and genomic changes that accompany speciation  studies have begun to examine divergence across whole genomes in groups of closely related species  These phylogenomic studies can reveal the progression of evolutionary change along a  speciation continuum   as well as the specific loci that contribute to ecological and reproductive differentiation among lineages   We used RNA Seq from normalized multi tissue transcriptomes to examine evolutionary relationships and historical divergence among all species in the diverse plant group Solanum section Lycopersicon  wild tomatoes   This diploid  chromosomally co linear clade of 13 species began diversifying  2 MYA  Extant species are distinguished by substantial ecogeographic  morphological  and physiological trait differences  in addition to well characterized pre  and postzygotic isolating barriers   Transcriptomes from 24 genotypes  1 3 accessions from each species  plus an outgroup  generated 157 7 Gb of sequence  av  6 6 Gb per accession    De novo and reference based assembly generated a set of >16 000 high quality orthologous transcripts across all lineages  >45  of known coding regions in the tomato genome    Average pairwise sequence divergence among accessions was 
Sexually selected sperm competition genes also contribute to postmating species barriers  conspecific sperm precedence  between D  melanogaster and D   Sexual selection and sexual conflict are often considered important drivers of speciation  Indeed  sister species are frequently primarily isolated by traits thought to have evolved by sexual selection and or conflict  and models of speciation suggest that traits involved in intrapopulation sexual dynamics can ultimately lead to reproductive isolation  However  whether reproductive isolation between species evolves directly as a consequence of intrapopulation sexual dynamics remains empirically unresolved  in part because knowledge of the genetic mechanisms  if any  connecting these processes is limited  Here we provide evidence of a direct mechanistic link between intraspecies sexual selection and reproductive isolation  We examined genes with known roles in intraspecific sperm competition in D  melanogaster and assayed their impact on conspecific sperm precedence  We found that two such genes contribute to both offensive sperm competition and conspecific sperm precedence  knockdown lines had both lower competitive ability against D  melanogaster conspecifics  and were no longer able to displace heterospecific D  simulans in competitive matings  In comparison  another locus essential for intraspecific sperm competition  does not contribute to conspecific sperm precedence  These data indicate that several important molecular players in sperm competitive interactions have an additional role in similar interactions that enforce post mating reproductive isolation between species  and show that sexual selection and reproductive isolation can act on the same molecular targets in a gene specific manner  All three loci show elevated rates of molecular evolution compared to other known D  melanogaster sperm competition genes  indicating that rapid evolution per se is not responsible for this dual role in sexual competition and sexual isolation  Rather  comparatively less pleiotropic constraint  and or differential involvement in the specific modality underlying sexual isolation  might explain the differential involvement of these loci in CSP  
The Trojan Female Technique   A novel approach for pest population control  Humankind s ongoing battle with pest species spans millennia  Pests cause or carry disease  damage or consume food crops and other resources  and drive global environmental change  Conventional approaches to pest management usually involve lethal control  but such approaches are costly  of varying efficiency  and often have ethical issues  Thus  pest management via control of reproductive output is increasingly considered an optimal solution  One of the most successful such  fertility control  strategies developed to date is the sterile male technique  SMT   in which large numbers of sterile males are released into a population each generation  However  this approach is time consuming  labour intensive and costly  We use mathematical models to test a new twist on the SMT  utilising maternally inherited mitochondrial  mtDNA  mutations that affect male  but not female reproductive fitness   Trojan Females  carrying such mutations  and their female descendants  produce  sterile male  equivalents under natural conditions over multiple generations  We find that the Trojan Female Technique  TFT  has the potential to be a novel humane approach for pest control  Single large releases and relatively few small repeat releases of Trojan Females both provided effective and persistent control within relatively few generations  Although greatest efficacy was predicted for high turnover species  the additive nature of multiple releases made the TFT applicable to the full range of life histories modelled  The extensive conservation of mtDNA among eukaryotes suggests this approach could have broad utility for pest control  
Plant defenses in the genus Physalis are not constrained by trade offs between constitutive and induced defenses  Plants have evolved a variety of defenses  such as trichomes  tough leaves  or production of toxic chemicals  to protect themselves from herbivores  These defenses are often costly for plants to produce and therefore it is hypothesized that trade offs should exist between growth and defense or between potentially redundant defenses  such as constitutive and induced defenses   A trade off between constitutive and induced defenses could explain variation between species in plant defenses  however  studies at different evolutionary scales and in different systems have failed to demonstrate a universal positive or negative association between constitutive and induced defenses  This work aims to determine whether other factors  such as life history or mating system  affect levels of constitutive and induced defenses  To address these questions  I examined the relationship between constitutive and induced defenses in species of the genus Physalis  Solanacea  with different life histories mating systems  Assays of Manduca sexta herbivore growth rates  a specialist on Solanaceous species  on undamaged and induced plants of each species were used to quantify overall levels of plant resistance  Examination of these species suggests no trade off between constitutive and induced defenses  Although annual and perennial species are predicted to have different allocation to constitutive and induced defenses based on variation in temporal herbivore environment  annual and perennial species did not differ in levels of constitutive or induced resistance  This indicates that plant defenses within Physalis are not constrained by life history or by trade offs between constitutive and induced defenses  Hence  these two types of defense are not redundant and the lack of a trade off suggests that different mechanisms are maintaining variation in plant defensive strategies  
Hungry mothers ability to abort and cannibalize their offspring enables the evolution of placentotrophy in a lizard  Placentotrophy  the nourishment of offspring via a placenta  has evolved repeatedly in vertebrates  including six times in squamates  Prior studies have predicted that the evolution of placentotrophy requires that food resources be abundant and stable throughout gestation  If food availability is not consistently abundant enough to permit successful reproduction  theory predicts that placentotrophic females should be pre adapted to recoup nutrition invested in reproduction  We tested these hypotheses in the placentotrophic skink  Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii  We fed pregnant females one of four diets  high constant  high stochastic  low constant  and low stochastic  and tested the effects of both food amount and stochasticity of food availability on maternal body composition  neonate composition  developmental success  and cannibalism rate  Low food availability significantly reduced developmental success  maternal growth  neonate size  and maternal and neonate energy  fat  and protein contents  Females on low food diets were significantly more likely to cannibalize both undeveloped eggs and developed offspring  Stochasticity of food availability did not significantly affect any maternal or offspring characteristic  Taken together  our results support the hypotheses that placentotrophy is most likely to be a successful strategy of offspring provisioning when food resources are abundant  and that abortion and cannibalism allows females to recoup nutrition provisioned to offspring if food resources are too low to permit successful reproduction  
Auto toxicity the evolution of the muscular voltage gated sodium channel in Phyllobates poison frogs  The genetic basis and origin of phenotypic changes are among main drivers of a lineage s ability to respond to selection pressures  Do these changes arise from de novo mutation  or does natural selection favor preexisting variants  i e  standing variation  that become beneficial under new selective regimes  Toxic organisms must evolve mechanisms to avoid self intoxication  however  these mechanisms usually have costs  For instance  resistance to neurotoxins many times involves modifications  of ion transport proteins  which often negatively influence the performance of such proteins  Hence  although preexisting toxin resistant variants can allow for a faster response to changes in selective regimes  they are expected to have lower probabilities of persistence in a population before changes in selective regimes make them beneficial  due to their deleterious effects  Here  we examine the evolution of resistance to auto toxicity in Phyllobates poison frogs  bearers of batrachotoxin  BTX   possibly the most potent known neurotoxin of natural origin  which covalently binds to voltage gated sodium channels  rendering neurons useless  We sequenced regions of the muscular voltage gated sodium channel involved in BTX binding for several Phyllobates and closely related species  and found four amino acid substitutions at BTX binding sites present in Phyllobates species  Three of these originated simultaneously with BTX bearing  while the remaining one originated before BTX  suggesting that standing variation and de novo origination have contributed to batrachotoxin resistance in Phyllobates frogs   
Sexy signals  gamete recognition is a reproductive mechanism and isolating barrier in wild tomato species  Solanum sect  Lycopersicon   Recognition and chemoattraction between male and female gametes has been observed in a broad range of sexually reproducing organisms  including both internally and externally fertilizing species  Gamete recognition is thus thought to be a widespread  fundamental mechanism that facilitates fertilization  Conversely  misrecognition of gamete chemical cues can disrupt interspecific mating events  the resulting gamete isolation is a potentially powerful  though relatively poorly understood reproductive isolating barrier between species  Here we demonstrate that active gamete recognition occurs within species in the wild tomato clade consistent with other plant and animal systems and can also act as a strong postmating  prezygotic isolating barrier between some species  Using an in vitro assay that allows gamete interactions between male pollen tubes and female ovules to be observed directly  we quantified gamete recognition both within and between three tomato species  Solanum lycopersicum  S  pimpinellifolium and S  pennellii   In conspecific assays  growing pollen tubes actively reorient toward and make contact with conspecific ovules  indicative of an active behavioral reaction by pollen tubes in response to an ovule secreted chemoattractant  In vitro tests of heterospecific gamete interactions between species that are very closely related  S  lycopersicum and S  pimpinellifolium  indicate equally high gamete recognition and no evidence for gamete isolation  In contrast  in vitro gamete interactions between more distantly related species  diverged  2 MY  show a reduction in pollen tube recognition of heterospecific ovules  consistent with the evolution of partial gamete isolation  These data indicate that gamete recognition can act as a postmating  prezygotic reproductive isolating barrier in the wild tomato clade  These results provide the basis for ongoing studies to identify the molecular basis of divergent heterospecific gamete signaling  based on biomolecular features of known gamete chemoattractants in other systems   
Is the general time reversible model bad for phylogenetics   The general time reversible  GTR  model has been the workhorse of molecular phylogenetics for the last decade  GTR sits at the top of the ModelTest hierarchy of models  Posada and Crandall 1998  and  usually with the addition of invariant sites and a gamma distribution of rates across sites  is currently by far the most commonly selected model for phylogenetic inference  However  a recent publication  Sumner et al  2012  shows that GTR  along with several other commonly used models  has an undesirable mathematical property that may be a cause of concern for the thoughtful phylogeneticist   In mathematical terms  the problem is simple  matrix multiplication of two GTR substitution matrices does not return another GTR matrix  It is the purpose of this talk to give examples that demonstrate why this lack of closure may pose a problem for phylogenetic analysis and thus add GTR to the growing list of factors that are known to cause model misspecification in phylogenetics  
Nutritional contributions by gut symbionts ensures metabolic homeostasis in an insect host  Within the Pyrrhocoridae  Hemiptera   recent characterization of the microbial community revealed a consistent and conserved microbiota  with the notable co occurance of two actinobacterial taxa  Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter spp   throughout the M3 and M4 regions of the insects mid gut  Similar to many hemipterans  firebugs rely on egg smearing for the vertical transmission of their gut symbionts  This involves the deposition of symbiont bearing droplets by adult females over newly laid eggs  and the subsequent oral uptake of the microbes by the hatched nymphs  Across two species of firebugs  Pyrrhocoris apterus and Dysdercus fasciatus   we demonstrate that egg surface sterilization results in symbiont deprived individuals  aposymbionts  that exhibit slower growth rates  higher mortality and lower reproductive success  suggesting an essential function for the actinobacterial symbionts  Additional findings from artificial diet experiments demonstrate that the symbionts contribute towards their host through the provisioning of B vitamins  a condition further supported by the discovery of complete pathways for the biosynthesis of thiamine  B1   riboflavin  B2   nicotinamide  B3   pantothenate  B5  and folic acid  B9  in the sequenced genome of C  glomerans  Additionally  comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in the mid gut regions of firebugs revealed a differential up regulation of genes involved in the import and processing of B vitamins among aposymbionts relative to symbiont bearing individuals  This is consistent with the regulatory mechanisms known for the B vitamin metabolism  where specific transcriptional activators are preferentially expressed in the absence of their respective vitamin co factors  i e  in case of deficiency   Normal expression levels of these genes  however  can be restored in firebugs either through the artificial supplementation of B vitamins into the insects diet or reinfection with actinobacterial symbionts  Our findings suggest a highly integrated partnership between firebugs and their gut symbionts  and add to a large body of work demonstrating the role of microbial partners towards enhancing the competitive ability of their hosts through the provisioning of essential nutrients  
Does Energy Availability Predict Gastropod Reproductive Strategies   The diversity of reproductive strategies in nature is shaped by a plethora of factors including energy availability  For example  because low temperatures and limited food availability could increase larval exposure to predation by slowing development  these habitats may select against pelagic larvae   In addition  the frequency of hermaphroditism could increase under low food availability as population density  and hence mate availability  drops   We test these hypotheses by exploring the relationships between reproductive life history traits and energy availability for 189 marine gastropod families   Only larval type was related to energy availability with the odds of having planktotrophic larvae versus direct development decreasing by 1  with every one unit increase in the square root of carbon flux   Simultaneous hermaphroditism also potentially increases with carbon flux  but this effect disappears when accounting for evolutionary relationships among taxa   Our findings do not support current hypotheses on the nature of reproductive strategies and energy availability  Instead  they suggest that some reproductive strategies are too energetically expensive at low food availabilities and others serve to capitalize on opportunities for aggregation or increased energy availability   
Capturing single copy nuclear genes and its applications in phylogenetics  Single copy nuclear genes often have slower rate in their coding region than non coding gene markers  They are easy to be aligned and often were studied with well characterized molecular evolution models  Thus  single copy nuclear genes are naturally good markers for phylogenetics  We have developed a cross species hybridization method to enrich target genes and applied next gen sequencing on the enriched library to collect sequences of thousands of genes and hundreds of species  Here we present results from our phylogenetic studies on fishes  snakes and other vertebrates using this method  
A phylogenetic analysis of gynodioecy and its correlates in the flowering plants  Gynodioecy  a breeding system where plants are female or hermaphroditic  has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of dioecy  a breeding system where plants are male or female   Despite the importance of gynodioecy  a database of gynodioecious species has not yet been assembled   This has limited our ability to test whether the evolution of gynodioecy and dioecy are correlated and to identify traits associated with gynodioecy   We assembled a database of gynodioecious species  and used it determine the frequency and distribution of gynodioecy across the angiosperms   We also tested whether gynodioecy is associated with dioecy  or with traits previously associated with gynodioecy  an herbaceous growth form  and a temperate zone distribution   We found that fewer than 1  of species were gynodioecious  but gynodioecious species occur in 81 of 428 families   Compared to previous studies that surveyed breeding systems within local floras  we found fewer gynodioecious species  but more families that contained gynodioecious species   These 81 families were more likely to also contain dioecious species  herbaceous species  and species with a temperate zone distribution  Although our results supported the hypothesis that dioecy evolves via gynodioecy  we also found that gynodioecy was associated with different morphological and ecological traits than dioecy   This suggests that different conditions select for the evolution of gynodioecy versus dioecy  
An altitudinal cline in an ultraviolet floral trait is associated with changes in selection and pollination context       Spatially varying selection can drive phenotypic diversification and lead to speciation  Floral phenotype  in particular  can covary with pollinator mediated selection  but not all floral traits relevant to pollinators are obvious to humans and thus have not been subjects of selection studies  Here  we identify an altitudinal cline of increasing size of the ultraviolet  UV  bullseye pattern  UV reflecting petal tips  UV absorbing bases  on flowers of Argentina anserina  Rosaceae   and test whether pollinator mediated selection is responsible for maintenance of the cline by documenting the pollinator assemblage  flower visitor preferences  and selection at four populations along the gradient  The size of the UV bullseye increased with the proportion of flower visitors that were dipterans  Flowers manipulated to have larger bullseyes were visited more often by insects than those with smaller bullseyes at high  but not at low altitude sites  Phenotypic selection via pollen receipt was stronger on the UV bullseye than on floral size  display  or color  Selection favored smaller bullseyes at the lowest altitude  larger bullseyes at the highest altitude  and increased with both dipteran abundance and preference for a larger bullseye  Results indicate that pollinators exert selection on floral patterns invisible to humans  and contribute to clinal variation in these traits  and thus add a new dimension to studies of geographic selection mosaics   
The evolutionary dynamics of endogenous retroviruses by computer simulations  Endogenous retroviruses  ERVs  are viewed as ancient retroviral infections in vertebrate genomes and are commonly referred to as viral  fossils   accounting for approximately 8  of the human genome  They are retroviruses that have infected and colonized germ cells and are passed to the offspring  Because proviruses have the potential to disrupt genes and to change the host gene expression  which might lead to diseases  they are negatively selected and end up losing their viral function  becoming unable to re infect  However  some ERVs are still able to re infect because they still have intact viral genes  They are therefore theoretically able to form viral particles  even after millions of years within the host genome  yet the reason for this remains elusive  In this study we developed algorithms to understand the evolutionary dynamics of full length ERVs  genome size   10 000 bp  in host genomes by expanding described transposable element  TE  models known as the  strict master  and  transposon  models  The first model assumes that only one element of a given family is capable of producing a copy  while the second model assumes that all elements of a given family are equally like to produce a new copy in the host genome  By simulating both phylogenetic trees and DNA sequences  we tested how viral inactivity and ongoing activity for retrotranposition or reinfection of an ERV family influences phylogeny shape  We tested additional parameters such as virus mutation rate and the rate of an ERV to generate a new copy in the host genome  Current results show that phylogenetic programs do not always recover the  true  phylogenetic tree topology when DNA sequences are used to reconstruct the phylogeny  These results show promise with respect to our understanding of activity and inactivity of ERVs in vertebrate host genomes  It suggests that although ERV tree topologies are commonly referred to as following a  strict master  or  transposon  models by visual inspection  we should be careful in doing so  Results suggest that there are regions in the tree topology space where we cannot distinguish between the different models  A way of sorting this problem out would be to combine information of the tree branch lengths to the tree topology in order to better distinguish these different models  
Highly variable recombinational landscape modulates efficacy of natural selection in birds  Determining the rate of protein evolution and identifying the causes of its variation across the genome are powerful ways to understand forces that are important for genome evolution  By using a multi tissue transcriptome data set from great tit  Parus major   we analysed patterns of molecular evolution between two passerine birds  great tit and zebra finch  Taeniopygia guttata   using the chicken genome  Gallus gallus  as an outgroup  We investigated whether a special feature of avian genomes  the highly variable recombinational landscape  modulates the efficacy of natural selection through the effects of Hill Robertson interference  which predicts that selection should be more effective in removing deleterious mutations and incorporating beneficial mutations in high recombination regions than in low recombination regions  In agreement with these predictions  genes located in low recombination regions tend to have a high proportion of neutrally evolving sites and relaxed selective constraint on sites subject to purifying selection  whereas genes that show strong support for past episodes of positive selection appear disproportionally in high recombination regions  There is also evidence that genes located in high recombination regions tend to have higher gene expression specificity than those located in low recombination regions  Furthermore  more compact genes  i e   those with fewer shorter introns or shorter proteins  evolve faster than less compact ones  In sum  our results demonstrate that transcriptome sequencing is a powerful method to answer fundamental questions about genome evolution in non model organisms  
Contrasting patterns of morphological diversity and climatic preferences in the genus Anthurium  Araceae   The genus Anthurium  Araceae  comprises more than 1 000 Neotropical species  distributed from southern Mexico to northern Argentina  The most recent molecular phylogeny of the genus recovered 18 strongly supported clades that vary in terms of their geographic range size  morphological diversity  and climatic niche preferences  This study makes use of distribution models  molecular phylogenetics  morphological analysis  and analogy with community ecology indices to understand what are the morphological patterns and climatic preferences of clades with either restricted or widespread geographical distributions  It was found that clade geographic extent is correlated with climatic niche width  but not with amount of morphological differentiation or number of species  Climatic niche diversity and morphological diversification seem to be decoupled within Anthurium  So that  species that belong to clades that have restricted distributions have more similar climatic niche preferences but are more dissimilar morphologically  On the contrary  widely distributed clades containing species with similar climatic niches show very uniform overall morphology  Interestingly  phylogenetic structure at the subgeneric level  i e  among major clades  does not seem to play an important role in determining species richness  or influencing climatic niche width and morphological diversity within Anthurium  
Survival of the fattest  Indices of body condition do not predict fitness in the brown anole  Anolis sagrei   Measures of body mass and length are commonly used to derive indices of condition  which are often assumed to reflect the energetic state of an animal and  by extension  to predict its fitness  However  the relationship between condition and fitness is rarely quantified  and the appropriate method s  for deriving indices of condition are frequently debated  We synthesized a decade of phenotypic selection studies involving over 4 600 individual lizards  Anolis sagrei  and 41 replicates of selection across seven populations to test the common assumption that body condition is a strong predictor of adult survival  We also compared inferences about natural selection using two indices of condition  the popular residual index  Ri   and the scaled mass index  Mi   which was recently proposed as a more robust alternative  Relative to variance in selection among replicates and to error associated with the estimation of selection gradients  variance due to the use of alternative condition indices was minor and effectively negligible  Contrary to the intuitive prediction that individuals in better condition should exhibit higher survival  we found no evidence for strong or consistent linear selection for higher condition in either males or females  Significant quadratic selection on condition was similarly rare in both sexes  Correlational selection favored combinations of large size and high condition in males  but not females  Collectively  our results indicate that inferences about natural selection may be robust to the choice between indices of condition  but that indices of condition can be unreliable as proxies for fitness  particularly when the relationship between fitness and condition is contingent upon interactions with other traits  
Opposing genotype by environment interactions and the maintenance of a genetic color polymorphism in a livebearing fish  Genetic variation persists within populations despite the eroding forces of natural and sexual selection   While environmental heterogeneity offers a potential solution to this evolutionary problem  examples in non model systems are sparse and we have yet to fully understand functional mechanisms of intra population processes   Livebearing fishes of the genus Xiphophorus are among the most variable species in terms of genetically controlled color and pattern polymorphisms   The variable platyfish  X  variatus  exhibits polymorphism at a single locus with up to six  allelic tailspot patterns within single populations   Here we studied the effects and interaction of two environmental variables  temperature and food level  on two fitness related traits in two genotypes of X  variatus   There was a significant genotype by environment  GxE  interaction with food stress on upper thermal limits  UTL   in which the wildtype genotype had a lower UTLs under normal food conditions but had higher UTLs than the other genotype under food stress   There was also a GxE interaction with thermal stress on energetic state   Wildtype fish gained more body mass than the other genotype at 25 ¡C but lost significantly more body mass under thermal stress at 34 ¡C   Wildtype fish therefore outperformed in UTLs during food stress  but underperformed in energetic state during thermal stress   The relative performance of the two genotypes was reversed between stress and non stress conditions for the two environmental variables and each environmental variable affected performance in a different trait   Furthermore  data on body condition of adult males from multiple collections in natural populations was consistent with our laboratory experiment  wildtype males had poorer condition relative to other genotypes following periods of greater thermal stress   The findings demonstrate how the relative fitness of genotypes is not only dependent upon the environmental context but upon the trait being measured   The ability to withstand stressful temperatures is central to organismal survival and of particular importance given the stress intensifying effects of global climate change   Energetic state  i e   body condition  is important not only from a survival perspective due to associations with immune function  for example  but plays a role in mate choice in livebearing fishes   Better male body condition is associated with female preference  male courtship behavior  and reduced offspring investment costs to females   The effects of heterogeneity in environmental variables such as temperature therefore can have simultaneous consequences for natural and sexual selection in the context of maintaining polymorphism   
Repeatability of genomic divergence during non ecological speciation  The repeated evolution of traits in organisms facing similar selective constraints is considered to be fundamental evidence for the role of natural selection on the formation of new species  Repeated patterns of genomic divergence have been well described in taxa undergoing ecological divergence  where extrinsic or  environmentally dependent  selection often targets the same genomic regions  Theoretically  the same pattern can arise by means of intrinsic selection favoring intragenomic co evolution during non ecological divergence  but empirical demonstrations of this process are scarce  We test this hypothesis by examining allopatric population of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus  between which hybrid breakdown has evolved repeatedly  likely as a result of co evolving gene complexes  Analyses of transcriptome wide patterns of divergence and polymorphism show that low effective population sizes cause an exponential sorting of genetic variability during allopatric divergence  leading to a genome wide fixation of alternative alleles in independent populations  Five inter population comparisons at three different stages of divergence show that non synonymous mutations tend to accumulate in hotspot genes  suggesting that these could cause constant selection over functional interacting proteins during species formation  Likewise  there is a significant overlap in the proteins with stronger signatures of positive selection  suggesting that intrinsic selection often targets continuously the same loci  Together  our results suggest that  in the absence of extrinsic selection  intragenomic co evolution can result in repeatable and predictable patterns of genomic divergence  
Phylogeny and biogeography of two North American lamioid mint lineages  Lamiaceae   The angiosperm family Lamiaceae is considered one of the most distinctive and derived angiosperm lineages of major ecological  evolutionary  cultural  and economic importance  Its second largest subfamily  Lamioideae  encompasses two lineages with members in the New World  the tribes Stachydeae and Synandreae  Stachydeae is a widespread and taxonomically complex lineage with 470 species  exhibiting remarkable morphological  ecological  biogeographical  and chromosomal diversity  and includes the globally distributed Stachys  as well as one of the largest Hawaiian angiosperm radiations  the endemic mints  Our recent studies with chloroplast  cpDNA  and ribosomal DNA  rDNA  loci suggested two independent migration events of Stachys to the New World and that dispersal to Hawaii appears to have happened only once  from their closest  contemporary relatives in Southwestern US  around approximately 4 Mya  Results from cpDNA and rDNA loci show incongruence  suggesting a possible hybrid origin for the Hawaiian mints involving different New World Stachys lineages  The South American Stachys appear to have diversified from within two Mesoamerican lineages and could have arisen from hybridization events as well  In order to overcome the biases from maternally inherited cpDNA  and concerted evolution in rDNA markers  and to better resolve the relationships between the Hawaiian mints and their New World Stachys relatives  we utilized independently inherited  nuclear encoded low copy loci  Although the individual gene trees from the different loci are incongruent  the topology of the species tree derived from a combined coalescent analysis reflects that of the rDNA tree derived from our previous study  showing a reticulate origin of the Hawaiian mints from temperate North American Stachys species  The tribe Synandreae  the only other lamioid lineage native to the New World  consists of five genera  which seemingly arose from an independent colonization of the New World  although single closest lamioid relative is yet to be defined  Through phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of low copy nuclear markers  we attempted to disentangle the relationships within this tribe  and its position among other lamioid mints  Our results corroborate previous studies  and strongly support the monophyly of Synandreae  distantly related to Stachydeae  Such comparative studies of the mints into the Americas may increase our understanding of processes involved in the origin  establishment and diversification of early angiosperms globally  as well as help elucidate the broader evolutionary aspects of how major early angiosperms lineages colonized and established in the Americas  
 Bayesian Inference of Population Sizes  Migration Rates and Divergence Times Based on Importance Sampling of Coalescent Trees   Estimating the demographic history of a group of populations has been a major focus in population genetics  Hey and Nielsen  2007  developed a method to estimate the demographic parameters under an Isolation with Migration model  implemented in the IMa and IMa2 programs   Under this method  genealogies and divergence times are first jointly sampled from a Markov chain Monte Carlo  MCMC  simulation in which other demographic parameters are integrated out analytically  Then the joint posterior density of population sizes and migrations rates are approximated from the sampled genealogies  However  the MCMC simulations in this approach are computationally expensive because of a large state space and because the correlation between genealogies and divergence times causes poor mixing  We propose here a new Bayesian model which improves the MCMC part of the original method without introducing biases in demographic parameter estimations  By applying importance sampling  we first simulate by MCMC over coalescent trees rather than over genealogies and divergence times  The coalescent tree space is much smaller than the genealogy space  since coalescent trees do not carry the information about migration events  As a second step  the joint density of all the demographic parameters is approximated from the sampled coalescent trees  For a given demographic history  it is required to compute the conditional probability of a coalescent tree  This computation is analytically done by considering a coalescent tree as a continuous time Markov chain of lineages in a population tree  Andersen et al   2013   A comparison between the original and new methods will be presented  
PASTA  A new method to co estimate alignments and trees  even on ultra large datasets  with high accuracy and speed  Multiple sequence alignment  MSA  is a basic step in many bioinformatics analyses  including predicting the structure and function of RNAs and proteins and estimating phylogenies   SATe  Liu et al   Science 2009 and Systematic Biology 2012  provided a fast and highly accurate method to co estimate alignments and trees  and has been used to analyze many biological datasets  Yet  even SATe is unable to analyze extremely large datasets with more than 50 000 sequences  whereas phylogenetic analyses of sequence datasets containing more than 100 000 nucleotide sequences are being attempted by at least two groups that we are aware of  the iPTOL project and the Thousand Transcriptome project  1KP    We present PASTA   Practical Alignments using SATe and TrAnsitivity   a new method to co estimate alignments and trees for nucleotide or amino acid sequences  The key to the accuracy and scalability of PASTA is the novel technique it uses for estimating an alignment on a guide tree  As in SATe  PASTA uses the centroid edge dataset decomposition technique and computes MAFFT linsi alignments on the subsets  however  PASTA and SATe merge these subset alignments into an alignment on the full dataset using very different techniques  While SATe uses Opal to hierarchically merge all the subset alignments into a single alignment  PASTA uses Opal only to merge pairs of adjacent subset alignments  producing overlapping alignments  then treats each resultant alignment as an equivalence relation and uses transitivity to merge these larger alignments  The result is a very fast re alignment method that is highly parallelizable and easily scales to large datasets    PASTA is dramatically faster than SATe on large datasets  and produces much more accurate alignments and trees than SATe  We demonstrate PASTA s speed and accuracy on a collection of datasets  including large protein datasets  RNA datasets  and a simulated 200K sequence RNASim dataset  All these analyses   including the 200 000 sequence dataset  complete in less than 24 hours using PASTA on a 12 core machine    PASTA is available in open source form  uses the same GUI as SATe  and can be obtained from             http   www cs utexas edu users phylo software pasta index html 
Assessing the utility of whole genome amplified DNA for next generation phylogeography and population genomics  Low quantity DNA is often a limitation when working in the fields of clinical research and forensic science  However  DNA limitation can also be a hindrance in ecological and evolutionary research programs due to a range of factors including tissue type and preservation method  A potential solution to low quantity DNA lies in whole genome amplification  WGA  techniques that can substantially increase DNA yield throughout the genome  Although early Sanger based studies suggest that many WGA methods yield highly unbiased genome representation and allelic concordance with genomic DNA  gDNA   few studies have quantified how these patterns scale with genome level data  As more laboratories begin to utilize next generation DNA sequencing methods in their individual research programs  additional studies are needed to examine and quantify the potential bias of WGA  Here  we use multiple displacement amplification and double digest RAD sequencing on the grey mouse lemur  Microcebus murinus  to test the null hypothesis of no difference in genome coverage or SNP concordance between WGA DNA and gDNA  Our results show extremely high SNP concordance between samples when genotyping both de novo and with a reference genome when specifying a minimum coverage depth of 20x  Genome coverage is also similar between WGA DNA and gDNA and allelic dropout is not observed  We also examine how SNP concordance varies based on coverage threshold and results suggest that SNP genotyping without a reference should be based on a minimum of 12x coverage  whereas when genotyping with a reference the same level of congruence is obtained with 8x coverage  At 20x coverage we observe no significant difference in the number of shared loci with SNPs and percent identical SNPs when genotyping de novo versus with a reference  These results suggest that WGA may be a suitable solution for next generation population genomic studies when DNA quantity would otherwise be a limiting factor  
Physical and chemical interactions mediate sex change in a protandrous gastropod  Sequential hermaphroditism is a widespread phenomenon among animals   Theory suggests that sequential hermaphrodites maximize their lifetime reproductive output by changing sex in response to cues  including those from social environments   Crepidula fornicata  Gastropoda  Calyptraeidae  is a protandrous snail that lives in semi permanent stacks of both males and females   Previous lab and field studies have shown that males change sex faster and at a smaller size when in isolation than when the males are associated with females   Additionally  the size advantage model is more accurate within stacks than within a whole population  and males change sex at a larger size than predicted by theory   These results indicate that sex change in males is affected by conspecific interactions   However  the mechanism connecting conspecifics and sex change is unknown   I present results of an experiment that investigated the rate of sex change in C  fornicata when males were isolated  in physical and chemical contact with females  and in chemical contact only   Males only in chemical contact with females change sex at a similar rate to isolated males  suggesting that sex change is mediated by contact cues in this species   Results indicate that the relevant cue in C  fornicata is an inhibitor of sex change and that it requires physical contact with a live animal   This work provides a mechanism to explain the phenomenon of larger males than predicted by theory   It also allows for both further chemical characterization of the sex change cue and further investigation of the assumptions and parameters of the size advantage model in C  fornicata  
Rapid speciation along a genetic continuum in a neo XY bark beetle  The evolution of reproductive isolation represents a crucial link between evolution within populations  anagenesis  and the formation of new species  cladogenesis   Conceptually  understanding this fundamental problem requires linking population and quantitative genetics with the traditionally disparate fields of phylogenetics and systematics  Here  we describe research on the mountain pine beetle  Dendroctonus ponderosae  that is in the early stages of speciation and demonstrates characteristics of a ring species around the Great Basin Desert in western North America  Using a combination of crossing experiments  whole genome sequencing  Restriction Associated DNA sequencing  RAD seq   and transcriptomics  we describe a series of male specific hybrid incompatibilities that ratchet up in severity between increasingly genetically and geographically divergent populations  Crosses between populations close to a geographic boundary where incompatibilities first manifest show weak unidirectional hybrid male sterility  while the most genetically distant crosses exhibit strong bi directional hybrid male sterility and weak unidirectional hybrid male inviability  Thus  this system presents a unique progression of hybrid incompatibilities usually observed over much deeper evolutionary time scales  To understand the evolution of reproductive isolation we analyzed whole genome sequences from 14 beetles  7 males and 7 females  sampled from across their range  Phylogenetic analysis of complete mtDNA genomes revealed no phylogeographic resolution among reproductively isolated populations  Consistent with this  we also found only partial correspondence between genetic structure across most of the nuclear genome and overall patterns of reproductive isolation  Rather  patterns of nuclear divergence more closely follow a pattern of simple isolation by distance   The mountain pine beetle possesses neo XY chromosomes and to explore their potential role in the evolution of reproductive isolation  we computationally identified Y linked  X linked  and autosomal regions of the genome  We found extensive degeneration of Y linked regions with multiple deletions spanning over a megabase of the neo Y that are polymorphic across the mountain pine beetle s range  Strikingly  these deletions show a close correspondence with patterns of hybrid male sterility  Expanded population level sampling using RAD seq confirms that these deletions appear fixed between populations that generate sterile hybrid males  To determine the potential functional role of these Y linked deletions  we generated genome wide expression data  RNA seq  from beetle heads  ovaries and testes  We identified multiple testis specific transcripts within the deleted neo Y regions  suggesting that these deletions may underlie reproductive problems in hybrid males  Our results reveal rapid speciation in its earliest stages by combining genetics  genomics and phylogeography to better understand the processes that generate biodiversity   Barbara Bentz  Carried out the crosses involving the most genetically divergent cross pair  Jeffrey Good  Served as mentor and helped conceive of the whole genome sequencing  RNAseq  and RADseq experiments and their analysis  
The evolutionary genetics of shape variation in penis bones  The evolutionary genetics of shape variation in penis bones  Nicholas Schultz  Jesse Ingels  Lu Lu  Rob Williams  and Matthew D  Dean  The baculum  a bone that occurs in the penis of many mammals  is one of the fastest evolving morphological features known   Aside from its utility as a taxonomic marker  our understanding of its form and function has suffered from a lack of adequate methodology for studying landmark free shapes in three dimensions   Here we develop novel morphometric methods to study baculum variation across the  BxD  recombinant inbred panel of mice   We find that baculum shape variation has a genetic basis  with heritability>0 4   A single quantitative trait locus was mapped to chromosome 16  and we discuss possible candidate genes in the region   This study is a significant step forwards towards understanding the evolution of male genitalia     
The breakdown of self incompatibility in a range expansion  Self incompatibility  SI  is a crucial and effective mechanism to avoid self fertilization in flowering plants  It helps to prevent the negative effects of inbreeding and it has evolved several times  The SI mating recognition system is usually encoded by one locus  the S locus  with numerous alleles that are maintained by negative frequency dependent selection  Inbreeding depression is probably the main factor avoiding the invasion of self compatibility  SC   given that selfers have an automatic advantage over outcrossers  Previous theoretical studies have shown that a reduction of inbreeding depression and mate availability  i e  low number of S alleles  will facilitate the breakdown of SI and therefore the invasion of SC  During a range expansion  a series of founder events  we could expect that SC might be favoured by increasing selection for reproductive assurance  However  we still do not know what ecological and evolutionary conditions are needed for the breakdown of SI in a range expansion  Here  we develop a spatially explict individual based simulation model of a 2D range expansions to explore this and other questions related to the breakdown of SI and the roles of purifying and balancing selection on the evolution of plant mating systems  
Physiological adaptation of thermal sensitivity of Colias larvae in response to climate change  Understanding how local adaptation affects a population s ability to respond to novel thermal regimes is increasingly important given recent climate change We studied the temperature dependence  thermal performance curves  TPCs  of larval feeding rate for two populations each of Colias eurytheme and Colias eriphyle in North America that occur over a range of elevations and climates  Using historical data for two of the populations  we assessed changes over time in both climatic  Tair  conditions and TPCs for larval feeding  Populations at lower elevations with longer growing seasons had broader TPCs for larval feeding  In contrast  higher elevation populations with shorter growing seasons had higher optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding  Overall mean air temperatures during the growing season showed little change at the two sites  but the frequency of high air temperatures  >28¡C  has increased markedly at both sites over the past 40 years   This climatic shift was associated with increased rates of larval feeding at higher temperatures  >28¡C  in both populations  These results suggest that recent climate warming has led to physiological shifts in the TPCs for larval feeding in this system  implicating larval thermal adaptation as an important response that may ameliorate the fitness consequences of rapid climate change in insects  
Dispersal transiently alters the expression of immune related genes in male rhesus macaques  Macaca mulatta   Dispersal is a challenging transition in a male rhesus macaque s life history  associated with the stress of losing past social ties  forming new ones  extended periods of solitude  and usually becoming the lowest ranking male in a new social group  The stress associated with dispersal may therefore be reflected in lasting physiological differences between pre  and post dispersal animals  Alternatively  if male macaques have evolved to be resilient to dispersal related stress a normal component of rhesus macaque life history dispersal may produce only transiently experienced physiological costs  Here  we investigated changes in genome wide gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between pre  and post natal dispersal male rhesus macaques  members of a well studied free ranging population on the island of Cayo Santiago  We identified no significant differences between pre  and post dispersal males  suggesting no long term gene regulatory signature of dispersal  Instead  we found a strong signature of a short term effect of dispersal on the expression of 3 6   317 8 909  of the genes that we measured  Specifically  males sampled close to  within 300 days of  natal dispersal exhibited changes in expression of genes involved in the immune response  consistent with immunomodulatory effects of elevated glucocorticoids and testosterone  Our findings suggest that dispersal bears immunological costs detectable on the level of gene regulation  but that male macaques can recover from these costs during more stable periods of their life history   
Genomic evidence for reduced sexual selection in plumage dichromatic birds  Sexual dichromatism   the tendency for sexes to differ in colour pattern   represents a striking form of within species morphological variation  Conspicuous intersexual differences in colour pattern are generally thought to result from Darwinian sexual selection  to the extent that dichromatism is often treated as a surrogate for the intensity of sexual selection in phylogenetic comparative studies  Some evidence suggests that sexual dichromatism is correlated with social mating system in birds  but little direct evidence links the intensity of sexual selection to the magnitude of sexual dichromatism  Here  we show that the genomic signature of sexual selection is greater in avian species that lack pronounced intersexual plumage differences  We compared levels of genetic variation on sex chromosomes and autosomes in matched pairs of dimorphic and monomorphic bird species  Analyses of  900 000 restriction site associated loci from each of 24 individual birds demonstrates that monomorphic species show a consistent reduction in sex linked genomic variation relative to closely related dimorphic species  This implies greater variance in male reproductive success   and more intense sexual selection   within those species lacking conspicuous intersexual plumage differences  These results challenge assumptions about the primacy of sexual selection in driving intraspecific color differences in birds  
The population genetics of evolving games  Evolutionary game theory provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the behavior of rational agents  by encoding behavior in terms of strategies  and the results of interactions between players in terms of payoffs  However  the population genetics of even the simplest iterated games can be hard to analyze  owing to the complex and often counter intuitive relationship between the payoffs players receive  and the strategies present in a population  Here we present results on the evolution of iterated games in finite populations  We identify all subsets of memory 1 strategies that are globally stable against being selectively invaded by any other strategy  in arbitrary two player games  We show that such strategies dominate evolutionary dynamics when evolution occurs on the full set of memory 1 strategies  and we predict the relative abundancies of different strategy types at equilibrium  Finally  we employ these results to explore the evolution of cooperation when payoffs  in the form of costs and benefits  and strategies are allowed to co evolve  We find that co evolution between payoffs and strategies can often precipitate a dramatic collapse of cooperation  in which populations evolve towards payoff schemes that promote low levels of cooperation  and low average payoffs for all players  
Gene expression dynamics in a hibernating primate  Extant mammals display a vast array of morphological characteristics  behavioral responses  and physiological traits  These apparent differences between taxa offer fascinating tools for investigations into the evolutionary dynamics that give rise to the panoply of mammalian species seen today  Contemporary comparative evolutionary analyses provide considerable potential to answer questions regarding the evolutionary forces shaping complex phenotypic adaptations  such as hibernation   In recent years we have witnessed how the study of the molecular processes involved in mammalian hibernation has shifted from investigating a few carefully selected candidate genes to performing large scale differential gene expression analysis  Currently  the use of next generation high throughput transcriptome sequencing  RNA Seq  provides a global  unbiased view of how genes function in concert to regulate hibernation behavior   To date  much work has been accomplished to illuminate the means by which differential gene expression is involved in the switch from a summer active phenotype to a winter hibernation phenotype in some of the most well studied hibernating species including ground squirrels  Spermophilus spp    American black bears  Ursus americanus   and little brown bats  Myotis lucifugus   however  there is a significant knowledge gap concerning the underlying genetic mechanisms that govern hibernation in the only primates known to naturally exhibit hibernation behavior  the dwarf lemurs  Genus Cheirogaleus  endemic to Madagascar   This study aims to elucidate differential gene expression dynamics in white adipose tissue from four captive C  medius housed at the Duke Lemur Center  To that end  we used next generation transcriptome sequencing from sample collected at three time points throughout the year  which resulted in over 300 million reads  Our downstream analyses uncovers that over 300 genes show differential expression levels between the active and hibernation state in dwarf lemurs  In addition  we find that pathways involved in oxidation of fatty acids were enriched during hibernation when compared with the active state  By applying next generation sequencing approaches to a non traditional primate model system  we have the capability to investigate intriguing evolutionary questions that were previously intractable  
Phylogeography and speciation of Pitcairnia flammea  Bromeliaceae  adapted to Neotropical rock outcrops  In Neotropics the isolation and ancient age of the rock outcrops is reflected in the high number of endemic species  Because of their fragmented nature  species adapted to rock outcrops are interesting models for studying the evolutionary consequences of limited gene flow among disjoint populations  Pitcairnia flammea  Bromeliaceae  is adapted to rock outcrops  inselbergs   within the Atlantic rainforest  This wide range species possess huge morphological variability with at least seven recognized varieties occurring in allopatry and or sympatry  The divergence time of these lineages  demographic events that shaped the contemporary genetic structure  and patterns of gene flow among the naturally fragmented populations  were investigated by characterizing the population genetic structure revealed by uni and biparental molecular markers  We observed a latitudinal gradient in genetic diversity from south to north of the species distribution  This pattern is in opposite to observed for dwelling forest species in the same geographical region  P  flammea populations are genetically structured  suggesting restricted pollen and seed dispersal  and consequently strong role of drift in evolutionary history of these naturally fragmented populations  We identified bottlenecks in recent past for all populations studied  These results indicate the Neotropics has a mosaic of patterns pointing to highly complex processes responsible for its astonishing species diversity  Financial Support  FAPESP  CNPq  CAPES 
Genomic tests of Pleistocene aggregate island complexes as drivers of divergence  differentiation across local geographic scales in Caribbean crickets  Sea level oscillations between Pleistocene glacial maxima and interglacial periods have caused repeated cycles of island connections and isolation in many archipelagos  In the Caribbean  the coalescing island paradigm has been applied to explain diversification patterns that formed during the Miocene or the Pliocene  However  tests of recent population divergence across Pleistocene aggregate island complexes are still lacking  reflecting the limited resolution of traditional markers used in phylogeography  mtDNA or a few microsatellite loci  to distinguish among alternative evolutionary scenarios in such recent and dynamic systems  Harnessing the power of genomic scans  we estimate fine scale biogeographic affinities among the Caribbean Virgin Islands   an archipelago with a history of repeated island reconnections during the Pleistocene  providing an ideal system to study genetic divergence due to sea level oscillations  over short geographic distances and uniform climatic conditions  Specifically  with an average of 37 000 SNPs from the genome of 136 individuals from ten populations of an endemic flightless ground cricket species  Amphiacusta sanctaecrucis  we assess genetic differentiation and reconstruct population histories to make inferences about population connections and persistence in this geologically dynamic system  Despite the recent island connections fostered by sea level changes and the small geographic scale separating islands  we nonetheless find high levels of population divergence with largely discrete genetic clusters on each present day island and a strong geographic structure across the archipelago  We infer a stepping stone pattern of colonization with long term population persistence on most of the present day islands  including the smaller islets  However  the genomic data supports a model involving an over sea colonization of Saint Croix  the only island that has been disconnected since at least the Pliocene  and a strong population bottleneck on the coral atoll of Anegada  We discuss these findings in the broader context of Caribbean biogeography and the role of Pleistocene aggregate island complexes as drivers of divergence across local geographic scales  
An experimental test of the causal mechanisms linking flowering time to male fitness in a hermaphroditic annual plant  Individuals of sexual species accrue fitness by producing  female role  or siring  male role  offspring  Understanding trait evolution requires that the targets and agents of selection be identified for both gender roles  We aimed to understand how and why selection acts on flowering time in Brassica rapa  As for most plant traits  little is known about selection on flowering time through male fitness  but both direct and indirect selection are possible  The latter may include indirect effects through phenotype environment correlation with the social environment  quantity and quality of conspecifics  or with the non social environment  pollinators  florivores  abiotic stress  etc   experienced during flowering  To tease apart these effects  we manipulated the correlation between age at flowering  AAF   i e   flowering time  and flowering Julian Date  FJD   i e   non social environment   Specifically  we staggered planting dates to create populations in which AAF and FJD were positively  negatively  or uncorrelated  Genetic paternity analysis revealed that direct selection strongly favoured young AAF in two populations  and tended towards the same in the third  Decreasing male success with older AAF  regardless of FJD  suggests indirect selection through correlation with the non social environment was weak  To assess effects of correlation with the social environment  we repeated paternity analysis using seeds sampled uniformly across mothers  This sampling eliminated variance in dam quality  and thus  covariance between sire AAF and dam quality  Selection gradients estimated from the uniform sample matched those estimated by the previous  proportional  sample  suggesting selection through correlation with the social environment was also weak  Finally  to explore the direct effect of flowering time on male fitness  we conducted path analysis of AAF and correlated traits on four multiplicative fitness components  In all populations  older AAF led to fewer mates reached per flower  Thus it seems that AAF  or an unmeasured  genetically correlated trait  directly affected attractiveness to pollinators and or efficiency of pollen transfer to pollinator bodies  We previously reported that selection through female fitness in this experiment tended to favour early FJD  regardless of AAF  Taking the positive correlation between AAF and FJD to be the closest approximation of a natural population  we infer that early flowering likely enhances both male and female function in B  rapa  but for different reasons  This mechanistic difference has evolutionary consequences  selection to maintain optimal AAF for male function could slow response to selection on FJD through female function in a changing environment  
Local adaptation in herbivore feeding preferences  a marine terrestrial contrast  Herbivorous insects tend to specialize on a subset of available host plants  and this specialization appears correlated with high rates of local adaptation and adaptive radiation    A focus on specialist insects  however  comes at the expense of a broader understanding of the evolutionary ecology of the many ecologically important herbivores with more generalist diets   As an example  the dearth of studies on local adaptation in generalist herbivores suggests that generalists rarely locally adapt    We tested this hypothesis over the past decade with marine herbivores  most of whom have highly generalist diets   We find that crustacean and echinoderm herbivores routinely adapt to local seaweed diets  and in particular  to seaweed chemical defenses  The consistency by which marine generalists adapt to local seaweeds suggest that terrestrial generalist herbivores should locally adapt at higher frequently than is currently appreciated    
Molecular phylogeny and historical biogeographic reconstructions onto shifting continents in the cockles and giant clams  Bivalvia  Cardiidae   Reconstructing historical biogeography of the marine realm is complicated by indistinct barriers and over the deeper time scales relevant to major clades  a dynamic landscape due to plate tectonics   Here we report a large scale synoptic phylogeny for the marine bivalve family Cardiidae  cockles and giant clams  and an examination of patterns of diversification across the marine realm  We analyzed nuclear Histone 3 and 28S and mitochondrial 16S for 110 species representing 37 of the 44 recognized genera and all eight extant subfamilies  Lineage divergence times were estimated using a Bayesian approach and 13 well documented fossil calibrations  Ancestral geographic ranges and range expansions dispersals were reconstructed using the dispersal extinction cladegenesis  DEC  method with a stratified paleogeographic model in which dispersal rates were scaled according to area connectivity  with this connectivity varying according to shifting tectonics across three time slices  The resulting topologies are compared to previous anatomical and molecular findings  We confirm the monophyly of only two subfamilies  Tridacninae  giant clams  and Clinocardiinae  and found rampant paraphyly polyphyly in the other six subfamilies  The Cardiidae seem to have originated in the tropical Indo Pacific some time in the early Cretaceous and diversified within the tropical Pacific  The extant diversity seen in the Atlantic is derived from species that dispersed from the tropical Indo Mediterranean region during the Cenozoic via the Tethys Sea  Contrary to some other clades  the western Atlantic fauna are derived from Indo Pacific clades rather than western Atlantic  despite a narrower Atlantic during the dispersal events  Finally  we test the accuracy of DEC biogeographic reconstructions with the extensive fossil record of these clades  
Teams of Transcription Factors are rewired in the evolution of Ascomycota fungi  The upstream regulator of a group of functionally linked and co regulated genes  a group known as a regulon  sometimes changes in related species  Nonetheless function and expression of the orthologous gene group across those Species is conserved  Specific cases of such transcriptional network rewiring have been characterized  but there are likely to be many more instances than have been reported so far  For example  it has been reported that Rap1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae substituted Tbf1 Cbf1 in Candida albicans for ribosomal RP genes  A systematic computational approach to detect transcriptional network rewiring is needed to gain insight into evolutionary mechanisms as well as to interpret experimental results in related model organisms   We develop a novel computational technique to detect rewiring of transcriptional networks where the Transcription Factor  TF  regulating a set of genes is replaced by another TF during evolution   Our method is applied to evolutionarily conserved co expressed gene groups across 23 yeast species for 126 TFs  Our dataset of Species includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Candida albicans and Ashbya gossypii   The last one is economically important pathogen of cotton  Our method successfully detects TF substitution for the ribosomal RP regulon consisting of ribosomal RP genes  It is intriguing that sometimes a group of TFs appears to be switched with a second group of TFs for a group of genes   Then  we use our technique to answer a question  Can a group or  team  of Transcription Factors  TFs  switch with another team of TFs for a collection of related genes in related Species through evolution  For a group of 30 RP genes  our method finds a team of six TFs that collectively switch with another team of six other TFs for 10 most recently evolutionary diverged Species after the Whole Genome Duplication  WGD  event  In another example  for a  Regulation of Growth  gene  we find a team of three TFs that collectively switch with another team of five other TFs for the same 10 Species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae  We can estimate the time of the switch to be 100 million of years ago  the estimated time when the WGD occurred  
Population genomics of two ecologically disparate Fundulus hybrid zones   An earlier survey of ten replicate topminnow  Fundulus olivaceus and F  notatus  hybrid zones revealed that the species were typically distributed in an upstream downstream manner with contact zones localized at confluences featuring abrupt shifts from tributary to river habitat  The rate of hybridization among drainages ranged from no hybrids in two drainages to near random mating in others  The best predictor of hybridization rate was the homogeneity of habitat through  tributary river confluences  ratio of river to tributary size   Phenotype differences between the species reflect predicted selection differences along stream gradients  Downstream populations  lower food availability and greater predator pressure  generally showed larger  investment in reproduction  higher gonadal somatic index   smaller body size and lower somatic condition compared to upstream populations  In two drainages  the species typical up and downstream positions were reversed  Phenotypic differences between the species in the two reversed drainages were consistent with convergence of life history traits in the respective habitats  We sampled the middle of two ecologically disparate hybrid zones  one typical and one reversed  and used genotyping by sequencing to generate genome wide SNP libraries  We ask whether there is a greater rate of hybridization or directional introgression in converging populations from the  reversed  hybrid zone  
Climate variability may limit evolutionary adaptation to climate change in montane and alpine butterflies  Evolutionary potential will be important for the many organisms with limited ability to track long term climate change via movement   We integrate biophysical  demographic and evolutionary models with climate data to explore selection and evolution of wing melanin on the posterior ventral hindwings in montane and alpine Colias butterflies in the Rocky Mountains  Higher levels of wing melanin increase the absorption of radiation and can dramatically increase body temperatures   The fitness surface  fitness as a function of wing melanin  has a single peak as a result of two opposing factors   wing melanin increases activity times and reproductive success in cool conditions  but can reduce egg production and adult survival due to short term overheating   Mean summer temperatures have increased at both montane and alpine sites over the past 60 years  but with substantial variation among years   As a result the location of the fitness peak varies between years  producing temporal variation in the magnitude and direction of selection  especially at montane sites   Recent and future climate warming are predicted to cause evolutionary reductions in mean wing melanin  but the evolutionary responses of montane and  alpine butterflies may be strongly limited by seasonal and annual variability in temperature and cloudiness in these regions  
Warning signal polymorphism under positive frequency dependent selection  Aposematism  whereby prey display conspicuous warning signals to advertise their unpalability to potential predators  is thought to be the only example of traits under positive frequency dependant selection  However  empirical evidence supporting this pattern of selection in natural systems is still lacking  This is in great part due to the difficulty in distinguishing whether the purifying selection observed in natural systems is the results of a linear positive frequency dependant selection or the result of a bi modal selection  where one aposematic signal is recognized and avoided  advantaged  by predators and all other signals are quickly counter selected at a similar rate independently of frequency   To differentiate between these patterns of selection  we took advantage of the mimicry polymorphism displayed in every locality by the butterfly Heliconius numata  Using malleable prey models and population genetic tools we demonstrate that within a community of educated predators  the fraction of predators having learned to avoid a given aposematic signal increases with the increasing frequency of the signal up to a given threshold whereby the highest possible fraction of predators is educated  Moreover  we show that this positive frequency dependent selection  which accelerates the loss of diversity and leads to monomorphism within populations  is nevertheless responsible for the maintenance of an outstanding diversity of aposematic signals across geography  We will present data on the maintenance of local polymorphism through positive frequency dependent selection and discuss how antagonistic selective forces can maintain diversity in warning signals   
 Macroevolution  Phylomorphospace and Directional Evolution in Burrowing Scallops   Examining patterns  modes  of change in natural systems offers the opportunity to understand how biological diversity is both created and maintained  Bivalved scallops  Pectinidae  are a particularly good system to study evolutionary patterns of morphological change  they are a speciose clade  their members display an array of shell morphologies  they are found in a wide range of habitats  and they are broadly organized into five functional groups which vary in their level of mobility  cementing  byssal attaching  recessing  free living  and long distance swimming   Previous work has shown that in scallops there is strong convergent evolution in shell shape among unrelated long distance swimming species  In this study we characterized morphological patterns of shell shape in 121 species of scallops representing lineages from differing contemporary functional groups to gain a more complete picture of the degree of morphological similarity among different functional groups  For this we combined morphological data on shell shape derived from landmark based geometric morphometric methods with a phylomorphospace approach  a phylogenetic comparative method to infer evolutionary change along branches of a phylogeny  We evaluate the predictions that the scallop morphospace is partitioned according to shell morphologies defining the five functional groups  suggesting substantial convergent evolution  Our results find species of two of the five life habits have evolved similar morphological shape from inhabiting similar environments at different geographic locations  we confirm convergent evolution of long distance swimming species  and find convergent evolution among species that are recessers  a burrowing behavior   Furthermore  out results find a striking trend of directional morphological evolution in one clade of recessers  along an axis that describes a progressively convex shell shape  Variation in shell shape among recessers is predicted to be due to functional differences in burrowing behavior  We discuss these results in terms of the implications for understanding scallop biology and evolutionary history  and more broadly  in terms of evolutionary processes driving invertebrate diversity  
The use of ultra conserved elements in resolving nightbird  Caprimulgiformes  phylogeny  A surprising finding of recent avian phylogenetics is the statistically unambiguous grouping of the diurnal order Apodiformes  swifts and hummingbirds  within the nocturnal order Caprimulgiformes  i e  nighthawks and nightjars  hereafter called  Caprimulgiformes    The pairing of the two orders in monophyly raises questions about the evolution of nocturnality in birds  especially how many times it occurred  what adaptations made it possible  and what genetic and molecular variation underlies those adaptations              Previously mentioned phylogenies reconstructed this clade with modest datasets  I have used a novel massively parallel sequencing approach to resolve the  Caprimulgiformes  phylogeny using a dataset based on the informative flanking regions of  5 000 ultra conserved element  UCE  loci  I will present analyses that seek to extract the most phylogenetic information from this dataset using currently available techniques  including efforts to assign UCE loci to functional categories  
Identification of major QTLs underlying floral pollination syndrome divergence in Penstemon  Distinct floral pollination syndromes have emerged multiple times during the diversification of flowering plants  For example  in western North America  a hummingbird pollination syndrome has evolved more than one hundred times  generally from within insect pollinated lineages  The hummingbird syndrome is characterized by a suite of floral traits that attracts and facilitates pollen movement by hummingbirds  while at the same time discourages bee visitation  These floral traits include large nectar volume  red flower color  elongated and narrow corolla tubes and reproductive organs that are exerted from the corolla  A handful of studies have examined the genetic architecture of hummingbird pollination syndrome evolution  These studies find that mutations of relatively large effect often explain increased nectar volume and transition to red flower color  In addition  they suggest that adaptive suites of floral traits may often exhibit a high degree of genetic linkage  which could facilitate their fixation during pollination syndrome evolution  We explored these emerging generalities by investigating the genetic basis of floral pollination syndrome divergence between two related Penstemon species with different pollination syndromes   bee pollinated P  neomexicanus and closely related hummingbird pollinated P  barbatus  In an F2 mapping population derived from a cross between these two species  we characterized the effect size of genetic loci underlying floral trait divergence associated with the transition to bird pollination  as well as correlation structure of floral trait variation   We find the effect sizes of QTLs for adaptive floral traits are in line with patterns observed in previous studies  with large effect sizes observed  particularly for flower color and nectar volume  We find strong evidence that suites of floral traits are genetically linked  This linkage may be due to genetic proximity or pleiotropic effects of single causative loci  Interestingly  our data suggest that the evolution of floral traits critical for hummingbird pollination was not constrained by negative pleiotropy at loci that show co localization for multiple traits  
Host associated differentiation as a midpoint in a total host shift  Loss of adaptation to a native host in Florida soapberry bugs  Host associated differentiation is often studied with the goal of understanding the early stages of speciation   However  local adaptation to distinct hosts will not always result in the emergence of reproductive isolation  as many components of spatial  temporal  and ecological isolation and stability may contribute to gene flow in spite of strong differential local selection   The soapberry bugs  Hemiptera Rhopalidae  Serenithinae  have been well studied for their remarkably rapid  repeated adaptation to novel host plants throughout the world   In the early 1990s  Scott Carroll and colleagues demonstrated that populations of Jadera haematoloma had locally adapted to the invasive host plant golden rain tree  Koelreuteria elegans  in Florida after its introduction and spread in the mid 1990s  and that a trade off existed between ability to use the invasive and the native host  balloon vine  Cardiospermum corindum   leading to two distinct sets of host associated populations with fitness peaks on their local host   Key morphological adaptations  namely differences in beak length optimized to feed on each host  also showed clear differentiation              However  this no longer seems to be the case    Returning to these populations almost 25 years after the original work  both morphological measurements and cross rearing experiments demonstrate that populations on both hosts are now more well adapted to the invasive host plant   Compared to previous measures  populations using the invasive host appear to have changed relatively little in the past 25 years   However  populations on the native host are now very similar to those on the invasive host morphologically and have similar survival when reared on the invasive host   When reared on the native host  all populations show dramatically reduced survival  but populations from the native host still out perform those on the invasive host  Although what has driven this loss of local adaptation has not yet been explicitly studied  it seems likely that the much larger populations supported by the invasive host  and their expansion since its introduction  have contributed to increased gene flow swamping out adaptation to the native host   Given the variable nature of host abundance and stability in many systems in the field  this should serve as a cautionary tale to those of us interested in extrapolating from local adaptation to speciation   
The Evolution and Ecology of Ant Gut Microbiomes Molecular methods are revealing how endosymbiotic bacteria have facilitated the origins and maintenance of herbivory across the ants   Using next generation sequencing to uncover ant microbial community diversity we are testing the association of gut bacteria with host phylogeny and host trophic ecology using stable isotopes to determine whether the stability and composition of gut communities can be explained by shared evolutionary history or trophic level  These findings demonstrate that herbivorous ants have a stable and diverse gut microbiome which likely facilitated their shift to a herbivorous diet  
Do additional functional demands promote or inhibit morphological diversification   A test on turtle shells  There is currently little consensus regarding the degree to which functional demands  in particular the number of different functions that a given structure performs  are expected to influence the morphological diversification of structures   Classically  the view has been that additional functions would carry with them additional functional constraints  and that the need to compromise among those constraints would lead to decreased phenotypic diversification   More recent work involving the evolution of simulated clades  suggests in contrast that additional functions expand Pareto fronts  permitting clades to diversify within an expanded region of morphospace  depending on the relative selective pressures for performance on different functions   Empirical support is available for both views  raising the possibility that the effect of additional functions may be affected by additional factors   Here  I test the possibility that the shape of the performance landscape can have a major influence on the effects of additional functional demands on subsequent morphological diversification   In particular  I focus on whether many to one mapping of form onto functional performance is common in one or more functions   The shells of aquatic turtles evolve in response to selective pressures to increase mechanical strength  to resist predator attacks  and hydrodynamic efficiency  to reduce drag during swimming   among other selective pressures   terrestrial turtles share all of these pressures except hydrodynamic efficiency   The shells of terrestrial turtles evolve more rapidly  and with less convergence  than those of aquatic turtles  producing more overall disparity   moreover  a greater variety of shell shapes for a given level of mechanical performance is seen in terrestrial species  relative to aquatic species   These observations are more consistent with a classical view of diversification under multiple selective pressures  but more importantly  they highlight the importance of considering broad many to one mapping when predicting the influence of functional performance on diversification  besides more particularly suggesting an important role for many to one mapping during the diversification in turtle shells    Given that many to one mapping is a common phenomenon in functional morphology  this pattern is likely generalizable to many other evolving clades   However  the data also indicate the importance of Pareto optimality concepts in explaining the distributions of evolving clades   aquatic taxa seem to lie on a Pareto front defined by mechanical and hydrodynamic performance  
Interactions between host phylogeny and biogeography structure sponge associated microbial communities  Sponges  phylum Porifera  can host diverse and abundant communities of microbial symbionts that make critical contributions to host metabolism  Although observations suggest that these communities may be transferred among hosts through a combination of vertical and horizontal transmission  direct evidence of transmission is rare for most symbiotic taxa   On large scales  we predicted that vertical transmission would be correlated with host phylogeny  while horizontal transmission would be correlated with geographic location   In collaboration with the Earth Microbiome Project  EMP   we investigated whether host phylogeny  geographic location  or interactions between these factors impact symbiotic microbial community structure   We used high throughput pyrosequencing of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to assess community structure in 90 specimens representing 20 sponge species   As expected  the richness of operational taxonomic units varied significantly among host species   A significant interaction between host phylogeny and geography explained 62  of the observed variance in microbial community dissimilarity and 69  of the observed variance in microbial phylogenetic dissimilarity  suggesting that interactions between vertical and horizontal transmission play a major role in structuring these symbiotic communities  
Ecological Diversification of Vibrio fischeri During the Planktonic Phase   Subsequent Consequences for Squid Host Colonization  Stable microcosm experiments with bacteria have become model systems for studying microbial ecological diversification  whereby standing liquid cultures founded by planktonic  water column inhabiting cells that form smooth colonies  smooth morphs  on agar plates differentiate into alternative types due to resource competition as a result of mutations  These variant cell types can either establish pellicle and or benthic populations in structured  undisturbed  and heterogeneous microcosms  When grown on agar plates  the derived cell types can form wrinkled and fuzzy colonies  wrinkly spreaders and fuzzy spreaders   Bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae are gram negative bacteria living in marine and brackish waters as planktonic cells and biofilms attached to abiotic surfaces or eukaryotic host cells  In particular  Vibrio fischeri is a marine bioluminescent microbe that exists mutualistically with sepiolid squids and monocentrid fishes  Although V  fischeri has been well studied as a beneficial bacterium during host colonization  adaptive radiation during the free living phase due to mutations and the accompanying effects on animal host colonization are poorly understood  V  fischeri wrinkly spreaders that evolve in stable microcosms as free living cells are competitively superior during squid colonization relative to their smooth morph ancestors  indicating that simple de novo mutations can significantly affect symbiosis  Understanding how bacteria are capable of adapting to fluctuating conditions in the environment may provide insight to how organisms accommodate these changes to their dual life history between planktonic and symbiotic states  
 Cardiac Myopathy in Starvation Selected Drosophila  or The Case of the All American Flies   Previous studies have shown that selection for starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster results in populations that are extremely obese   We used high speed videography and optical coherence tomography to investigate correlated changes in cardiac function   Hearts of starvation selected flies had wider systolic and diastolic diameters and a smaller fractional shortening ratio  resulting in reduced cardiac output relative to fed control populations   These flies exhibited low locomotor activity and flew poorly  due to increased wing loading   To investigate whether these phenotypes were genetically based  we made adult starvation selected flies lean by withholding food for seven days   We also limited access to food late in the third larval instar  when excess lipids are accumulated   After either of these diets  the flies had the same mass and lipid content as controls   Cardiac parameters and flight performance were similar to those of control flies  indicating that the seven day diet rescued these phenotypes   Our data are consistent with a model in which large lipid deposits cause a dilated cardiomyopathy   Thus  correlated responses to selection appear to be caused by physical interference with the heart rather than genetic differences in cardiac physiology   Supported by NIH award R15 GM100395  
Locating a selection signature inside chromosomal rearrangements for tests of adaptive divergence in Anopheles gambiae  As the primary malaria vector that is widely distributed in sub Sahara  Anopheles gambiae s  str  utilizes many different microhabitats where human reside  Its fast adaptation is partly attributed to polymorphic inversions within or between populations in the species  Theory predicts that large paracentric inversions  which do not directly affect individual fitness  can facilitate local adaptation by suppressing recombination among co adapted genes captured by inversions  While stable clines and associations between inversions and specific environmental factors are suggestive of causal relationships  finding specific gene or regions which confer the fitness advantage of the inversions is difficult because of high levels of linkage disequilibrium and or low nuclear diversity within young inversions   In this study  wild mosquito samples were collected from five populations in transitional ecozones between forest and savanna in Cameroon and genome wide SNPs identified from barcoded Rad sequencing  Departure from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium of two common polymorphic inversions  2La and 2Rb  suggests the existence of divergent selection in different habitats  with the inverted chromosomes predominating in dry habitats and the standard chromosomes in wet habitats  Fst comparisons showed that within inverted regions  i  Fst  average 0 4 0 5  is significantly higher than collinear regions   
Phylogenomics of deep sea octocorals  new approaches to solve long standing problems  The sub class Octocorallia  is one of the least studied groups within the phylum Cnidaria  In general  the taxonomy  phylogenetic relationships and population level variability within this group are poorly understood  Morphologically based species identification and classification are extremely challenging for non specialists  and are difficult to replicate among taxonomists  Variations in octocoral colony architecture and micro skeletal structures have been historically used as diagnostic characters  Studies over the last 15 years have shown that many of these morphological traits keep little to no correspondence with the patterns of relatedness inferred using low variability mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequence markers  As such  these traditional molecular markers have been remarkably insufficient to resolve relationships at all taxonomic levels within the octocorals  These have been long standing problems with no solution  leaving fundamental questions regarding species differentiation  classification  and biogeography of cold water octocorals unresolved              Recent technical advances allow the implementation of next generation sequencing technologies for the rapid detection and genotyping of genome wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms  SNPs  in non model organisms  These technologies open a new frontier in molecular studies  not only providing rich information for species identifications and taxonomy  but also the promise of providing profound insights into the population genomics  phylogeography  and evolution of deep sea species              We employed Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing  RAD seq  to identify SNPs in individuals from 13 putative octocoral coral species from the clade of families Paragorgiidae  Corallidae  and Alcyoniidae  Through phylogenomic analyses we produced a completely resolved and well supported evolutionary tree for the group  which spans divergence times greater than 50 million years  Our approach demonstrates the great potential of RAD seq for untangling the genetic relationships of deep sea organisms  particularly those that have traditionally been difficult to study due to low levels of genetic variation  
Condition dependent alternative reproductive tactics in territorial damselflies  the role of wing shape in territory holding potential  Territorial contests between males without weaponry are based on costly displays and can result in condition dependent alternative reproductive tactics that maximize male fitness  Physiological and morphological traits such as fat content  body size or the expression of secondary sexual traits have been shown to contribute to male territory holding potential  When territorial contests are based on flight displays  wing shape is expected to contribute to the territory holding potential of a male through its effects on flight performance  We explored whether wing shape contributed to the territory holding potential of males of three species of Calopteryx damselflies  Males of these species show two distinct  condition dependent behavioral tactics  territorial and nonterritorial  Previous studies have shown that territorial males have higher fitness than nonterritorial males  We used mark recapture to determine male tactics within the populations and compared wing shape  size and wing colored spot size  a secondary sexual trait  between tactics  Territorial males of all three species had shorter and slightly broader hindwings than nonterritorial males  In two species  forewings of territorial males were longer and broader than forewings of nonterritorial males  Wing size and wing spot size did not differ between tactics  We suggest that the wing shape of territorial males might confer better flight maneuverability  which would be advantageous for territorial contests  Therefore  wing shape is likely to be an important trait contributing to territory holding potential in condition dependent alternative reproductive tactics based on flight displays  
Where are all old fungal ectomycorrhizal lineages   Ectomycorrhiza  ECM  is a root associated symbiosis between plants and fungi where the plant gets nutrients in return for energy rich carbon compounds  Most boreal and many temperate and tropical stand forming trees are depending on ECM and so are many iconic mushrooms such as the fly agaric  king bolete  truffle  and matsutake  Pinaceae is the putatively oldest ECM plant clade  It has been dated to have originated in the Jurassic  or Early Cretaceous  In contrast estimates of fungal ECM lineages tend to be much younger  with origins in the Late Cretaceous or Eocene  >90  of the fungal ECM species belong to Agaricomycotina  Here I attempt to date all ECM lineages in this clade using relaxed molecular clock dating to look for older lineages  
Sexual co adaptation or conflict  Are genes that interact with the mitochondria more often on the sex chromosomes   Asymmetrical inheritance patterns have the potential to invoke intra genomic co adaptation or conflict between females and males  In contrast with autosomal genes  which are inherited equally from both parents  mitochondria are only transmitted through the maternal line  and are selected primarily for female effects  Sex chromosomes  on the other hand  are either female biased  the X  or male biased  the Z  in their transmission  and this creates the potential for sex specific intra genomic conflict or co adaptation dynamics between the sex chromosomes and cytonuclear genomes  Nuclear genes that interact with the mitochondria  mito nuclear genes  may move onto or off of the sex chromosomes  depending upon whether co adaptation or conflict dominates  resulting in non random distributions of mito nuclear genes  We explored the genomic distribution of mito nuclear genes in multiple species with independently evolved sex chromosomes across a broad array of animals  Although therian mammals and C  elegans showed a deficit of mito nuclear genes on the X chromosomes consistent with sexual conflict  other independent X chromosomes lacked significant deficits  and there was no converse over abundance of mito nuclear genes on Z chromosomes   Our findings suggest that sexual intra genomic conflict does not broadly explain the distribution of mito nuclear genes  and we suggest other potential causes related to haploid selection and sperm biology that may explain these observations   
Clustering Genes by Phylogenetic Similarity  The abundance of sequence data due to high throughput sequencing has the potential to make phylogenetic inference more accurate by enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple loci to be used in constructing a tree  However  if the loci do not share the same history  due to events such as horizontal gene transfer  it can be misleading to describe the entire data set by a single tree  We propose a system by which data can be described by multiple trees  potentially aiding the discovery of distinct evolutionary histories  Our method  treeCl  partitions a set of sequence alignments into one or more classes  where each class represents a distinct phylogenetic history and comprises the loci that share that history  The method is  process agnostic  in that no specific model of the biological processes causing evolutionary heterogeneity is assumed  and so escapes biases that may affect approaches that assume particular mechanisms of non congruent evolution  I present a survey of clustering methods by which the partitioning can be achieved  show how the quality of the results can be assessed by maximum likelihood  and use a series of simulation experiments to rank the methods  I also show a means of searching the partition space to optimise the partition for a fixed number of classes  Also included in treeCl are ways of visualising distributions of trees in tree space  which can be used to indicate whether a dataset is a candidate for phylogenetic partitioning  and a statistical means of determining the optimum number of classes  In an example study  I apply the method to a set of 344 proteins from 18 yeast species and identify a subset of genes whose evolutionary history departs from the species tree in the placement of a single species  This may be related to a whole genome duplication in yeast  
The extremes of toxin expression variation revealed in two sympatric snake species  The proteomic content of snake venoms determines their efficacy in feeding and defense and therefore the fitness of the animals wielding them  Optimization of venom for local prey species could proceed through qualitative changes  such as fixation of new alleles  or through quantitative changes in the amounts of particular venom components by means of changes in gene expression or post transcriptional regulation  We investigated the prevalence of expression variation by characterizing range wide patterns of proteomic variation in the venoms of two sympatric species  the eastern diamondback rattlesnake  Crotalus adamanteus  and the eastern coral snake  Micrurus fulvius   For each species  we constructed a genotype phenotype map between the venom gland transcriptome and the venom proteome to link expression differences to specific gene sequences  We then analyzed the contents of hundreds of individual venom samples  Not unexpectedly  geographic variation in expression patterns was detectable and extensive for C  adamanteus  We also detected significant ontogenetic variation and geographic patterns in both adult and juvenile venoms  In contrast  Micrurus fulvius showed no evidence for variation of any kind in their venoms  
Rapid evolution of reproductive isolation between outcrossing and selfing subspecies of Clarkia xantiana  Speciation requires the evolution of reproductive isolating  RI  barriers that prevent hybridization between diverging lineages  Mating system transitions  specifically from outcrossing to selfing  are common in plant speciation but the contribution of shifts in mating system to reproductive isolation of diverging taxa has not been well studied   In this study  we documented the sequential components of pre mating and post mating RI between two recently diverged  ca  65 000 years bp  Clarkia subspecies that have diverged in mating system and have come into secondary contact  C  xantiana xantiana and C  xantiana parviflora  We found that the two taxa are nearly completely isolated and that pre mating barriers  specifically flowering phenology and pollinator preference  for the outcrosser over the selfer   contribute most to RI between the taxa  We also discovered a substantial and asymmetric crossing barrier despite the fact that the lineages have very recently diverged  There was no evidence that pollen pistil interactions contribute to RI  Instead  hybrid inviability occurs during seed development and is not observed in later stages of hybrid development  
Assessing the Polyploid origin of the genus Erythrina  Fabaceae   Commonly known as Coral Trees  Erythrina is a pantropical genus comprising  130 species and is of polyploid origin   Their striking inflorescences and flowers have lead to a wide use of several species in the horticultural industry where they are planted as street and park trees   The genus also boasts several chemical properties currently being investigated for anti anxiety and anti malarial properties   These same compounds are used  recreationally  as hallucinogens  often with fatal consequences   To estimate the timing of polyploidy we sequenced the transcriptome of 2 Erythrina species spanning the evolutionary breadth of the genus using 454 pyrosequencing   We also sequenced the winged bean  Psophocarpus tetragonolobus  as an outgroup   We used the distribution of Ks for paralogous gene pairs created by polyploidy to help bound the time of polyploidization   Our results suggested that progenitor genomes diverged around 14 mya   To further bound this  we used the same method to estimate divergence times between the two Erythrina species as well as each species to Psophocarpus   We conclude that polyploidy took place between 5 and 15 mya in an ancestoral lineage  preceeding the radiation of the genus Erythrina   
Divergence in life cycle associated with variation in circadian genes in the European corn borer  Many species in temperate climates show latitudinal variation in life cycle corresponding to synchronization with seasonal fluctuations in resources   In particular  insects often vary clinally in voltinism  the number of generations per year  which is determined by the timing of diapause release   These phenotypic gradients in life cycle have rarely been linked to genetic variation at specific loci   We studied genetic variation along a latitudinal cline in the European corn borer  Ostrinia nubilalis   which varies in the number of generations per season in the United States  from one generation in the north to three in the south   We found that voltinism is closely associated with allelic variation in cryptochrome  a gene in the circadian clock pathway   Period  another circadian gene  showed a sawtooth cline and varied both among voltinism types and within the bivoltine type   Our study suggests that these circadian genes are key to seasonal timing and may be involved in variation in diapause termination  traits which are associated with temporal isolation between Ostrinia strains  
  Fitness  has at least three incommensurable dimensions   growth  efficiency  and competitiveness   Evolutionary biology  fitness  can be defined either in relative terms  normalized to the competition  or against an external standard  Many binary distinctions have been made between different kinds of fitness  not only absolute vs  relative fitness  but also r  vs  K selection  natural vs  sexual selection  density dependent vs  independent  selection on individuals vs  groups  and hard vs  soft selection  I propose a new formulation of the concept of biological fitness  with three rather than two incommensurable fitness dimensions  subsuming these prior distinctions and resolving past problems with them  Competitiveness is normalized and unitless  while growth and efficiency are both absolute  with time and resource units respectively  
The evolution of multicellularity as a key innovation for adaptive radiation in experimental microcosms  Multicellularity is thought to play a critical role in the evolution of biological complexity  facilitating diversification by opening up new ecological opportunities  However  there is still debate on the importance of this transition driving diversification  as well as  the mechanistic ink between the evolution of multicellularity and increased rates of diversification  We examined a process of adaptive radiation following the evolution of multicellularity in the unicellular yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae   At least two lineages with distinct multicellular life histories evolved and coexisted in 9 out of 10 replicate populations  We found that the origin of novel multicellular life histories was a critical factor  increasing the complexity of the environment  The large clusters of cells altered the fluid dynamics of the environment and the evolution of different life stages allowed for exploitation of different niches  To understand the mechanism underlying this diversification  we looked at the evolutionary history of a single population in detail  and observed the rapid evolution of different multicellular life history strategies along a trade off between growth and survival  Moreover  we found that disparate multicellular life histories were capable of stable coexistence  The evolution of multicellularity profoundly changed Earth s ecological and evolutionary dynamics  Here we show that multicellularity can directly spur the evolution of not only increased biological complexity  but also its diversity  
How is geographic variation within species related to macroevolutionary patterns between species   The relationship between microevolution and macroevolution is a central topic in evolutionary biology   An aspect of this relationship that remains very poorly studied in modern evolutionary biology is the relationship between within species geographic variation and among species patterns of trait variation   We tested the relationship between climate and morphology among and within species in the salamander genus Plethodon   We focus on a discrete color polymorphism  presence and absence of a red dorsal stripe  that appears to be related to climatic distributions in a common  wide ranging species  Plethodon cinereus    We find that this polymorphism has been maintained among and within species for >40 million years   Furthermore  we find a strong relationship between climatic variation and morph frequencies among species   These between species patterns are similar  but not identical  to those in the broadly distributed Plethodon cinereus  although there is a lack of significant climate morphology relationships within other polymorphic species   Overall  our study highlights the possibility that adaptive geographic variation may be important for large scale macroevolutionary patterns  and explores one of many scenarios by which this may occur  
Deterministic Evolution in Greater Antillean Boid Snakes  an Extension of the Caribbean Ecomorph Paradigm   Some of the most important insights into the ecological and evolutionary processes of diversification  colonization  and speciation have come from studies of organisms on islands in the Caribbean  In particular  Anolis lizards are a textbook example of adaptive radiation and convergence  as the remarkable repeated evolution of convergent ecomorphs has occurred in situ on each of the Greater Antillean islands  Indeed  the ecomorph concept has been an important paradigm for examining adaptive radiation and convergent evolution of other squamates in the Caribbean  However  not all squamate groups  e g   alsophiine snakes  scincid lizards  have undergone the same degree of ecomorphological diversification despite apparent ecological opportunity  West Indian boid snakes  Chilabothrus   might represent an interesting additional extension of the ecomorph concept  though this has never been explicited investigated  This monophyletic clade of 11 nocturnal species exhibits a wide variety of ecological and gross morphological difference  occupying habitats from xeric scrub to tropical rainforest  and maximum adult body sizes ranging from less than one meter to nearly four meters  Two main morphotypes have been recognized in this genus  large bodied generalists  6 species  and small bodied specialists  5 species   Both large and small species are distributed across the range of WI boas  sometimes occurring on the same island It is clear that WI boas have radiated both ecologically and morphologically  hence we wish to examine whether this group might conform to the general ecomorph paradigm  Specifically  we test the ecomorph concept  adaptive radiation and convergent evolution  in this group by combining the first comprehensive multilocus molecular dataset for the clade with morphological measurements of an ecologically relevant structure  the head   to test  1  whether small ecotypes have evolved repeatedly in situ from large ancestors on different islands  and 2  whether these small ecotypes are morphologically convergent  
Host evolution and ecology govern community assembly of the gut microbiome in lemurs  Nearly every aspect of mammalian life is linked in some way to microbes  Bacteria promote tissue development  train the immune system  and affect host behavior  In addition  gut microbes facilitate fiber digestion thereby not only impacting nutrition across an individual s lifespan  but also driving mammalian speciation by enabling novel adaptive feeding strategies  Yet little is known of the ecological rules that govern the trillions of microbial symbionts that impact host fitness  We examined the relationship between host factors and gut microbiota characteristics in three lemur species  frugivorous Varecia variegata  generalist Lemur catta  and folivorous Propithecus coquereli  to determine to what extent host lineage  diet  and life stage shape gut community membership  Fecal samples were collected from captive lemur mothers and infants at 6 life stages from birth to weaning  DNA was extracted and a region of bacterial 16S rDNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project  We found that gut colonization proceeds differently in lemur species with differing dietary and ecological profiles  successional trajectories proceed at rates that correspond with infants  rates of development in each species  Radiation within specific bacterial lineages further implies that gut microbial communities have evolved in response to  or in conjunction with  specific lemur feeding strategies  
Patterns of phylogenetic structure in terrestrial and canopy ant communities in Madagascar  The phylogenetic diversity  structure and lineage turnover among communities can provide key insights into the formation of present day geographic distributions by elucidating biotic and abiotic factors of community assembly and species diversification  Madagascar is particularly suited for exploring species diversification patterns and mechanisms  given its role as a mini continent with a contained and relatively well catalogued species pool  We assembled community phylogenies based on genetic data from three nuclear markers for 280 ant species occurring in one dry and one humid forest in Madagascar  and further divided these into canopy  arboreally dwelling  and terrestrial  leaf litter and soil dwelling  communities  We 1  compared both phylogenetic diversity and lineage turnover between these four communities  and  2  determined whether ant communities show a pattern of phylogenetic clustering  higher than random relatedness  or overdispersion  less than random relatedness   Our results show significant differences in phylogenetic structure between the dry and humid  and the arboreal and terrestrial ant communities in each habitat  suggesting that different selection pressures  e g   competition  niche related factors  have acted upon these ant communities  Lineage turnover between dry and humid habitat was moderate compared to a very high species turnover  which may indicate the influence of biogeographic  abiotic  factors in shaping these assemblages  We draw general conclusions from these results in the light of other recent community phylogenetic studies in social insects  Such insights into diversity patterns and community processes  as well as potential drivers of species diversification and endemism of arthropods are of paramount importance to understand the evolution of biodiversity patterns on a global scale  
Ecological divergence across two North American biodiversity hotspots in the Yellow Bellied Kingsnake  Lampropeltis calligaster   Barriers to gene flow have been examined across many taxa and appear to reduce gene flow in populations in predictable ways  Here we use a two part multilocus statistical phylogeographic approach to examine diversity within a North American snake  Lampropeltis calligaster  revealing mode and timing of speciation at two main biodiversity hotspots in Eastern North America  We recovered three well supported species inhabiting distinct ecological niches with divergences dating to the mid  and early Pleistocene with subsequently stable or increasing effective population sizes  further implicating the Pleistocene as an important driver of diversity in North America  These taxa likely diverged ecologically across environments associated with the Mississippi River and at the Florida peninsula  Delimited taxa in allopatry necessarily occupy a subset of the range of the larger species complex  and likely have distinct ecologies with independent trajectories  Ecological niche models suggest that by the end of the century  changes in climate may negatively alter habitat suitability and  barring adaptation  substantially reduce the range for two of the three species   
Nutrition as a constraint on neural evolution  a comparative study across butterflies  The availability of energy and nutrients has been hypothesized to be an important factor in limiting the evolution of large brains  However  organisms readily adapt to low nutrient environments  calling into question whether diet can be a strong evolutionary constraint  Butterflies offer an attractive system to tackle this question because larval nutrition is relatively consistent within species  highly variable across species  and phylogenetic approaches can be used to estimate how long a species has been consuming their current diet  Here we present data from several butterfly families testing how nitrogen and sodium availability shape neural investment  relative eye size  total brain size and the size of neuron dense brain regions   Nitrogen availability appears to be particularly important in the evolution of neural investment  even across species that have been feeding on their current diet for over 50 million years  Sodium availability and the timing of a diet shift are important correlates of neural investment within some lineages  We also use this data set to test for brain life history tradeoffs across species  Overall  these results provide support for the idea that nutrition can constrain the evolution of large  costly brains  
Germline mutation as an outcome of evolved and continually evolving biological processes  In recent years it has become clear that germline mutation is affected by complex biological mechanisms and by DNA sequence and structure  Can this new empirical knowledge tell us something about how evolution works  Indeed  I argue that opening up the black box of the nature of mutation affects fundamental concepts in our understanding of evolution  Specifically  the fact that genetic interactions affect the per locus probability and nature of germline mutation means that information flows from multiple loci into the locus undergoing mutation  This in turn means that  although complex combinations of alleles across loci are not in and of themselves heritable because they are broken down by meiotic recombination  they have heritable effects through the mutations that are derived from them  Finally  it follows that selection acting on complex combinations of alleles across loci  i e   selection acting on individuals as complex wholes  and not simply on single alleles as separate actors  can have heritable effects and drive adaptive evolution  Thus  our new empirical understanding of the nature of mutation offers a way of addressing multiple fundamental open questions in evolutionary biology from a unifying perspective  including how genetic interactions evolve and what the role of sex in evolution is  Namely  sex generates a vast number of different combinations of alleles  selection acts on these combinations  and mutation allows the transmission of information from these combinations to future generations  
Ecological genomics and plasticity of genetic regulation for saltwater tolerance  Evolution of osmoregulatory systems is a key factor in the transition of species between fresh  and saltwater habitats  including species such as anopheline mosquitoes that serve as vectors of disease  Here we use RNA Seq to investigate gene expression differences between an obligate freshwater  Anopheles coluzzii  and euryhaline malaria vector  An  merus   After rearing in freshwater  FW   both young and old larval instars of each species were briefly  6 h  exposed to either saltwater  SW  or FW conditions to test the impact of water salinity on mRNA levels  We aimed to address three questions   1  What is the transcriptomic response of anophelines  represented by An  coluzzii and An  merus  to water salinity   2  How do transcriptomic responses to water salinity differ between species   3  How does the transcriptomic response to water salinity differ with age  particularly for the tolerant species An  merus  Our results are congruent with the ability of gene induction to mediate SW tolerance  with the intolerant An  coluzzii exhibiting little difference in gene expression  An  merus  In the latter   >16  of the 11 025 genes assayed responded to saltwater exposure  with similar levels of up  and down regulation  The impact of age at exposure was less dramatic than species identity  with 567 genes significantly differentially expressed in response to water type between young and old An  merus  Besides effector genes with putative roles in ion transport  e g   Na+ K+ ATPase   we also report differential expression in response to water salinity by genes involved in general stress responses such as heat shock proteins  and potential cross talk between the immune response and osmoregulation  Finally  we take a systems biology approach by investigating gene co expression networks  and present evidence for a potential role of a mosquito specific mitogen activated protein kinase  MAPK  in saltwater adaptation  
 Inferring phylogenetic relationships and understanding venom evolution in cone snails  genus  Conus  using venom duct transcriptomes    Rapid evolution of venom genes is thought to play a crucial role in the diet specialization and diversification of cone snails  genus  Conus   Poorly resolved phylogenetic relationships within Conus and an incomplete understanding of venom gene diversity prevent full examination of the interplay between venom evolution and cone snail diversification  To address these issues  I sequenced the venom duct transcriptomes of 12 species distributed throughout the depth of Conus  identified 500 common cellular genes suitable for phylogenetic reconstruction  and inferred a maximum likelihood phylogeny  Markers identified from transcriptome sequencing provided greater resolution and higher support values at every node compared to markers obtained through traditional Sanger sequencing  In addition  I conducted a preliminary analysis of venom gene evolution across these 12 species  I plan to design a sequence capture array to target the 500 phylogenetic markers and all venom genes across the entire group to understand the impact of venom gene diversification on the evolution of Conus  
Phylogenomics and biogeography of a rapid radiation of crocidurine shrews across the Philippines  The Philippine archipelago is a global biodiversity hotspot and a commonly used island biogeographic model  but the mammalian fauna remains poorly understood  New mammal species are still regularly described  including within the diverse Old World shrew genus Crocidura  >175 species   Previous attempts to resolve the evolutionary relationships among Philippine Crocidura species  10 currently described  have been based on a limited number of loci  yielding poorly supported phylogenetic trees  To resolve these relationships  we sequenced thousands of ultraconserved elements  UCEs  and whole mitochondrial genomes  WMGs  across multiple individuals from nearly all Philippine Crocidura species using a sequence capture approach  We inferred phylogenetic trees for both UCEs and WMGs by applying species tree methodologies and locus concatenation approaches  Our results suggest that the radiation of shrews across the Philippines was rapid  The concatenated gene tree and the species tree feature short internodes  highlighting the importance of using phylogenomic datasets to resolve rapid radiations  
Genome wide association analysis reveals age specific genetic effects on life history traits We used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to identify polymorphisms influencing age specific fecundity and immune response as well as life span   We find that the genetic basis of variation for fecundity and immunity changes dramatically with age   We discuss the implications of this result for life history evolution 
 Neo Y chromosomes in Habronattus jumping spiders  fusions  chiasma localization  and sexual conflict  Araneae Salticidae    Among the 73 species of Habronattus studied  47 have the XXO sex chromosomes in males  the ancestral state for the family   10 have XXY  and 15 have XXXY  The phylogeny indicates that neo Ys  XXY or XXXY  have evolved 8 15 times  a remarkable number for a clade of this size  The fusions producing neo Ys occurred between an X chromosome and an autosome  In contrast  only one autosome autosome fusion is indicated  Chromosome fusions are rarely found in other entelegyne spiders  which MJD White attributed to a constraint caused by their proximal chiasma localization  The origin of the neo Y in Habronattus is correlated with more distal chiasmata  representing the release of MJD White s hypothesized constraint  Although the release of this constraint would have allowed for these fusions to occur  an additional force must be favoring X autosome fusions  Sexual conflict between alleles of the same locus may favor fusions that isolate male favored alleles on the neo Y  This intralocus sexual conflict hypothesis could explain both the many X autosome fusions  and the stunning complexity of male Habronattus courtship displays  
THE GENETICS OF DIVERGENCE AND REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BETWEEN ECOTYPES OF PANICUM HALLII  The process of plant speciation often involves the evolution of divergent ecotypes in response to natural selection imposed by differences in soil water availability between habitats  However  the genetic mechanisms that contribute to divergence and reproductive isolation between such ecotypes are poorly understood  The self fertilizing C4 grass species Panicum hallii includes two major ecotypes  one found most commonly in water limited habitats  var  hallii  and the other  var  filipes  occurring in mesic  wet  habitats  We constructed the first linkage map for P  hallii by genotyping a reduced representation genomic library  We then evaluated the genetic architecture of divergence between these ecotypes through quantitative trait locus  QTL  mapping  Overall  we mapped QTLs for nine morphological traits that are involved in the divergence between the ecotypes  Physiological traits were less divergent  but we still mapped nine QTLs across 14 traits  There were co localizing QTLs for multiple traits  which suggests that pleiotropy may be important for evolution of the ecotypes  We discovered a two locus Dobzhansky Muller incompatibility system that contributes to sterility in hybrids  In addition  we have begun studying the landscape evolutionary genomics of adaptation across a large scale moisture gradient through the whole genome resequencing of P  hallii accessions  Our studies collectively provide new insights into the evolution of divergence and reproductive isolation between ecotypes that have formed in response to selection imposed by variation in soil water availability  
New phylogenetic tools for studying the phenotypic axis of diversification  Over the past three decades or more phylogenies have become central in the study of evolution  In this presentation  I will describe work on some new tools for studying trait evolution using phylogenetic trees  Specifically  I will discuss an approach for identifying the position of one or multiple shifts in the rate of evolution through time  I will propose and illustrate a simple approach that can be used to test the hypothesis that the state of one continuous trait affects the rate of a second  and I will describe a method for reconstructing ancestral states of a discretely valued character trait under the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative genetics  
Toward a mechanistic understanding of trait dependent diversification  The role of niche breadth in the diversification of foregut fermenting mammals  Mammalian herbivores have evolved two suites of digestive physioanatomical adaptations for the microbial fermentation of ingested plants  an enlarged cecum and or colon  i e   hindgut fermentation  or the foregut  i e   foregut fermentation   Foregut fermentation is thought to be the optimal strategy when food is limited and of poor quality  because it extends potential dietary niche breadth by making a larger proportion of vegetation nutritionally accessible to herbivores when food is scarce  We test the hypothesis that the suite of traits producing foregut fermentation promotes species diversification by elevating rates of net diversification through the expansion of dietary niche breadth  Extended niche breadth increases opportunities for allopatric speciation and or divergent selection across species ranges as well as reduces sensitivity to changes that modify the availability of suitable niche  Therefore  foregut lineages are predicted to have higher rates of net diversification and larger niche breadth than hindgut lineages  However  species within any particular lineage are expected to occupy different regions of multidimensional niche space if speciation occurred via divergent selection  This study finds evidence from a maximum likelihood  trait dependent diversification analysis that foregut fermenting herbivorous mammals generally do have higher rates of net diversification than hindgut fermenters  Furthermore  foregut lineages occupy broader niches  quantified with 20 bioclimatic variables and GIS occurrence data  than do hindgut fermenting lineages  However  niche differences between species with the two strategies are not significant in comparisons that explicitly consider phylogeny  Therefore  together our results at the lineage but not species level indicate that enlarged niche breadth is associated with elevated diversification rates in foregut fermenting herbivorous mammals  It is extremely difficult to robustly link pattern and process in macroevolutionary studies of trait based speciation and extinction  but this study offers one approach of testing a factor  i e   niche breadth  that is commonly invoked to explain differences in diversification outcomes among mammals but that is tied to the ecological function of a proposed adaptive trait  
Mitochondrial Nuclear Interactions  Compensatory Evolution or Variable Functional Constraint among Vertebrate Oxidative Phosphorylation Genes   Oxidative phosphorylation  OXPHOS   the major energy producing pathway in aerobic organisms  includes protein subunits encoded by bothmitochondrial  mt  and nuclear  nu  genomes How these independent genomes have coevolved is a long standing question in evolutionary biology  Although mt genes evolve faster than most nu genes  maintenance of OXPHOS structural stability and functional efficiency may involve correlated evolution of mt and nu OXPHOS genes  The nu OXPHOS genes might be predicted to exhibit accelerated evolutionary rates to accommodate the elevated substitution rates of mt OXPHOS subunits with which they interact  Evolutionary rates of nu OXPHOS genes should  therefore  be higher than that of nu genes that are not involved in OXPHOS  nu non OXPHOS  We tested the compensatory evolution hypothesis by comparing the evolutionary rates  synonymous substitution rate dS and nonsynonymous substitution rate dN  among 13 mt OXPHOS genes  60 nu OXPHOS genes  and 77 nu non OXPHOS genes in vertebrates  7 fish and 40 mammal species   The results from a combined analysis of all OXPHOS subunits fit the predictions of the hypothesis  However  results from two OXPHOS complexes did not fit this pattern when analyzed separately  We found that the dN of nu OXPHOS genes for  core  subunits  those involved in the major catalytic activity  was lower than that of  noncore  subunits  whereas therewas no significant difference in dN between genes for nu non OXPHOS and core subunits  This latter finding suggests that compensatory changes play a minor role in the evolution of OXPHOS genes and that the observed accelerated nu substitution rates are due largely to reduced functional constraint on noncore subunits  
The evolution of selfing is accompanied by an increased frequency of effectively neutral and strongly deleterious mutations  The transition from outcrossing to selfing is predicted to reduce the genome wide efficacy of selection because of the lower effective population size  Ne  that accompanies this change in mating system  In contrast  strongly recessive deleterious mutations exposed in more homozygous selfing backgrounds should be under stronger purifying selection  Here  we examine the distribution of fitness effects  DFE  and changes in the magnitude of effective selection coefficients  Nes  acting on mutations during the transition from outcrossing to selfing  Using forward simulations we investigated the ability of the DFE inference approach to detect the joint influence of mating system and the dominance of deleterious mutations on selection efficacy  We then investigated predictions from our simulations in the annual plant  Eichhornia paniculata  in which selfing has evolved on multiple occasions  We used range wide sampling to generate whole transcriptome datasets and identified nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms segregating in outcrossing and selfing populations  Based on both simulation and empirical results  we found that the transition to selfing was accompanied by a change in the DFE  with a larger fraction of sites that were effectively neutral  NesNe in selfers  Moreover  an increased proportion of sites in selfers were under stronger purifying selection  Nes>100   potentially because of the exposure of recessive deleterious mutations  We conclude that the transition to selfing in E  paniculata has been accompanied by the genome wide influences of reduced Ne and stronger purifying selection against deleterious recessive mutations  an example of purging at the molecular level  
Phylogeny and evolution of pharmacophagy in tiger moths  Insecta  Lepidoptera  Erebidae   Tiger moths are comprised of at least 11 000 described species worldwide   They are well known for their bright coloration  mimicry and unique defensive strategies   Moths in this lineage are known to feed on toxic plants as larvae in order to gain chemical protection against vertebrate predators  a k a  pharmacophagy    Some species sequester these toxic plant compounds and use them to defend themselves during the adult stage and also attract and protect their mates  Other tiger moth species engage in sound production to deter predators and signal mates   Despite the important role of tiger moths in chemical ecology and behavioral studies  few molecular investigations of arctiine phylogeny exist   Previous molecular studies support the monophyly of Arctiini  Lithosiini  and Syntomini but do not support the limits of all subtribes within Arctiinae  To test the monophyly of tiger moth subtribes and address the evolution of tiger moth life history traits  a phylogenetic hypothesis of Arctiinae was generated based on DNA sequence data from 9 genes for 95 taxa  a total of 6984 bp was obtained for most species  We examined origins of pyrrolizidine alkaloid  PA  associations and the evolution of PA pharmacophagy in adults   This study also investigated whether specialized proboscis structures are associated with adult pharmacophagy  Our results corroborate earlier studies on the evolution of adult pharmacophagous behaviors  suggesting that this behavior arose multiple times and is concentrated in derived clades within the subfamily   Our results also suggest PA specialization arose early in the phylogeny of the subfamily and that that facultative larval PA acquisition is the derived condition  
Evaluating methods for estimating effective population size in the presence of migration  Effective population size  Ne  is a fundamental and useful metric in population genetics and evolutionary biology   Estimating Ne from genetic data has increased with the rise of affordable genotyping technology  however  the assumptions that multiple genetic methods rely on may be violated in natural situations  resulting in inaccurate estimates  We simulated various demographic histories of populations including ideal  isolated populations and various migration scenarios to assess the ability of different methods to estimate true effective population size  We find variation in the performance of methods across our different scenarios with no single method appearing to function universally  Our results also show that the majority of methods perform poorly at the largest effective population sizes  The linkage disequilibrium method  LDNe  performed well in the majority of scenarios  but is outperformed in scenarios with higher migration rates by a method accounting for migration  MLNe   
High mutation rate and complete linkage can produce episodic nucleotide substitutions in seasonal influenza virus H3N2 without positive selection  Kangchon Kim  and Yuseob Kim    Division of EcoScience and  Department of Life Sciences  Ewha Womans University  Seoul  Korea 120 750 Abstract Nucleotide substitutions in the HA1 domain of seasonal influenza virus H3N2 occur in temporal clusters  which may be attributed to the effect of recurrent selective sweeps underlying antigenic drift  However  classical theory suggests that these episodic substitutions are mainly due to stochastic coalescent processes combined with the unique genetic structure of influenza virus  high cumulative mutation rate over a non recombining viral segment  This explains why  while the effect of selective sweeps between segments is limited due to reassortment  high variance in the number of allelic fixations per year is observed at non antigenic gene segments of H3N2 as well as antigenic  HA and NA  segments  Using simulation  we confirm that in the absence of selection allelic substitutions at non recombining segments with high mutation rate are temporally clustered  the degree of which increases with per segment mutation rate but dramatically decreases if sequences recombine freely  Addition of recurrent selective sweeps or bottlenecks rather leads to reduced clustering in substitutions  We conclude that clustering of fixations in influenza H3N2 segments is a direct result of inherent randomness in genealogical process at linked sites  and that the role of positive selection in the tempo of sequence evolution in rapidly evolving asexual genomes needs to be carefully assessed  
Macroevolutionary consequences of chemical defence in amphibians  Predators have driven the evolution of chemical defences such as poisons in a wide range of species  Although often costly to produce  such defences can relax behavioural constraints imposed by predators and allow prey species to exploit more ecological opportunities  Consequently  we might expect chemical defences to influence macroevolutionary processes such as speciation and extinction via their effects on niche space  Amphibians provide an ideal system in which to test these predictions due to the large number of extant species and variation in the presence or absence of chemical defences  mostly toxins  I therefore used trait dependent diversification models to investigate whether chemical defence explains differences in speciation and extinction rates  as well as rates of gain and loss of chemical defence across the amphibian tree of life  These analyses reveal strong effects of chemical defence on diversification that help us understand the macroevolutionary consequences of antipredator mechanisms  the impact of predation in evolution  and could potentially inform conservation planning via knowledge of differential extinction risks  
Time After Time  Assessing Ecological and Genetic Variation in Daphnia Resting Egg Banks  The use of population genetic and genomic methods in assessing genetic changes in dormant propagule banks is a valuable tool in the study of resurrection ecology   Coupling this approach with comparative  long term studies of populations that have been subjected to differential environmental histories is essential to assess the impact of anthropogenic environmental change   In lakes and ponds  such historic changes can be detected using paleolimnological methods to reconstruct environmental histories from lake sediments that harbor long term records of changes in water chemistry  e g   heavy metals  organo pollutants  nutrients    For our study  we focused on a number of lakes that have served as study sites in a long term monitoring program  Minnesota Sentinel Lakes Program  MN  U S A  that has been assessing the role of phosphorus  P  loading as a key driver of eutrophication  resulting in impacted water quality   In particular  we studied changes in the temporal population genetic structure of the keystone aquatic herbivore  Daphnia pulicaria  using resting eggs extracted from centuries old sediments in two lakes  South Center  Hill    These two lakes showed striking differences in environmental histories prior to and after European settlement  with South Center showing dramatic temporal shifts in genetic structure through time that closely paralleled changes in anthropogenic impacts  i e  human population growth  land use  P loading   while Hill showed no such shifts  paralleling weaker human impacts in its watershed   Using a variety of molecular markers  i e   microsatellites  SNPs  distributed across the entire Daphnia genome  we identify possible relationships between environmental variables and genetic structure in these lake populations  
Ecological constraints on sensory systems  Compound eye size in Daphnia is reduced by resource limitation   Eye size is an indicator of visual capability  and macroevolutionary patterns reveal that taxa inhabiting dim environments have larger eyes than taxa from bright environments  This suggests that the light environment is a key driver of variation in eye size  Yet other factors not directly linked with visual tasks  i e   non sensory factors  may influence eye size  We sought to jointly investigate the roles of sensory  light  and non sensory factors  food  in determining eye size and ask whether non sensory factors could constrain visual capabilities  We tested environmental influences on eye size in four species of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia  crossing bright and dim light levels with high and low resource levels  We measured absolute eye size and eye size relative to body size in early and late adulthood  In general  Daphnia reared on low resources had smaller eyes  both absolutely and relatively  In contrast to the dominant macroevolutionary pattern  phenotypic plasticity in response to light was rarely significant  These patterns of phenotypic plasticity were true for overall diameter of the eye and the width of individual facets  We conclude that non sensory environmental factors can influence sensory systems  and in particular  that resource availability may be an important constraint on visual capability  
Evolutionary genetics of the selfish Segregation Distorter complex  The selfish gene complex Segregation Distorter  SD  on chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best studied meiotic drive systems   Heterozygous SD SD+ males sire almost exclusively SD bearing offspring rather than the expected 1 1 Mendelian ratio   Since the first discovery of SD chromosomes over 50 years ago  the genetics and molecular basis of the system has been intensely studied  however  there are few studies that consider the evolutionary history and dynamics of the SD complex in natural populations   To investigate the age  biogeographic origins  and population genetic history of SD  we studied DNA sequence variation at the major driving locus  Sd RanGAP  from 55 SD chromosomes recovered from European and African populations   The results suggest parallel evolutionary arms races on the two continents that entail the rapid spread of new and different SD chromosome types in geographically separated populations  
Using genome wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate patterns of gene flow and population structure in Crotalus atrox  How the dynamics between gene flow and selection shape the genomic landscape of natural populations is a major question in evolutionary biology  Interpreting how local selection acts upon populations is important for understanding how species adapt to local climate and habitat  and for understanding how speciation occurs  The Western Diamondback Rattlesnake  Crotalus atrox  is a species of North American rattlesnake with an expansive distribution that is subdivided by distinct biogeographic regions  making it a prime system for addressing questions about the influence of local selection on populations in the face of other evolutionary forces  e g   gene flow   A previous study using mitochondrial DNA sequences found evidence for two anciently diverged lineages of C  atrox  which have since integraded  leading to a region of their range that contains populations showing mixed mitochondrial ancestry  Here  we generated a substantially more thorough mitochondrial DNA data set to test previous estimates of gene flow and population genetic structure  We also used restriction site associated DNA  RADseq  libraries to obtain nuclear genome wide estimates of population genetic patterns  Our estimates from both nuclear and mitochondrial data sets were largely congruent  Using these complementary data sets  we estimated historical demography and inferred population structure  and have been able to characterize the population genetic framework of this system  enabling further study of local selection and adaptation   
Baker s General Purpose Genotype  Are highly tolerant weeds also the most fit   As defined by Baker  1965   the  general purpose genotype   GPG  refers to a weed with a wide range of climatic and edaphic tolerances  It has been hypothesized that plasticity in fitness and fitness related traits may underlie the GPG s ability to enter new areas and thus become an invasive  One idea in particular that has been examined is that of  fitness homeostasis   or the ability to maintain fitness across new or damaging environments  Interestingly  the plant defense literature has been discussing  tolerance  in the same vein for many years   Here we ulitize data from a large data set with 12 different weeds and or invasive species planted in a variety of enviroments to investigate tolerance  as defined by the evolutionary ecology literature  both intra specifically and in context of the GPG  Explicitly  we investigate the relationship between fitness and tolerance and tolerance and trait plasticity across many plant species to understand how to best describe the GPG  
The multifaceted role of mating system on genome evolution   Males and females in most vertebrates share nearly identical genomes   This shared genome produces sexually dimorphic phenotypes through sex specific variation in gene expression levels   The genome wide analysis of sex biased genes makes it possible to connect phenotypic sexual dimorphism  the sexually antagonistic selection pressures that shape them  and the regions of the genome that encode them   To assess the link between complex phenotypic sexual dimorphism and global gene expression differences between males and females  we assembled and analysed transcriptomes from six species of birds that range from sexual monomorphism to extreme sexual dimorphism   This gradient of sexual dimorphism within a single clade makes it possible to directly test how sexual selection affects genome evolution and examine how sexually dimorphic phenotypes are encoded  
A native root herbivore drives the evolution of defensive latex metabolites in nature  Roots produce an enormous diversity of secondary compounds with potential activity against below ground herbivores  Yet  evidence that root feeding insects can drive the evolution of defensive metabolites in nature is lacking  We studied the interaction of the common dandelion  Taraxacum sect  Ruderalia  and its native root herbivore  the white grub Melolontha melolontha  by i  measuring the abundance of defensive latex secondary metabolites in dandelion populations under different root herbivore pressure in nature  ii  testing the observed patterns under controlled conditions in the glasshouse and a common garden and iii  using a reverse genetic approach to verify the importance of latex secondary metabolites for root herbivore resistance  We found that taraxinic acid glucoside  TA G   a sesquiterpene lactone glycoside  is highly enriched in the dandelion latex  Natural dandelion populations growing under high M  melolontha density in the field produced more TA G than local and regional controls under low root herbivore pressure  The concentration of TA G among different dandelion genotypes was positively correlated to plant performance upon root herbivory and negatively correlated with larval growth under controlled conditions  Silencing of germacrene A synthase  a key biosynthesis step of sesquiterpene lactones by RNA interference  RNAi  strongly reduced TA G levels in the plant  and we are currently testing whether these lines are less resistant against M  melolontha  Taken together  our results provide first evidence that a native root herbivore may have the potential to drive the evolution of defensive metabolites in nature  
The Diversity and Evolution of the Primate Skin Microbiome  How different are humans from our closest relatives   It is becoming increasingly evident that the skin microbiome plays a key role not only in body odor but also human health and disease   However  little is known about the diversity of microbial inhabitants of the skin  nor of how these assemblages may persevere or turnover throughout evolutionary time  By taking a comparative approach and studying the microbial associates of non human primates  we seek to broaden our understanding of host dependent effects on microbial composition and provide insights into the extent to which the modern condition of our skin microbiome is similar to that of our closest relatives or is uniquely human  whether as a function of our hygiene or other aspects of our biology    To answer these questions  we characterized the microbes living on the skin of humans  chimpanzees  gorillas  rhesus macaques and baboons  We evaluated the bacterial and archaeal residents associated with the axilla of these primate species through high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene  These axillary samples provide a glimpse into the evolution of the primate skin microbiome and are the first study of the skin microbiome of non human primates using non culture dependent methods  In our study  we found that human skin microbial communities were unique relative to other primates  both in terms of which lineages were present and which were absent  In part these differences may reflect the broad story of primate evolution  Alternatively  some of the unique attributes of the human skin microbiome  the absence of lineages present in all other primates  may reflect modern shifts in the skin microbiome as a function of human hygiene   
Transcriptome phylogeny and evolution of host chemical sequestration within the lichen moths  Insecta  Lepidoptera  Erebidae   The lichen moths are a diverse and cosmopolitan tribe  Lepidoptera  Erebidae  Arctiinae  Lithosiini  composed of over 3 000 described species  Their common name arises from the hypothesized larval host  lichens  Lithosiini is the most diverse lineage of lichen feeding Lepidoptera  and the only one known to be able to sequester toxic lichen phenolics  It is hypothesized that the lichen moths use these chemicals to defend the larval  pupal  and adult stages from predators and parasitoids  However  the origin of this defensive strategy within the tribe is unknown  Further study of the evolution of chemical sequestration in this charismatic group has been hindered by the lack of a resolved tribal phylogeny  Studies examining the relationships among the genera of Lithosiini using either morphological or molecular data have been unable to recover the deeper relationships of the tribe  Here we present the first use of next generation sequencing data  transcriptomes  within Lithosiini to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis  This phylogeny is used to assess the evolutionary relationships among the genera and the monophyly of 4 of the 7 subtribes and one generic group  In addition  the metabolic profiles of taxa represented in the phylogeny are surveyed for the presence of lichen phenolics using LC MS  A hypothesis of the evolution of chemical sequestration and lichen feeding in Lithosiini is formed based on these data  
Natural hybridization between lineages that diverged from each other over 50 million years ago  The pace at which populations become reproductively isolated from each other determines how quickly new species can form  Here we show that a fern from the French Pyrenees   Cystocarpium roskamianum  is a recently formed intergeneric hybrid between parental lineages that diverged approximately 60 million years ago  95  highest posterior density  40 2 76 2 million years ago   This is an extraordinarily deep hybridization event roughly akin to an elephant hybridizing with a manatee  or a human with a lemur  This finding  especially in the context of other reported  deep hybrids   suggests that populations of ferns and other plants that reproduce by spores may take longer to achieve complete genetic separation from each other because they lack the premating isolation mechanisms that characterize many other groups  This result implies that major features of Earth s biodiversity such as the relatively small number of species of ferns compared to those of angiosperms may be  in part  an indirect byproduct of this slower  speciation clock   rather than a direct consequence of adaptive innovations by more diverse lineages  
Plasticity of seed dormancy compensates for differences in dispersal timing  Environmental variation can alter the expression of allelic variation  some environmental contexts can magnify the phenotypic differences between allelic variants and others can reduce  or canalize  that variation  Selection among genotypes occurs only under conditions in which phenotypic differences among genotypes are expressed   Environmental conditions can influence germination phenotypes 1  prior to seed dispersal by influencing seed dormancy and 2  post seed dispersal by changing the conditions seeds experience after dispersal  Here we consider how specific environmental factors influence the translation of genetic variation into phenotypic variation  We conducted germination experiments with four genotypes of A  thaliana known to differ in germination phenotypes  We tested how differences in seed maturation temperature and the loss of dormancy with seed aging influence the range of temperatures over which germination can occur  The temperature over which germination occurred differed among genotypes  seed maturation conditions  and after ripening duration  Germination for all genotypes increased with seed maturation environment and seed aging  but genotypes differed in the degree of plasticity to seed maturation environment  We used these results to project germination timing in a seasonal environment and were able formulate predictions about how environmentally induced phenotypic expression may be manifest in an ecologically relevant scenario  We found three genotypes behaved quite similarly despite differences in measured dormancy  but one genotype deviated strongly  Our results also suggested that maternal effects can offset differences in dispersal time in seasonal environments  Consideration of how germination phenology is influenced by both seed maturation temperature and post dispersal conditions will be important for predicting phenology in response to climate change and introduction to novel environments  
Diet affects ejaculate traits in a lizard with condition dependent fertilization success  Sexual selection is predicted to deplete genetic variation in fitness related traits  but condition dependence can maintain phenotypic variation in the face of strong selection  Characteristics of the male ejaculate  such as the quantity or quality of sperm  can be both condition dependent and subject to strong sexual selection  Because sperm production can be energetically costly  males are predicted to respond to limited resources by reducing the quantity or quality of their sperm  We tested the condition dependence of ejaculate traits by experimentally altering body condition through food restriction in the lizard Anolis sagrei  which has condition dependent fertilization success  As predicted  food restriction reduced male body condition and decreased total sperm production relative to males fed ad libitum  Additionally  sperm morphology within individuals was more variable in food restricted males  suggesting that energy limitation detrimentally impacted both the quality and quantity of sperm  Food restriction also increased the size of the sperm midpiece  suggesting a possible tradeoff between sperm quality and quantity under energy limitation  Because these ejaculate traits are potentially related to sperm competitive ability and fertilization success our results suggest that condition dependence may be important for male fitness and the evolution of sperm morphology   
Facultative endohyphal bacterial symbionts alter phenotypes of fungal endophyte hosts  Plant associated fungi provide important ecosystem services as pathogens  mycorrhizae  endophytes  and saprotrophs  Endophytic fungi colonize healthy  living plant tissues in all biomes  often providing protection from pathogens  herbivores  and other environmental stressors  Saprotrophic fungi are the primary decomposers of senescent plant materials  cycling nutrients by breaking down cellulose and lignin  Many fungi play more than one of these roles throughout their life cycles  with functional switches in ecological modes driven in part by interactions with additional microbes  Recently diverse endophytic fungi were found to harbor endohyphal bacteria  EHB   which live within apparently healthy  viable fungal cells  Differences in suites of EHB between closely related fungal endophytes suggest horizontal transfer of these symbionts in nature  This relationship appears facultative for both partners  as bacteria can grow freely under laboratory conditions and we have successfully cured fungi of their EHB  Furthermore  we have developed re association techniques to examine phenotypic changes associated with bacterial symbiosis under laboratory conditions   We found that the presence and identity of EHB significantly influenced the success of plant infection by fungal endophytes  and that these effects display some host specificity  Relative to axenic controls  fungal cultures infected with EHB grew significantly more rapidly on senescent tissue of their native host  and more effectively degraded senescent foliage  In vitro assays revealed that EHB can significantly alter cellulase activity and ligninase production of their fungal hosts  Because EHB can have drastic effects on fungal phenotypes and plant fungal symbioses  and can be horizontally acquired  we suggest that they can influence plant fungal interactions  resultant ecosystem services  and the functional diversification of plant associated fungi  especially with regard to the saprotroph endophyte continuum   
What drives genetic and phenotypic divergence for Iris hexagona  Given that landscapes are heterogeneous in nature  the consequences of these fragmented landscapes include small isolated populations  Within these small populations divergence at both genetic and morphological level can occur  However  genetic and morphological divergence across populations could be the product of limited dispersal  also known as isolation by distance  or adaptation  Within plants  selection on various floral morphologies has been well documented and shown to be influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors  We are examining the relative roles of isolation by distance and isolation by adaptation in promoting morphological divergence within a species  Iris hexagona  a member of the species complex known as the  Louisiana irises   Using a genotyping by sequencing approach  we sampled a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms across I  hexagona genome  We generated a panel of 750 SNPs and used population genetic analyses to test whether patterns of neutral genetic divergence across I  hexagona populations are better explained by isolation by distance or isolation by adaptation  We then compared the amount of divergence among populations at neutral and non neutral SNPs with the magnitude of phenotypic differences in vegetative and floral traits  We show that high levels of genetic differentiation exist for non neutral SNPs compared to neutral SNPs  There is not an overall relationship between pairwise genetic distance  computed for neutral SNPs  and geographic distance  which is consistent with isolation by adaptation  Additionally  we show that non neutral genetic differentiation is correlated with both geographic distance and morphological divergence  which is consistent with isolation by distance  For I  hexgaona  it appears that both isolation by distance and isolation by adaptation are at play in generating divergence  
Scaffolding the origin of multicellular evolvability  A hallmark of major transitions in evolution is the emergence of evolvability in new biological structures  The origin of evolvability presents a conundrum  how can evolvability arise by natural selection  Here we address this problem by demonstrating that even the simplest of multicellular body plans can have an inherent capacity for higher level adaptation  Disrupting the transcription factor ACE2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae prevents cellular separation  generating multicellular  snowflake  yeast  Snowflake yeast clusters exhibit three traits that are criteria for multicellular evolvability  they reproduce via multicellular propagules  they possess heritable variation for traits that affect fitness  and they pass through a unicellular genetic bottleneck during development  limiting within cluster genetic conflict   This work highlights the critical importance of physical scaffolding during major evolutionary transitions  
Evolution of a mating preference for a trait used in intrasexual competition in genetically monogamous populations  The selection pressures by which mating preferences for ornamental traits can evolve in genetically monogamous mating systems remain understudied  Empirical evidence from several taxa supports the prevalence of dual utility traits  defined as traits used both as armaments in intrasexual selection and ornaments in intrasexual selection  Here  we study whether the evolution of mating preferences can occur according to the armament ornament process under strict monogamy  We find that a mating preference for a trait used in intrasexual resource competition can evolve and affect the evolution of the trait  Trait and preference are more likely to persist when the fecundity benefit for mates of successful competitors is large  the viability cost of the trait is low  and the aversion to unornamented potential mates is strong  The preference can facilitate trait fixation even when costly  Our model applies equally to female preferences for male traits and male preferences for female traits  
Evolution of a genetic incompatibility in the genus Xiphophorus  Genetic incompatibilities are commonly observed between hybridizing species  Although the importance of this type of isolating mechanism has received considerable attention  we have few examples describing how genetic incompatibilities evolve  We investigated the evolution of two loci involved in a classic example of a Bateson Dobzhansky Muller  BDM  incompatibility in Xiphophorus  a genus of freshwater fishes from northern Central America  Hybrids develop a lethal melanoma due to the interaction of two loci  an oncogene and its repressor  We cloned and sequenced the putative repressor locus in 25 Xiphophorus species and an outgroup species  and determined the status of the oncogene in those species from the literature  Using phylogenetic analyses  we find that the promoter region of the repressor is coevolving with the oncogene  The results suggest a variation on the BDM hypothesis for the evolution of incompatibilities where incompatible genotypes have been produced at several times during the evolutionary history of the genus Xiphophorus  and have further implications for sexually antagonistic selection and the evolution of cancer  
The environmental determinants of natural selection  Although >6000 estimates of phenotypic selection have been published  the environmental factors that cause this selection have rarely been identified  making it difficult to predict how populations will respond to environmental change   One approach to identifying the causes of selection is to experimentally manipulate an environmental factor and compare estimates of selection between treatments   If the strength or direction of selection on a trait differs between treatments  then we can infer that the manipulated environmental factor is a cause of selection on that trait   But estimates of phenotypic selection from experimental studies  unlike estimates of selection from natural populations  have yet to be compiled and synthesized     We compiled a database of estimates of selection from >140 experimental studies published between 1991 and 2013   We used this database to test two hypotheses as to why different environmental factors will be more or less likely to alter the strength of selection  as well as whether the strength of selection measured in experimental studies is comparable to selection in natural populations   We found that the strength of directional selection did not vary among environmental factors  which is not consistent with the hypothesis that the biotic environment exerts stronger selection than the abiotic environment   We also found that there was no relationship between the magnitude of change in mean fitness between treatments and the magnitude of change in directional selection between these treatments  which does not support the hypothesis that environmental factors that have a large effect on mean fitness will exert stronger selection than factors that have a small effect on mean fitness   However  estimates of directional selection from experimental studies were comparable to estimates of selection in the wild  supporting the use of experiments to identify the causes of natural selection     
The vanishing refuge revisited  Tropical areas are extremely biodiverse both because of high species and functional phenotypic diversity  A plethora of evolutionary processes have interacted with environmental change over space and time to shape this extraordinary diversity  Recent emphasis on ecological aspects of speciation draws attention to how selection can drive divergence and speciation  In this context  we are motivated to revisit one model of speciation  the vanishing refuge model  VRM  that encapsulates all these aspects  The VRM reconciles ecogeographic speciation with a modification of the forest refuge model in an attempt to explain patterns of distribution where sister or closely related species inhabit contrasting habitat types  The model evokes vicariance and divergent selection  leading to genetic divergence and phenotypic disparity among populations  eventually leading to speciation caused by climate driven fragmentation of forested areas that vanish and give place to drier and more open habitats  Thirty years after its publication  this model remains relevant for integrating both geographic and ecological mechanisms of divergence and speciation  and it can be straightforwardly transferred to species in other vanishing biomes  We take advantage of the accumulating evidence on ecogeographic variation in the mega diverse central corridor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and adjacent dry biome  one of the original motivating systems  spanning across a range of phylogenetic depths  to  1  make clear predictions on patterns of genetic structure  phylogenetic relationships  habitat and climate histories  and phenotypic disparity resulting from this model  and  2  consider alternative hypotheses on drivers of divergence and speciation that result in diversity patterns similar to those expected under the VRM  We identify several candidate systems and we test the predictions of VRM with one case  with data on habitat shifts  phylogeography and ecologically relevant phenotypes  We also explore how some taxa will be more likely than others to diversify in response to the shrinking and vanishing refugia  In this context  we predict that additionally to the presence of pre adaptations to distinct environmental conditions  divergent selection is aided by high lability in tolerance traits  in such taxa  Our findings support the view that divergent selection acting in populations from geographic isolates in climatically dynamic areas can be a powerful force driving population divergence and  potentially  speciation and also highlight how populations in peripheral isolates show potential to adapt locally  We conclude by suggesting that studies on population divergence and speciation will benefit from more integrated analyses of molecular and phenotypic divergence  
Sympatric species of stickleback differ in cognition and brain structure in ways consistent with adaptation to divergent environments  Fundamental questions remain about how the brain generates behavior and how brain structure and cognition evolve in response to selection  An ideal system to study cognitive evolution is one with recent and strong divergent selection  providing clear predictions about the differences in cognitive abilities or brain structures between the recently diverged groups  Marine threespine sticklebacks  Gasteroseus aculeatus  colonized multiple lakes in British Columbia  and subsequently adapted to two distinct ecological niches  the  limnetic  and  benthic   over the course of  12K years  in the process becoming reproductively isolated  We use two different  but complementary approaches to study cognitive evolution in this system  First  we conduct behavioral experiments to assess specific cognitive abilities in each species  Second  we collect neuroanatomical data on specific brain structures  for example  by using magnetic resonance imaging  MRI   As an example of the first approach  we tested individuals on social information use  specifically the ability to use the feeding behavior of others to locate a food patch  In two lakes we found evidence for parallel evolution of species differences in social information use  benthic fish use social information to locate a food patch whereas limnetic fish do not  These differences are reversed in Enos lake  where the two former species have been hybridizing after human disturbance  Given a previous finding of parallel evolution of faster spatial learning in benthic fish compared to limnetic fish  it is possible that benthic fish are better at learning in general  Neuroanatomical evidence for this would be larger telencephalons  forebrains  in benthic fish than limnetic fish  We found that telencephalon size is indeed larger in benthic fish  even after controlling for body size  Other brain regions  for example  olfactory bulbs  also differ in size in the direction predicted by behavioral and ecological differences between the species  Sticklebacks are a model system for evolutionary biology  and further study of their cognition will provide an opportunity to address long standing questions regarding the evolution of cognition and the brain  
Spatial variation of microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract of natural populations of house mice  Host associated microbial communities  microbiota  play an important role in evolution  Characterizing the microbiota along different portions of the gastrointestinal  GI  tract may help us understand the mechanisms shaping the composition of microbial communities  Here we describe the microbiota across the GI tract in natural populations of house mice  Mus musculus  and discuss factors that might be structuring these microbial communities  We collected GI samples from six individuals from Tucson  Arizona  Microbes were characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing  DNA was extracted from 10 locations along the GI tract from each individual including mouth  esophagus  stomach  duodenum  ileum  proximal cecum  distal cecum  colon  rectum  and feces  We found major shifts in diversity and relative abundance of microbial taxa between the upper and lower GI tract  The lower GI tract  cecum to feces  showed greater microbial diversity and greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa compared to the upper GI tract  mouth to ileum   Microbial communities are clustered by host genotype only in the lower GI tract but not in upper GI tract  Fecal samples were similar to the microbiota of the lower GI tract where the majority of digestion takes place in hindgut fermenters   
The eunuch phenomenon  adaptive evolution of genital emasculation in sexually dimorphic spiders  Under natural and sexual selection traits often evolve that secure paternity or maternity through self sacrifice to predators  rivals  offspring  or partners  Emasculation males removing their genitals is an unusual example of such behaviours  Known only in insects and spiders  the phenomenon s adaptiveness is difficult to explain  yet its repeated origins and association with sexual size dimorphism  SSD  and sexual cannibalism suggest an adaptive significance  In spiders  emasculation of paired male sperm transferring organs  palps   results in  eunuchs   This behaviour has been hypothesized to be adaptive because  i  males plug female genitals with their severed palps  plugging hypothesis    ii  males remove their palps to become better fighters in male male contests  better fighter hypothesis   perhaps reaching higher agility due to reduced total body mass  gloves off hypothesis   and  iii  males achieve prolonged sperm transfer through severed genitals  remote copulation hypothesis   Prior research has provided evidence in support of these hypotheses in some orb weaving spiders but these explanations are far from general  Seeking broad macroevolutionary patterns of spider emasculation  we review the known occurrences  weigh the evidence in support of the hypotheses in each known case  and redefine more precisely the particular cases of emasculation depending on its timing in relation to maturation and mating   pre maturation    mating   and  post mating   We use a genus level spider phylogeny to explore emasculation evolution and to investigate potential evolutionary linkage between emasculation  SSD  lesser genital damage  and sexual cannibalism  We find a complex pattern of spider emasculation evolution  all cases confined to Araneoidea  emasculation evolved at least five and up to eleven times  was lost at least four times  and became further modified at least once  We also find emasculation  as well as lesser genital damage and sexual cannibalism  to be significantly associated with SSD  These behavioural and morphological traits thus likely co evolve in spiders  Emasculation can be seen as an extreme form of genital mutilation  or even a terminal investment strategy linked to the evolution of monogyny  However  as different emasculation cases in araneoid spiders are neither homologous nor biologically identical  and may or may not serve as paternity protection  the direct link to monogyny is not clear cut  
A genome wide exploration of the pleiotropic theory of senescence  Are human disease and senescence the result of natural selection   Changing demographic patterns and the ageing of the World s population  have spurred the interest on the causes and mechanisms of senescence  Senescence has long been a mystery  with no single universally accepted theory accounting for its ultimate evolutionary causes  if indeed these causes exist   Perhaps the most popular of the evolutionary explanations proposed so far is the pleiotropic theory of senescence  suggested by G  Williams in 1957   This theory states that mutations conferring risk for traits that are damaging for the organism late in life  e g  after the fertile stage  might be maintained in a population if they are advantageous early in life  when they can result in an increased reproductive success   In humans  this theory is consistent with evidence coming from certain genes  from specific conditions or from the life long reproductive patterns of a few animal models  However  an exhaustive assessment of the impact of all these pleiotropic effects in the senescence of our species has not yet been carried out   Using public metadata from Genome Wide Association Studies  GWAS 2 we quantified the global extent and evolutionary implications for our species of the kind of early late age antagonistic pleiotropy predicted by the theory  Diseases were split in early or late onset conditions and pleiotropies were computed among the SNPs reported to be associated with the diseases   Our preliminary results are two fold  First  they reveal some non trivial antagonistic pleiotropies  that may be relevant to diagnosis and treatment of age related pathologies  Second  and more interestingly in evolutionary terms  we observe a significant excess of early late antagonistic pleiotropy in our genomes  some of which present the signature of natural selection   At the time of submission  we are examining the consistency of the signatures of natural selection around pleiotropies with their putative role in the evolution of senescence   References  1  Williams  G   1957   Pleiotropy  natural selection  and the evolution of senescence  2  Hindorff  LA et al    2009    NHGRI GWAS Catalog  https   www genome gov 26525384 
Analysis of six gene sets in the chimpanzee lineage illustrates the differential action of natural selection upon coding and non coding sequences  We investigate the selective forces acting in the coding and non coding regions of six different functional and evolutionary gene sets  i  two reference sets presenting accelerated and slow rates of protein evolution  Complement and Actin pathways   ii  a set of genes with evidence of accelerated evolution in at least one of their introns  and iii  three gene sets related to neurological function  Parkinson  Amyloid and Presinilin   To that effect  we combine human chimpanzee divergence patterns with polymorphism data obtained from target resequencing 20 central chimpanzees  By using the DFE alpha extension of the McDonald Kreitman test  we reproduce inferences of rates of evolution previously based solely on divergence data on both coding and intronic sequences and also obtain inferences for other classes of genomics elements  UTRs  promoters and trailers   We confirm that the accelerated rates of divergence previously inferred in coding and non coding elements can be attributed to positive selection and not to relaxation of purifying selection and find consistent trends of recent evolutionary constraint in the coding sequences from all three neurological pathways  Interestingly  particular genes and introns that in our reference sets i  and ii  did not present accelerated rates of divergence do show high rates of adaptive substitution when combining polymorphism and divergence data  Such a pattern suggests that each class of genomic element tends to evolve under particular adaptive forces within the same pathway or evolutionary gene set  On the contrary  the adaptive history of coding and non coding sequences within each dataset analyzed seems to be decoupled  
Genome wide analysis of wild type Epstein Barr virus genomes derived from healthy individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project  Most people in the world   90   are infected by the Epstein Barr virus  EBV   which establishes itself permanently in B cells  Infection by EBV is related to a number of diseases including infectious mononucleosis  multiple sclerosis and different types of cancer  So far  only seven complete EBV strains have been described  all of them coming from donors presenting EBV related diseases  To perform a detailed comparative genomics analysis of EBV including  for the first time  EBV strains derived from healthy individuals we reconstructed EBV sequences infecting lymphoblastoid cell lines  LCLs  from the 1000 Genomes Project  Since strain B95 8 was used to transform B cells to obtain LCLs  it is always present  but a specific deletion in its genome sets it apart from natural EBV strains  After studying hundreds of individuals  we determined the presence of natural EBV in at least 10 of them and obtained a set of variants specific to wild type EBV  By mapping the natural EBV reads into the EBV reference genome  NC007605  we constructed wild type viral genomes from three individuals  Analysis of all the available sequences reveals a complex history of recombination among EBV strains and that latency genes harbor more nucleotide diversity than lytic genes  Six out of nine latency related genes present the molecular signature of positive selection  suggesting rapid host parasite co evolution  
 Bioenergetics of transcription factor evolution  pleiotropic constraint  compensation and a sweet spot for hybrid incompatibility   Hybrid incompatibility can result from gene misregulation when interacting pairs of transcription factors and their cis regulatory targets differentially coevolve in separate populations   Pleiotropy ought to constrain the evolution of incompatibility because transcription factors  TFs  that serve multiple functions should be less likely to diverge   How profound is this constraint  We applied a bioenergetic model of molecular interaction wherein gene expression is determined by fractional occupancy of a TF bound to its cis regulatory target   Occupancy is in turn determined by bioenergetic parameters  free energy of binding between interacting allelic variants  the number of TF molecules available  and competition for the TF from sequence similar sites in the genomic background   We represented alleles by bit strings  and binding energy depended on their match   Combinations of parameter values determined the genotype phenotype  G P  map   a sigmoidal relationship between allelic mismatches and phenotypic expression  Misregulation occurs when a phenotype differs from its optimal value   We simulated a pleiotropic regulatory pathway involving a conserved and a directionally selected trait  regulated by a shared TF  with two populations evolving in parallel  Pleiotropy indeed slowed the evolution of the TF  shifting more of the response to the cis regulatory locus of the directionally selected trait  but compensatory evolution still occurred at the cis regulatory locus of the conserved trait   Both traits contributed to hybrid misregulation  The shape of the G P map  and therefore its underlying bioenergetic parameters  determined much of the evolutionary dynamics of hybrid misregulation   Pleiotropic constraints on hybrid misregulation became prohibitive when the G P map became too steep   Likewise  phenotypic change was insensitive to mismatches when the G P map became too plateaued  with hybrids showing little misregulation despite the lack of constraint   Between these extremes  a broad sweet spot existed  permitting the evolution of substantial hybrid incompatibility in both traits in the presence of pleiotropy    
The role of deleterious mutations in influenza s antigenic evolution  The evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses  as all organisms  depend on the occurrence of beneficial  deleterious  and neutral mutations  Yet  despite evidence for strong genetic linkage  the majority of studies on viral adaptive evolution focus exclusively on the role that beneficial mutations play in this process  This is particularly the case in modeling studies examining patterns of antigenic evolution in acute  semi immunizing viral pathogens such as influenza  Here  we develop a model to address the dynamic interplay between beneficial mutations that enable immune escape and deleterious mutations that reduce between host viral transmission  In an application of this model to influenza viruses in humans  we show that deleterious mutations are expected to make antigenic evolution occur in a punctuated manner  a pattern that has been empirically observed in these viruses  We further show that deleterious mutations are expected to substantially limit influenza s genetic and antigenic diversity in the long run  Finally  we show that the dynamical effect of deleterious mutations provides a parsimonious explanation for two empirical observations in influenza  the occasional occurrence of within subtype reassortment preceding an antigenic cluster transition and the tendency of antigenic clusters to arise from Asian  or more generally  tropical regions  This work highlights the critical importance of deleterious mutations in shaping patterns of viral adaptive evolution  even if they are not themselves the source of adaptation  
Bayesian estimation of phylogenetic information content and its implications for site stripping  We present Bayesian statistical methodology for estimating phylogenetic information content  and for identifying conflicting signal when present  The Kullback Leibler  KL  divergence between prior and posterior  also known as the relative entropy of the posterior with respect to the prior  measures the amount of information about the model parameters contained in the data  Bounds for the minimum and maximum information content may be constructed using conditional clade estimates of tree topology posterior probabilities introduced recently by Larget  Conflicting phylogenetic information between data subsets is manifested as a decrease in information in combined compared to separate data sets  The ability to accurately measure information content has many applications in phylogenetics  providing  for example  a meaningful measure of saturation and an objective way to sort subsets of a partitioned data set  genes in a genomic alignment  morphology vs  molecules  codon positions  etc   from most to least informative  As an example application  we compare two methods  Conditional Predictive Ordinates  CPO  and Observed Variability  OV  for identifying the noisiest sites in an alignment  and discuss the implications of using either OV or CPO for site stripping  
 The impact of inbreeding depression on the evolution of herbicide resistance in the agricultural crop weed  Ipomoea purpurea   How changes in mating system influence the evolution of herbicide resistance has yet to be considered in any weed species  It is unknown if  during the process of resistance evolution  a population may become more inbred and suffer fitness consequences due to inbreeding depression  A large scale field experiment was conducted using selectively bred glyphosate resistant and susceptible Ipomoea purpurea lines to address this question  Maternal lines from resistant and susceptible families were self pollinated to produce inbred progeny  and outcrossed to three paternal lines within their resistance class to produce outcrossed half sibs for comparison  We also performed this same crossing scheme using a second generation of artificially selected resistant susceptible lines  We observed inbreeding depression in all size and fitness characters  We further found that this inbreeding depression was present only in the resistant lines and was detected in both generations of artificial selection  We hypothesize that  in inbred resistant individuals  a pleiotropic interaction between the resistance locus and deleterious recessives leads to lower fitness of inbred  resistant plants compared to outcrossed  resistant plants  
Using linked microsatellites to infer basic population decline parameters  a case study on a Mexican relict spruce  Estimating demographic parameters is fundamental for conservation programs  Such estimates are generally inferred from the variation of unlinked genomic regions  which are often unavailable for non model threatened species  These limitations can be circumvented by using universal and highly polymorphic markers that can be transferred across taxa  such as cytoplasmic SSRs  These markers have been shown to be sensitive to population expansions  but no formal test has been conducted to explore if they can be used to infer and distinguish between competing bottleneck scenarios  Herein  we simulated the evolution of ten linked SSRs in populations submitted to different bottleneck regimes   1   0   0 01  0 1  0 5 and 0 90  at different times       0 5  1 and 10   The variation of these markers  as compiled with five summary statistics  allowed detecting severe population collapses independently of    and as long as stands kept roughly constant effective sizes after the size reduction  Mild declines became difficult to infer as   increased  and small bottlenecks were virtually undetectable with these markers  More complex frameworks  such as bottlenecks followed by sudden expansions  were also difficult to infer  Comparisons with the chloroplast SSR variation of the relict Mexican spruce  Picea mexicana  suggested that this species went through a severe bottleneck that could be dated back to the last interglaciation  LIG   130 000 to 116 000 years ago   These results indicate that linked SSRs can be used as proxies to infer basic parameters of population decline in species that lack adequate genomic tools  particularly in emerging countries   
More than one way to evolve a weed   Southeast Asian weedy rice population genetics and US weedy rice QTL mapping studies based on Genotyping by Seque  population genetic study focusing on the comparative weedy rice origins between the US  South Korea and Southeast Asia  STRUCTURE and PCoA analyses suggest that weedy rice populations  in Cambodia  Thailand  Vietnam and Indonesia has a genetic admixture of crop and wild rice  which is different from the US  South Korea and Malaysian weedy rice  Our studies demonstrate multiple  parallel origins of weedy rice  This knowledge of weed origins is essential for future weedy rice control strategies  
Fusarium graminearum species complex from highland areas in Malaysia  Fusarium graminearum species complex was recovered during a survey on biodiversity of Fusarium species conducted in three highland areas in Malaysia  namely Cameron Highlands  Fraser s Hill and Kinabalu Park   Based on morphological characteristics  among the isolates of Fusarium isolated were 77 isolates of F  graminearum species complex which was mostly isolated from mountain barley  Elyhordeum montanense  plant parts   Species identity of the morphologically identified species was analyzed using translation elongation factor 1  gene  TEF 1   sequences  Based on BLAST search of Fusarium ID database  isolates of F  graminearum species complex showed sequence similarity with several lineages of the species complex  namely F  austroamericanum  lineage 1   F  meridionale  lineage 2   F  boothii  lineage 3   F  mesoamericanum  lineage 4   F  acaciae mearnsii  lineage 5   F  asiaticum  lineage 6  and F  cortaderiae  lineage 8   The most common lineage was F  asiaticum comprising 16 isolates  Mycotoxin analysis showed that 33 isolates as representative of the F  graminearum species complex produced zearalenone ranging from 0 002   0 437µg kg  and the isolates did not produce fumonisin B1  beauvericin  and moniliformin  To our knowledge  the present study is the first recorded Fusarium graminearum species complex with different lineages  in tropical highland areas in Malaysia  
First passage time to allopatric speciation and species creation rate  Allopatric speciation is a mechanism to evolve reproductive isolation  it is caused by the accumulation of genetic differences between populations while they are geographically isolated  We study the rate of allopatric speciation for a species in multiple islands between which migration occurs only infrequently  We assumed that mating incompatibility is controlled by a number of loci that behave as neutral characters in the accumulation of novel mutations within each population  Genetic distance between populations was defined as the number of incompatibility controlling loci that differ between them  Genetic distance increases through the separate accumulation of mutations in different populations  but drops after a successful migration event followed by genetic mixing between migrants and residents  We calculated the time to allopatric speciation  which occurs when the genetic distance exceeds a specified threshold  The diffusion approximation  stochastic differential equation  and the direct computer simulation of individual based model are all similar  There is an intermediate optimal rate of migration that maximises the rate of species creation by recurrent invasion and diversification  We also discuss waiting time to allopatric speciation and its geographic patterns of a species forming metapopulation  
The predictors of avian song evolution  sexual selection and the trade off between acoustic and visual signals  Bird song  like many acoustic signals produced by species across the animal kingdom  plays a key role mediating  mate choice  resource defence  and species recognition trait  Identifying the factors that influence song divergence can therefore reveal the processes underlying the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations  and ultimately speciation  Yet  despite having clear implications for our understanding of species diversification  the mechanisms driving rates of song evolution and their relative importance remain poorly understood  Here  we analyse evolutionary rates of song divergence  using newly developed phylogenetic methods applied to a dataset of over 2500 songs from 235 pairs of closely related passerine bird species  Our results reveal that independent components of song structure  e g  song frequency or duration  are influenced by unique combinations of physiological  ecological  and biogeographical factors  However  we find that overall levels of song divergence are most strongly predicted by the interaction between latitude and sexual dichromatism  rate of song divergence increases away from the tropics  but only amongst pairs that lack sex differences in plumage coloration  supporting the existence of a trade off between visual and acoustic signalling modalities  If the intensity of sexual selection increases with latitude  our results suggest that song divergence is most rapid when the focus of intense sexual selection targets acoustic  rather than visual  signals  
Information flow through dominance network in social insect colonies  Flow of information is important for the proper functioning of diverse biological  social and engineered systems  Social insects are known for their fascinatingly successful social systems  which could be achieved by an effective flow of information through the complex connectivity patterns among the colony members  Network representation of such behavioral interactions offers a powerful way for the structural as well as dynamical analysis of the underlying regulatory systems  We focus on dominance interaction networks in the tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata   a species where behavioural observations indicate that such interactions are principally responsible for transfer of information between individuals about their colony needs  resulting in regulation of their own activities   Our analysis of the dominance networks of R  marginata reveals its structural similarity with a class of naturally evolved information processing networks  In particular  the colonies exhibit the predominance of a specific substructure  the feed forward loop  which is the key functional component in many information transfer networks  The dynamical analysis through Boolean modeling confirms that the network is sufficiently stable under small fluctuations and yet capable of more efficient information transfer compared to their randomized counterparts  Our findings suggest the involvement of a common structural design principle in the biological regulatory systems and a possible similarity in the effect of selection on the organization levels of such systems  They are also consistent with the hypothesis that dominance behaviour has been shaped by natural selection to co opt the information transfer process in the primitively eusocial species  in addition to its primal function of mediation of reproductive competition in the colony  
 LARGE SCALE ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE IN BOECHERA FECUNDA  AN ENDANGERED WILD RELATIVE OF ARABIDOPSIS   Many biological species are threatened with extinction because of a number of factors such as habitat loss  and their preservation depends on an accurate understanding of the extent of their genetic variability within and among populations   In this study we assessed the quantitative genetic divergence in 10 populations of an endangered cruciferous species  Boechera fecunda  restricted to two geographical regions  WEST and EAST  in western Montana   Heritabilities estimated from nested ANOVAs were generally high for leaf and rosette traits  but quite low and non significant for water use efficiency  WUE   Genetic coefficients of variation were high for all traits  indicating ample existing genetic variability   Measures of quantitative genetic differentiation  QST  were calculated for each trait from each pair of populations   For four traits  these values were significantly higher for populations between regions compared to those within regions  even after adjustment for neutral genetic variation   supporting that natural selection has acted to produce regional divergence in this species   Our analysis also revealed that the B  fecunda populations are locally adapted to specific environmental conditions in the EAST and WEST regions  especially measures of precipitation   Conservation efforts for B  fecunda therefore should be directed to the preservation of populations in each of these two regions without attempting transplantation between regions  
Fitness functions and distributions  the shape of things to come  Fishers Fundamental Theorem predicts fitness change from the additive genetic variance for fitness   We explore the characteristics of the distribution of additive genetic fitness effects under the standard Gaussian fitness function on a normally distributed trait  and extend this to fitness functions induced simultaneously by more than one fitness component  such as survival and fecundity  
Evolutionary trends in consolidated human biological pathways  Comparing biological pathways is an important tool for studies of evolution  To this end  we defined SuperPaths  clusters of human biological pathways that are similar in gene content  thus reducing the redundancy found in diverse pathway databases  We clustered human biological pathways from 12 sources into a collection of 1043 SuperPaths each containing 1 66 pathways and 1 1973 genes  For evolutionary analyses  we assigned an evolutionary age for every SuperPath  This was done by identifying for each constituent gene for the earliest appearance across 12 time points that include all domains of life  Bacteria  Archaea  Eukarya  Unikonta  Opisthokonta  Metazoa  Bilateria  Vertebrata  Amniota  Mammalia  Euarchontoglires  and Primates  This was based on orthology relations from GeneCards  www genecards org    For every SuperPath we constructed an evolutionary vector  conveying the number of genes originating at different time points  For 52  of the SuperPaths we were able to define an evolutionary age as that at which >50  of the contained genes originated   The most highly populated SuperPaths origins were Bacteria  16    Eukarya  63   and Metazoa  14    It is noteworthy that >50  of the SuperPath show distinct origins  stemming from the observation that a majority of their genes originate in a narrow evolutionary window  suggesting that the rise of biological pathways is highly synchronized  Utilizing top level KEGG ontology terms for genes we assigned a functional category to each SuperPath  based on the most prevalent term among its contained genes  Interestingly  metabolic pathways are significantly enriched in bacterial origin  while signal transduction pathways are enriched in Eukaryotic and Metazoan origin  Utilizing an algorithm for assessing a SuperPath s RNAseq based expression pattern across 16 tissues  we show that SuperPaths differentially expressed in liver are significantly correlated with enrichment in Bacterial origin  while those differentially expressed in testes have Archeal enrichment   
The coupling of niche divergence and lineage diversification at different spatial scales  The concept of the niche has played a fundamental role in our understanding of the origins of biological diversity  Specifically  the hypothesis that niche divergence drives speciation  such as in adaptive radiation  In this context  it is important to recognize that niche divergence may occur at both small and large spatial scales  At either spatial scale  ecological and evolutionary theories predict a positive relationship between the rate of niche evolution and the rate of lineage diversification  This predication has seldom be tested  At small spatial scales  species may diverge in morphological traits tied to resource partitioning within communities  which facilitates diversification by reducing competition and propelling incipient species into novel adaptive zones or environments  At large spatial scales  lineages may diverge in macro habitat preferences or climatic tolerances thereby promoting local adaptation  In both scenarios  if gene flow is reduced sufficiently  speciation may occur  Because morphological divergence is often tied to niche divergence at large spatial scales  via the colonization of novel environments  we further predict a positive relationship between rates of niche evolution at small and large spatial scales  We tested these predictions using the morphologically and environmentally diverse South American bird family Furnariidae  one of the most species rich bird families in the world  We quantified the niche for all species at both large and small spatial scales with morphological measurements and climatic niche data  respectively  We divided a time calibrated phylogeny of the family into independent clades  for which we estimated rates of morphological and climatic niche evolution and the rate of lineage diversification  Using phylogenetic regression  we found that both rates of climatic niche evolution and rates morphological evolution predicted rates of lineage diversification yet this relationship was stronger for the climatic niche  We also found a positive relationship between rates of morphological and climatic niche evolution  These results suggest that morphological evolution relevant to resource partitioning at small spatial scales can be coupled with climatic niche evolution promoting geographic isolation and population differentiation at large spatial scales  Rapid evolution in both niche axes  in turn  promotes rapid lineage diversification  This demonstrates that a holistic examination of niche evolution can connect disparate ecological and evolutionary processes to help understand the drivers of lineage diversification  
Symbiotic partnership in brood protection  use of mycelial cover in a fungus farming ant  Ants of the tribe Attini have closely coevolved with their fungal symbiont for over 50 million years   The fungus serves not only as food  but as a protective nursery where brood are stored and covered with a thin layer of fungal mycelia  hypothesized to protect against microbial attack   Differences between mycelial cover on different brood types  eggs  larvae  and pupae  have been observed in colonies excavated from the field  and different agricultural groups display contrasting patterns   Older brood are more heavily covered in the most basal and derived attine groups  while brood of transitional taxa show the opposite pattern   However  these patterns are unaddressed in the literature  and it is unknown whether they reflect preferential treatment of certain brood types by workers  or environmental conditions such as predation   To test worker deposition of fungal mycelia  colonies of a phylogenetically  transitional  attine ant  Trachymyrmex cornetzi  were excavated in the field and brought into the lab   T  cornetzi has been used previously to study traits that diverge along phylogenetic lines  and here represents the unusual pattern of greater coverage on younger brood   Samples were created where a handful of workers were given one larva  one pupa  and a small amount of their fungus garden to reconstruct    Pupae had less cover than larvae both before and after a three day trial  matching the pattern previously observed in the field   However  rate of deposition was not significantly different   This may suggest that deposition rates are highest in very young larvae  and decline as brood age towards the pupal stage   Our results suggest that field data showing contradictory patterns in mycelial cover across taxonomic groups accurately reflect strong differences in brood care practices across the phylogeny   If mycelial cover serves as a method of disease control  as hypothesized  this pattern is counterintuitive  sympatric species might be expected to have similar patterns of brood protection  and differ only by degree   Thus  the opposing practices of different taxonomic groups that our data indicates demands further investigation  
Diversity Patterns of Cretaceous Mammals  Implications from a Geometric Morphometric Analysis of Molar Shape  The end Cretaceous extinction of non avian dinosaurs opened ecological niche space that was subsequently exploited by Cenozoic mammals  However  some evidence suggests mammals had begun to diversify prior to the Cretaceous Paleogene  K Pg  boundary  66 million years ago   Diversification of mammals into new ecological niches would have led to a greater variety of diets  and  consequently  an increase in morphological disparity of molars  To assess the possibility that mammals had begun to diversify prior to the K Pg boundary  I examined morphological disparity patterns of Cretaceous therians  the mammal group that gave rise to diverse placentals and marsupials  Two dimensional landmark data from occlusal surfaces of individual molars belonging to 60 crown therian and stem boreosphenidan genera were studied using geometric morphometric techniques  including a Procrustes analysis and principal components analysis  Therian genera were assigned to Cretaceous time bins based on the temporal range of their fossil occurrences  and morphological disparity of molar shape was calculated for each time bin  To explore evolutionary trends on a regional scale  taxa from North America and Asia were separated and results were considered independently for the two continents  An additional measure of therian disparity was obtained from body mass estimates  which were calculated using the dimensions of the first lower molar  Results indicate that morphological disparity was low for both North American and Asian taxa during much of the Cretaceous and then experienced a rapid increase during the Campanian  84 72 million years ago   Disparity results based on the global data set show a decrease in disparity during the Maastrichtian  72 66 million years ago   but results based solely on North American taxa suggest that disparity continued to increase during the Maastrichtian  This difference may be due in part to the Maastrichtian fossil record being dominated by North American fossils  resulting in Maastrichtian disparity values that are less reflective of a global trend  Based on the current fossil record  it is concluded that therian mammals experienced a morphological diversification during the Late Cretaceous  although it remains uncertain as to whether this diversification trend was maintained until the K Pg boundary  
The evolutionary importance of male and mutual mate choice  Male mate choice is increasingly recognized as important  I will look at the role of male mate choice in an extreme system  where male choice has a very important role  I will place this example in a broad context and suggest approaches and methods to advance the field  
Empirical evidence for a continuum between semelparity and iteroparity  Semelparity and iteroparity are considered to be distinct life history strategies  but life history theorists  e g  Harper 1977  Roff 1992  have suggested that  pure  semelparity and iteroparity are endpoints of a continuum of modes of parity  This hypothesis predicts predictable variation in reproductive phenotypes within the  big bang  of semelparous reproduction  just as there exists variation between clutches of offspring in iteroparous organisms   Empirical support for the continuity hypothesis is sparse  particularly in semelparous organisms  Here  we report the results of three tests of the continuity hypothesis in the classically semelparous herb Lobelia inflata  Campanulaceae   First  we test the ability of L  inflata to exhibit variation in reproductive phenology and offspring traits in response to a manipulation of the timing of the initiation of reproduction  Second  we report observed differences in fruit development timing and offspring size among fruits produced at different times within the semelparous episode  Finally  we report the results of a lab study that explores the conditions under which L  inflata is capable of eliciting a second bout of reproduction  
Functional analysis of adaptive evolution of ADH in Drosophila  A goal in evolutionary genetics is to understand how changes at the sequence level produce changes in function and fitness  The Drosophila ADH protein provides a classic and tractable model for studying this issue   population genetic analysis of the Adh coding sequence indicated adaptive evolution  a hypothesis that is concordant with the expansion of D  melanogaster into alcohol rich environments  However  functional assays are necessary to establish whether the molecular signature of selection on Adh is causally related or merely correlated to the increased fitness of D  melanogaster in fermenting environments  We have therefore traced the evolution of ADH function in flies of the D  melanogaster subgroup using ancestral reconstruction and biochemical assays   In spite of ADH s essentiality in ethanol catabolism  we find that the protein has not functionally changed  The discordance between sequence and functional evolution broadly raises questions about our ability to ascertain adaptation from sequence patterns and correlative evidence  
A global analysis of water and nitrogen relationship between mistletoes and their hosts  broad scale tests of old and enduring hypotheses  The association between mistletoes and their hosts is a fascinating co evolutionary system  Mistletoes are parasitic angiosperms that connect to the host branch by a modified root called a haustorium  and acquire water and nutrients exclusively via the host xylem  Notably  mistletoes are known to use a vast amount of water for a given amount of carbon fixed during photosynthesis  low  water use efficiency   WUE    The  nitrogen parasitism hypothesis  posits that N would be the most limiting resource for mistletoes  so that they need to use more water  i e   faster transpiration rates  in order to acquire enough N from the hosts  In a rather different context  the   Mimicry hypothesis   arose in the literature suggesting that some mistletoes mimic their host s leaves morphology in order to avoid herbivory  and this allows them to accumulate larger amounts of leaf nitrogen  These two non exclusive hypotheses share this element of trying to explain patterns of mistletoe leaf N concentration  We set out to test the generality of both hypotheses at unprecedented scale  168 mistletoes host pairs  from 39 sites  and from all continents except Antarctica   drawing together literature data and our own field data for two key plant functional traits that represent N  leaf N concentration   long term WUE and degree of stomatal control  leaf carbon isotopic composition   13C   Key findings included  1  little support for the N parasitism hypothesis  higher nitrogen was not related to more similar  13C between hosts and mistletoes  and nitrogen alone does not explain the lower  13C exhibited by mistletoes   2  little support for the mimicry hypothesis  mimic mistletoes generally did not have greater N concentration  except when associated with N fixing hosts  More broadly  mistletoes showed the same shifts in leaf traits in relation to site climate as did their hosts  suggesting that mistletoes are similarly constrained by environmental drivers  
Reconstructing the Demographic History of AdŽlie Penguins  Pygoscelis adeliae  Using mtDNA and Coalescent Methods  AdŽlie penguins are distributed around coastal Antarctica and on nearby islands  Our goal was to infer how the population size has changed in response to global warming since the Last Glacial Maximum 23   19 ka before present  BP   An alignment of  650 mitochondrial D loop sequences of length 315 bp was assembled from sequences derived from modern and subfossil specimens collected from colonies around Antarctica  but predominantly from the Ross Sea  Analyses of the variation revealed no genetic structure beyond that previously identified as the ancient Ross Sea and Antarctica haplogroups  There is evidence for extensive gene flow among Ross Sea and adjacent colonies  Bayesian skyline plots indicate that the abundance of AdŽlie penguins began to increase  10 ka BP   8 ka after the temperature began to rise  and reached a peak during the penguin   optimum   4   2 ka BP  Changing availability of suitable sites for colonies arising from melting of the coastal ice sheet might explain the temporal dynamics of the species  
Rapid Divergence and Convergence of Functional Characters in Experimentally Evolved Populations of Drosophila  We have examined a wide range of functional characters in 30 outbred Drosophila melanogaster populations all of which descend from one common ancestral population   These populations have well known phylogenetic relationships and selection histories over the course of more than 30 years of sustained and replicated parallel selection   We have phenotypically compared these populations for the following functional characters  age specific adult mortality rates  age specific female fecundities  developmental timing  larval viability  starvation resistance  desiccation resistance  flight endurance  and cardiac performance   The 30 populations in this study include long established populations  ACO1 5   B1 5   and CO1 5  and newly established populations with corresponding recent selection regimes  AO1 5   BO1 5   and NCO1 5    The 15 ACO  B  and CO populations have been undergoing A  B  and C type selection for 737  837  and 290 generations  respectively   The 15 AO  BO  and NCO populations have been undergoing A  B  and C type selection for only 146  120  and 36 generations  respectively   These populations were used to determine  1  if phenotypic convergence has occurred between the long established and newly established populations recently sharing the same selection regime  and  2  whether the level of phenotypic divergence between the newly established populations is equivalent to the level of divergence between the long established populations despite the fewer number of generations of divergent selection  For most of the functional traits assayed  there was extensive convergence between parallel selected populations  whether the selection regime was long sustained or relatively recent   There was also rapid divergence among the populations newly subjected to the three different selection regimes   All told  these findings suggest that experimental evolution in outbreeding Mendelian populations can proceed with great rapidity   
Mean and Variance of Phylogenetic Trees  Mean and variance can be defined for a set or distribution of phylogenetic trees in a way that is analogous a definition in Euclidean space  but with the underlying space being the space of phylogenetic trees constructed by Billera  Holmes  and Vogtmann  2001    A property of this space  non positive curvature  ensures that there is a unique shortest path between any two trees  that the mean of a set of trees is unique  and that both can be practically computed   We compare the the mean and variance to existing consensus tree and summary methods  and show that the variance is particularly well behaved compared to other measures of variation  
Historical responses of Antarctic penguins and seals to climate change  It is estimated that 34  of Antarctic sea ice will be lost by 2100  greatly reducing the available habitat for predators that rely on sea ice for breeding and foraging  such as Emperor penguins and Weddell seals  In order to implement effective management plans for these animals we need a better understanding of the likely impacts of climate change  To address this need  we used genetic data to understand how populations have responded to past periods of climate change and their current adaptive capacity  The mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b were sequenced for 110 Weddell seals and 120 Emperor penguins from colonies across East Antarctica  Present day gene flow patterns for populations of seals and penguins were determined using FST to understand population structure and dispersal ability  We also used Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots in conjunction with a heterochronous dataset and molecular clock methods to investigate historical population trends and how these might be related to climate change  Despite their similar habitat requirements we found very different population structures for the two predators  In the case of Emperor penguins the entire 4000km of East Antarctica constitutes a single breeding population  overall FST    0 00472  p   0 553  pairwise FST amongst localities p > 0 05   In contrast  Weddell seals are significantly structured across the same spatial scale  overall FST   0 12602  p   0 000   This suggests that there are some barriers to dispersal for Weddell seals in this region  which may impede their ability to range shift under future climate change scenarios  In terms of demographic history we discovered that the East Antarctic Emperor penguin population has increased in abundance by a factor of four since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum  concurrent with rising air temperatures  Weddell seals show no concomitant increase  with the population remaining relatively stable throughout several climate fluctuations  This is intriguing given the apparently similar habitat niche for the two species  Overall these two ice dependent predators show very different responses to climate change and will require different management strategies despite their similar habitat   
 Inferring the phylogenetic relationships of early dipteran lineages based on more than 1 000 orthologous genes from transcriptome data    Phylogenetic relationships between the earliest evolving lineages of Brachycera are not resolved while there is no doubt that this is a monophyletic group  We present the first results of our phylogenomic analysis using more than 1 000 orthologous single copy genes derived from transcriptome data from the 1KITE project  using 40 terminal taxa spanning the phylogenetic region of interest  we aim to conduct partitioned analyses based on protein domains and optimized partitioning schemes to improve modeling during phylogenetic inference  We reduce the amount of missing data by selecting only partitions for phylogenetic inference that have the necessary taxon coverage for the question at hand  
Ecological opportunity is not sufficient to drive adaptive radiation in Caribbean pupfishes  Adaptive radiation is widely believed to result from ecological opportunity  abundant and under utilized resources due to colonization of a new habitat  mass extinction  or key innovation  Here I ask whether ecological opportunity alone is sufficient to explain two remarkably localized examples of adaptive radiation in Caribbean pupfishes  Spectacular diversification has occurred in only two isolated lake systems which exhibit all the features of classic adaptive radiation   1  rapid morphological diversification rates  2  trophic innovations such as scale eating  and 3  multiple fitness peaks on the adaptive landscape   However  a survey of similar lakes on neighboring islands suggests that ecology is not the full story   
Higher order epistasis between a mutation and four or more segregating variants generates a new phenotype in a cross  Recent research suggests that genetic interactions involving more than two loci may influence a number of complex traits  How these  higher order  interactions arise at the genetic and molecular levels remains an open question  To provide insights into this problem  we dissected a colony morphology phenotype that segregates in a yeast cross and results from synthetic higher order interactions  Using backcrossing and selective sequencing of progeny  we found five loci that collectively produce the trait  We fine mapped these loci to 22 genes in total and identified a single gene at each locus that caused loss of the phenotype when deleted  Complementation tests or allele replacements provided support for functional variation in these genes  and revealed that pre existing genetic variants and a spontaneous mutation interact to cause the trait  The causal genes have diverse functions in endocytosis  END3   oxidative stress response  TRR1   RAS cAMP signalling  IRA2   and transcriptional regulation of multicellular growth  FLO8 and MSS11   and for the most part have not previously been shown to exhibit functional relationships  Further efforts uncovered two additional loci that together can complement the non causal allele of END3  suggesting that multiple genotypes in the cross can specify the same phenotype  Our work sheds light on the complex genetic and molecular architecture of higher order interactions  shows how such interactions can generate new phenotypes  and raises questions about the broader contribution of such interactions to heritable trait variation  
 Functional traits  biomes  and diversification rates in the Rhamnaceae   Species diversification is inextricably linked to a lineage s intrinsic innovations and the extrinsic events it is exposed to over evolutionary time  However  the temporal sequence of these diversification  triggers   and their additive or interactive effects on speciation and extinction rates is unclear   Adaptations  are traits which evolve during or just after movement to new environments  whereas  exaptations  have evolved prior to the transition to the new environment  thereby facilitating this shift  In this study we investigate if functional trait syndromes evolved as adaptations or exaptations to biomes  and if those lineages possessing the trait syndrome in the associated biome diversify faster than lineages lacking the traits or not occurring in the particular biome  We test this in the Rhamnaceae  which occur as lianas or large trees with big leaves in tropical rainforests  as woody shrubs with small  sclerophyllous leaves and revolute margins in Mediterranean shrublands  and as spiny shrubs in deserts  We assembled trait and biome data for 759 Rhamnaceae species  70  of total species  and use a dated phylogeny  280 species  to define trait syndromes positively associated with the biomes  to test for correlated evolution between them  to reconstruct ancestral states to evaluate the temporal sequence of innovation and extrinsic opportunity  and to test for differential diversification rates between adapted and non adapted lineages  Results indicate correlated evolution between trait syndromes and biomes  and generally higher diversification rates of adapted compared to non adapted lineages  The sequence of evolutionary events  i e  adaptation or exaptation  in rainforests and deserts remains unclear  but we find strong evidence that the Mediterranean trait syndrome evolved as an adaptation to Mediterranean shrublands  Although both the Mediterranean biome and the trait syndrome individually increase diversification rates  a decreased speciation rate was detected for the interaction between the two  suggesting that well adapted  specialised lineages in Mediterranean shrublands may reach evolutionary dead ends  
Gymnosperm plastomes reveal rampant rearrangements and the retention of ndh pseudogenes in the Pinaceae  Chloroplast genomes are haploid uniparentally inherited molecules  useful for estimating divergence and tracking gene flow   Although chloroplast genome structure is highly stable across the majority of angiosperms  gymnosperm plastomes are labile  with extensive gene losses and rearrangements  typically associated with a reduction of the inverted repeat  This poses small challenges for assemblies  with experimental validation typically required for contig ordering  gap filling  and isoform confirmation   To assess plastome structure within a broad phylogenetic framework  chloroplast genomes were sequenced  assembled and validated from Abies sibirica  Gnetum gnemon  Juniperus communis  Picea abies  Picea glauca  Picea obovata  Pinus sylvestris  and Taxus baccata   All ndh genes were fully retained in J  communis and T  baccata  completely excised in G  gnemon  and progressively pseudogenized in P  sylvestris and A  sibirica  suggesting convergent losses in the Pinaceae and Gnetales  Similarly  the inverted repeat appears to be independently reduced in Pinaceae and Cupressophyte clades  While there was high structural conservation between the plastomes of A  sibirica  P  sylvestris  and G  gnemon with their closest relatives  rampant rearrangements were detected within Picea and the Cupressophytes  Two major inversions and two translocations were detected between Juniperus and relatives  including a major 36 kbp Juniperus specific inversion  flanked by two copies of trnQ and AT rich breakpoints  At least four inversions have occurred after the divergence of Taxus baccata and Cephalotaxus wilsoniana  the largest being 20 kbp  A deep phylogenetic split was detected within Picea abies  and polyphyly of the group confirmed with sequence data that spans the mitochondrial genome  We will highlight applications of chloroplast genomes to our understanding of divergence and gene flow within conifers  
 Genetic and phenotypic divergence in an island bird  isolation by distance  by colonization or by adaptation    Discerning the relative roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species  as well as how these processes interact  is a fundamental aim in biology  Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations  isolation by distance   of colonization history and founder effects  isolation by colonization  or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations  isolation by adaptation   We have attempted to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelots pipit  Anthus berthelotii   a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos  where multiple  morphologically distinct subspecies exist  We first estimate the demographic history of Berthelots pipit using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation  and quantify genetic and morphological structure  We then extend simple tests of isolation by distance and isolation by adaptation to cover isolation by colonization  allowing us to quantify the roles of migration  adaptation and founder effects at the genetic and phenotypic levels  Our approaches provide a useful framework for other studies aiming to understand the causes of population divergence 
Adaptation of a freshwater alga to marine conditions in the laboratory  Experimental evolution is most often used to study adaptation to slightly modified ecological conditions  Rarely have we been able to study how populations manage to adapt to novel ecological conditions  We have taken a freshwater alga  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and propagated it over time in ever increasing concentrations of salt  These experimental lines can now grow in levels of salinity that are way beyond what was available to the ancestors  And in fact  the lines are now capable of growth in seawater  We show that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation play a role in extending the range of salinities that sustain growth  We also show that there is a significant amount of variation among the independent lines  Thus the transition from freshwater to marine conditions has occurred following more than one trajectory  Adaptation to novel ecological conditions can occur over relatively short timescales in the laboratory  enabling us to gain more insight into such macroevolutionary processes   
Role of endosymbiotic gut bacteria of Hylobius abietis in the detoxification of terpenes  Mutualistic microbial partners of insects are commonly reported to be engaged in nutritional and defensive interactions with their hosts  However  they have also been described to be involved in the detoxification of noxious compounds contained in their host«s food source   This  although well described in symbioses between insects and fungus or yeasts  needs more support for mutualistic bacteria  So far  only one example of bacterial detoxification of a noxious compound has been demonstrated in insects  showing experimentally that pesticide resistant strains of Burkholderia can establish stable symbiotic relationships with broad headed bugs conferring them resistance  The pine weevil  Hylobius abietis  Coleoptera  feeds on bark and phloem of Norway spruce  Picea abies   which contains resin ducts filled with a complex mixture of resin acids   Ingested mono  sesqui and diterpenes  conifer main secondary metabolites  can cause neural damage and disruption of gut membranes in insects  However  they seem to have no negative effect on H  abietis  We are interested in how the large pine weevil copes with the terpenes in the host bark and cambium  Preliminary studies have shown that weevils do not avoid terpenoid containing tissues and that antibiotic treated individuals cannot digest these compounds as efficiently as non treated ones suggesting a possible role of symbiotic bacteria in terpene detoxification  To identify putative detoxifying candidates we have characterized the gut microbial community from weevils from different geographical areas  both using culture dependent and independent methods   Our results show a geographically stable community dominated by Enterobacteria and Firmicutes similar to that of bark beetles occupying similar ecological niches  Additionally  we have isolated and purified the natural mixture of diterpenes present in bark and are using a transcriptomic approach on artificial diet with and without this mixture to identify the enzymes involved in terpene degradation  In addition  we can supplement an artificial diet with a pure C13 labeled diterpene mixture to identify the metabolic products of the detoxification and whether they are used as nutrients and are incorporated into the insect tissues  Elucidating the fate of these compounds will shed some light on how insects cope with plant induced defenses and how some symbionts allow their hosts to exploit otherwise inaccessible food sources  
Natural variation in seed germination speed of Arabidopsis thaliana  complex genetic architecture and response to strong selection  Natural variation in seed germination speed of Arabidopsis thaliana  complex genetic architecture and response to strong selection The natural variation of the timing of developmental transitions associated with life history traits provides sources for  and reflects the outcome of adaptation  Germination timing of seeds is a key turning point during the plant life history with consequences in fitness and adaptation  Germination speed  i e  the time lapse from reception of favorable germination cues to emergence of the earliest seedling cohort   is an integral component of germination timing  and exhibits strong correlation with plant s fitness under competition and fluctuating environment  We characterized quantitative natural variation in germination speed among a worldwide collection of 17 Arabidopsis thaliana natural accessions  under both regular and saline conditions  and found that germination speed is environmentally sensitive and density dependent  To dissect the genetic architecture of germination speed  we implemented the novel yeast eXtreme QTL  X QTL  mapping technique  Ehrenreich et al  2010  in A  thaliana  Using population based phenotyping and high throughput bulk segregant genotyping  we overcame the lack of detection power of traditional QTL mapping methods whose resolution is limited by the number of recombination events  Rapid germinant pools sampled from replicates of 100 000 segregating seeds revealed 4 X QTLs for rapid germination under normal conditions and 18 X QTLs under extreme saline conditions  Based on low coverage next generation resequencing of individual fast germinating segregants  we annotated a 150 kb flanking genomic sequences on both sides of the X QTL peak positions  Genomic polymorphism and germination transcriptomic data were collected from both parental accessions  which enabled the identification of several strong candidate genes  Our project uncovers the complex genetic architecture of germination speed natural variation  its gene by environment interaction  and establishes the X QTL mapping in a multicellular eukaryotic organism  
The role of extinction in the assembly of large scale biodiversity patterns  Understanding how transoceanic disjunct distributions  closely related organisms scattered across continents  came to be has shaped biogeography as a science from the old vicariance paradigm  where a once continuous biota was fragmented by Earth tectonic events  to a more recent molecular based hypotheses of long distance dispersal across oceanic barriers  Compared to these disjunctions  large scale continental disjunctions  closely related taxa scattered within a continent   have received less attention  The barriers in this case are not so much geographical  e g   an ocean basin  but ecological  the existence of stretches of inhospitable land that are outside the ancestral climatic tolerance of a given organism  One of the best examples of this distribution is the African  Rand Flora   aka   Rim Flora    a floristic pattern that relates plant species disjunctly distributed in the continental margins of Africa  i e   Macaronesia NW Africa  Horn of Africa South Arabia  Eastern Africa  and South Africa   separated by the tropical lowlands of Central Africa and the arid terrains of the Sahara Desert in the north and the Kalahari Desert in the south  Traditionally  this disjunction has been explained by fragmentation of an ancient widespread African flora by aridification driven vicariance events  leaving relict taxa in  climatic refuges  in the eastern and western margins of Africa  but recent molecular studies point to independent dispersal events from neighboring regions  The molecular revolution and the possibility of integrating time into biogeographic reconstructions have enabled testing these alternative hypotheses within a spatio temporal framework  Continental disjunctions are especially interesting for understanding the role of extinction in the assembly of global biodiversity patterns because  as with the Rand Flora  they are often attributed to large scale climatic events that would have extirpated intermediate populations from a once continuous distribution  leaving relicts on either side of the disjunction  Unlike lineage extinction that is clade specific  these extinction events are clade wide  affecting unrelated lineages that may differ in their ecological requirements  dispersal mode  or age  In here  we show results from our Rand Flora project in which we attempt to estimate extinction rates across unrelated flowering plant lineages   
Testing the roles of orogeny and habitat heterogeneity  in driving allopatry in mid elevation frogs  Aromobatidae  Rheobates   of the northern Andes  Orogenic processes and Pleistocene climate fluctuations have been proposed as some of the  main mechanisms to explain the high diversity and endemism for animals and plants in the Northern Andes  In this study we investigate and evaluate the role of Andean high peaks and the low Magdalena Valley in creating barriers to dispersal and promoting vicariance within the mid elevation Andean frog genus Rheobates  Anura  Aromobatidae   endemic to Colombia  The frogs of this genus inhabit the flanks of the Eastern Cordillera  eastern and western   and the eastern flank of the Central Cordillera at an altitudinal range of 350 2200 metres above sea level  The two Cordilleras are separated by the Magdalena River Valley  while a continuous string of high mountain peaks above 2500 metres separate the flanks of the Eastern Cordillera  The disjunct distribution of Rheobates suggests that gene flow is restricted between populations living on different Cordilleras and on opposite flanks within the Eastern Cordillera  We analysed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from 37 individuals of Rheobates  Anura  Aromobatidae  to infer phylogenetic relationships  divergence times and ancestral areas  Additionally  we tested the role of climatic variables in determining the present geographical boundaries of the species using species distribution models   We found that phylogeny of Rheobates is largely predicted by geography  with one population from the eastern flank of the Eastern Cordillera sharing a common ancestor with all other Rheobates 21 million years ago  Ma  95  credible interval 31 10 Ma   Populations in the Cordillera Central were monophyletic  isolated across the Magdalena Valley with a divergence time estimated at 13 Ma  19 7 Ma   We also detected one recent crossing of the Eastern Cordillera  along with unanticipated latitudinal phylogeographic structure within the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera  Environmental niche tests indicated that the Magdalena Valley and the high peaks of the Eastern Cordillera are significant environmental barriers to Rheobates populations  Our study offers broad support for the classic mountain orogeny model of vicariant divergence  but suggests that lowland habitat heterogeneity may also have played a long term role in promoting vicariance  despite a long history of palaeo climatic fluctuations    Key words  Andean uplift  Colombia  disjunct distribution  divergence times  molecular phylogenetics  phylogeography  Rheobates  vicariance   
Testing the Meiotic Requirement for Recombination  The rate of meiotic recombination is one of the most important quantities in genetics and evolution  Recent studies have shed light on the mechanisms and patterning of recombination across genomes  including the identification of genes that control the rate and distribution of crossing over  Despite these notable advances  one very basic question remains unanswered  What is the fundamental meiotic requirement for recombination  Some scientists have argued that a minimum of one crossover per chromosome is needed to ensure that homologous chromosomes correctly segregate at meiosis  A second camp has suggested that the physical constraint on crossing over lies at the level of the chromosome arm  Genetic linkage maps and cytogenetic recombination maps that catalog the distribution and frequency of recombination have been developed for hundreds of diverse species genomes  Surprisingly  these resources have never been systematically mined to resolve this open debate  Here  I combine meta analysis of over 100 published recombination maps from diverse eukaryotic taxa with cutting edge cytogenetic methods for in situ imaging of crossover events to comprehensively test the meiotic requirement for recombination at meiosis  My preliminary findings suggest that the physical scale of crossover constraint may vary across the eukaryotic phylogeny  with some species requiring just one crossover per chromosome and others with a more stringent criterion of at least one crossover per chromosome arm  These tentative results  if robust to further analyses  will carry important consequences for understanding global crossover rate variation  including its coevolutionary response to chromosome rearrangements and species differences in the frequency of chromosome nondisjunction  
Evolution of petal fusion in asterids core eudicots  Petal fusion  sympetaly  is hypothesized as a key innovation in flowers that enhances means for isolation mechanism in pollination and hence promotes the speciation rates   Sympetaly has evolved multiple times during the diversification of flowering plants  The most striking plant lineage with ancestrally fused petals is the asterid clade of the core eudicots that comprises one fourth of the diversity of flowering plants   Though the genetic basis of sympetaly remains poorly known  studies in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana  Brassicaceae   rosid  and Petunia x hybrid  Solanaceae  asterid I  have revealed candidate genes that may have evolved a function in the origin and maintenance of sympetaly  In this study  we hypothesized that orthologs of Arabidopsis or petunia floral organ boundary genes have diversified in expression and or function to affect the transition to sympetaly in asterids  Specifically  we tested the expression and or characterized the function of five organ boundary genes in three focal species from three major subclades of asterids  in that petunia has a sympetalous petals  lettuce  Lactuca sativa  Asteraceae  asterid II  has both fused and unfused petals  and an early diverging asterid carnation  Dianthus caryophyllus  Caryophyllaceae  lacks fused petals  
The soft shoulder effect  spurious signatures of soft and partial selective sweeps result from linked hard sweeps  Characterizing the nature of the adaptive process at the genetic level is a central goal for population genetics  In particular  we know little about the sources of adaptive substitution  Historically  population geneticists have focused attention on the hard sweep model of adaptation in which a de novo beneficial mutation arises and rapidly fixes in a population  e g  Maynard Smith and Haigh 1974   Recently more attention has been given to soft sweep models  in which alleles that were previously neutral  or nearly so  drift until such a time as the environment shifts and their selection coefficient changes to become beneficial  e g  Hermisson and Pennings 2005   It remains an active and difficult problem however to tease apart the tell tale signatures of hard vs  soft sweeps in genomic polymorphism data  Through extensive simulations of hard and soft sweep models  here we show that indeed the two might not be separable through the use of univariate summaries  In particular it seems that recombination in regions linked to  but distant from  sites of hard sweeps can create patterns of polymorphism that closely mirror what is expected to be found near soft sweeps  This problem of  soft shoulders  suggests that we currently have only a very limited ability to differentiate soft vs  hard sweep scenarios in molecular population genomics data  particularly when the targets of selection are not known a priori  e g  genome wide scans   Further we find a very similar shoulder effect confounds haplotype based statistics that are aimed at detecting partial or ongoing selective sweeps  
Late evolutionary origin of modern bird flight inferred from shoulder allometry  The evolution of powered flight  defined as the capacity to sustain level aerial locomotion by flapping wings as in crown clade birds  was a pivotal event in dinosaur evolution  and played a major role in the ascendancy of birds to their current position as the most diverse and widely distributed tetrapods  Understanding the pattern of powered flight acquisition has become a key goal in dinosaur paleobiology  with the flying potential of early avialans  such as Archaeopteryx  inspiring debate since the 19th Century  Understanding  of powered flight capacity on the avian stem has  however  been limited by two primary factors  the uncritical application of poorly constrained mass estimates to Mesozoic stem birds  and the difficulty of identifying accurate osteological correlates of flying ability  Here  an analysis of shoulder joint dimensions and body mass in over 1 000 extant birds and several Mesozoic avialans appears to delineate functional flying and flightless zones  enabling explicit tests of flying potential in stem birds  By incorporating broad 95  prediction intervals on mass estimates for stem birds  this approach enables the incorporation of statistical uncertainty in inferences of flying ability  This approach casts doubt on the powered flying potential of early Mesozoic avialans such as Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis  and indicates that the powered flying ability of modern birds arose considerably later than is often assumed  These data clarify the stepwise sequence by which flight related modifications accrued on the avian stem  e g   the evolution of asymmetrical pennaceous feathers and a pygostyle appear to predate the origin of powered flapping flight   and bring us closer to a more complete understanding of one of the great macroevolutionary transitions in the history of life  
Identifying genes affecting both adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation in Howea palms from Lord Howe Island using RNA Seq  Howea belmoreana and Howea forsteriana are sister species of palm tree  both endemic to Lord Howe Island  LHI  located in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand  Originally composed of solely volcanic substrate  the deposition of calcareous soil on LHI is thought to have led to ecological speciation  Currently  H  belmoreana adults are restricted to volcanic soils  whilst H  forsteriana is also found on the younger calcarenite soil  There are several ecological differences between these habitats  the calcareous soils on LHI are dryer  have higher pH  increased salinity and show stark differences in metal composition compared to volcanic soil  The species are largely reproductively isolated with a five week difference in peak flowering time in the wild and when cultivated ex situ  Differences in the peak flowering times are also maintained regardless of the soil type that H  forsteriana occurs on  Genes that have a dual role in controlling ecological adaptation and flowering time may have played a direct role in Howea speciation  To characterise such pleiotropic genes we first used RNA Seq to identify differentially expressed genes between the Howea species using three tissue types  floral  leaf and root  sampled from 36 trees distributed across LHI  As we know that current phenological differences between the species are not a result of environmental induced plasticity  we targeted genes that were significantly differentially expressed  and which were consistently expressed at a higher level in all individuals of one of the species  Using this criterion  191 genes were identified of varied known function  Of these 15 had gene ontologies associated with the ecological differences between the species and or flowering time divergence  Finally  the effect these 15 genes have on flowering time in Arabidopsis knockout mutants was observed  Three were shown to have the expected effect on flowering phenology  and one of these genes  SAL1  has previously been shown to alter drought and salt stress tolerance when inactivated  Overall  we have identified pleiotropic genes that represent a plausible mechanism to drive ecological speciation in Howea           
A new dynamic model for the phylogenetic assembly of the ecological community  The application of phylogenetic data to community ecology has promised to provide new insights into the mechanisms structuring community assembly  However  progress has been hindered by a reliance on static null models that ignore the dynamic context within which assembly takes place  Here we address this by developing a new time based model of community assembly by colonisation and local extinction  with speciation taking place in the wider species pool  We show that accounting for these processes fundamentally alters the phylogenetic structure of communities expected due to chance  We demonstrate how this new dynamic model can be used to infer both the historical rates of community assembly and the role of niche based mechanisms in regulating community structure  We argue that a new generation of dynamic phylogenetic null models can greatly advance our understanding of the processes governing ecological communities    
Natural selection helps explain the unexpectedly small range of neutral diversity among species   The observation that levels of neutral diversity do not vary nearly as much among species as expected due to the vast range of census population sizes is perhaps the most puzzling and enduring paradox of molecular population genetics  Under a simple neutral Wright Fisher model  levels of polymorphism within a species are expected to be directly proportional to the population size times the mutation rate  However  even allowing for demographic effects that can reduce the effective population size below the census population size  observed neutral diversity within species falls in an extremely compact range compared to the range of population sizes  One plausible contributor to this difference is the operation of natural selection in the genome  Both background selection and positive selection purge genetic variation from populations  and because natural selection is more effective in larger populations  we may expect larger populations to purge disproportionately more variation  Because selection at one site will also affect linked sites  genomic regions that recombine infrequently tend to harbor little polymorphism  The resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism has been reported in a number of species  offers an appealing means of quantifying the effect of selection on polymorphism throughout the genome  and makes testable predictions towards that goal  Specifically  species with larger census population sizes will experience stronger effects of selection on linked sites and will tend to demonstrate stronger correlations between levels of polymorphism and local rates of recombination   To explore this hypothesis  we identified 40 species  including plants  insects  nematodes  and vertebrates  that have sufficiently high quality reference genomes  polymorphism data  and genetic maps to enable genome wide comparisons between polymorphism and recombination rates  In total we aligned more than 30 billion short reads and across all linkage maps we analyzed recombination between more than 30 thousand markers  After developing a robust alignment and genotyping pipeline  and curating genetic maps  we computed the correlation between levels of synonymous site polymorphism and the local recombination rate for each species  Overall  the data are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection truncates the distribution of neutral diversity at silent sites  As an example  one primary result is that invertebrates  which tend to have large census population sizes  have significantly stronger correlations between recombination and nucleotide diversity than vertebrates  This and other results therefore provide empirical support for the hypothesis that the action of natural selection plays an important role in limiting the range of neutral diversity observed among species  helping to finally resolve this longstanding paradox  
Fight Fire with Fire  Redirected Meiotic Drive in Drosophila affinis subgroup  Fisherian sex ratios are the general rule in biology   Fisher proposed that independent of the mating system or sex determination system  strong frequency dependent selection will always favor even sex ratios in panmictic populations   Thus  any genetic tendency towards producing one sex will not be advantageous in the long run   However  sex chromosome meiotic drive  where males carrying the sex ratio locus on the X chromosome  XD  have predominately female offspring  is commonly observed in the Drosophila obscura group   The persistence of XD chromosomes causes long term intragenomic conflict favoring the evolution of suppressors to restore even transmission of X and Y bearing gametes   The Drosophila affinis subgroup is particularly notable for its multiple XD chromosomes and suppression associated Y chromosome polymorphism   Even more surprising is the phenomenon of redirected drive  where males carrying the XD chromosome with a particular genetic background have predominately male offspring  reversing the phenotypic effect of the sex ratio locus   Redirected drive has only been documented in D  affinis and was previously shown to be the result of another anomaly in this species  XO male fertility   I present evidence for redirected drive in the closely related species D  athabasca where XO males are sterile   Experimental crosses are consistent with an autosomal recessive gene interacting with the XD chromosome to cause redirection of the sex chromosome drive  Using population genetic models I evaluate the conditions for selective maintenance of polymorphism at this autosomal locus   This work demonstrates that even though Fisher s Principle may predict long term evolutionarily stable states  transient phases of sex ratio distortion can have major impact on maintenance of genetic polymorphism and genome evolution  
Geographic history of long distance seasonal migration in the largest New World radiation of migratory birds  Determining where species arose and how they spread across the globe is paramount to understanding geographic patterns of biodiversity  For migratory organisms  this task has been difficult due to the complex geography of seasonal migration  migratory species exhibit seasonal variation in their geographic ranges  often inhabiting geographically and ecologically distinct breeding and nonbreeding areas  The complicated geography of seasonal migration has long posed a challenge for inferring the geographic origins of migratory species as well as evolutionary sequences of change in migratory behavior  For example  one longstanding hypothesis is that migratory animals originated in the tropics and migration evolved through shifts of breeding ranges to temperate regions  To test this hypothesis  we developed the first phylogenetic model of the joint evolution of breeding and non breeding  winter  ranges of migratory species  Our model   which we term the Domino Model   is inspired by the dispersal extinction cladogenesis model of geographic range evolution  in which geographic range evolves via dispersal and local extinction along phylogenetic branches and via inheritance and subdivision at speciation events  The Domino Model follows similar logic  but is novel in jointly considering the evolution of both the breeding and winter range  To analyze the model s results  we implemented a novel application of graph theory for phylogenetic character analysis  We applied our model to the inference of biogeographic history in the largest New World radiation of migratory birds  the emberizoid passerine birds  We found that seasonal migration between breeding ranges in North America and winter ranges in the Neotropics evolved primarily via shifts of winter ranges towards the tropics from ancestral ranges in North America  This result contrasts with an entrenched paradigm that hypothesized migration evolving out of the tropics via shifts of the breeding ranges  We also show that major lineages of tropical  sedentary emberizoids are derived from northern  migratory ancestors and that seasonal migration promoted colonization of the tropics from North America   Author contributions  for student award consideration    Ben Winger  student  is the first author  he conceived of and developed the project  analyzed the data  and wrote the manuscript  Keith Barker  second author  contributed a phylogenetic tree of the emberizoids used for analysis  Richard Ree  third author  assisted with implementation and development of the model  study design  and data analysis   
Evidence for multiple barriers to reproduction between edaphic specialist populations of an Amazonian Tree  Protium subserratum  Burseraceae   Disentangling the strength and importance of barriers to reproduction that arise between diverging lineages is central to our understanding of diversification  To date  only a handful of studies have comprehensively quantified the strength of individual reproductive isolating mechanisms among closely related plant species  Even fewer studies have focused on tropical plants and those have focused on herbaceous lineages  In this study we examine multiple barriers to reproduction between diverging lineages of soil specialist ecotypes of Protium subserratum  Burseraceae   an Amazonian tropical tree  Specifically we aimed to  1  Quantify the contributions of pre zygotic and post zygotic barriers to isolation including ecogeographic isolation  flowering phenology  pollinator assemblage  pollen adhesion  pollen germination  pollen tube growth  fertilization initial seed development and hybrid fitness and  2  Calculate the total amount of reproductive isolation as well as the relative contribution of each barrier to total reproductive isolation  We were able to identify four active barriers to reproduction including ecogeographic isolation  differential pollen adhesion  differences in pollinator assemblages  and low levels of hybrid seed development  We demonstrate that a combination of pre zygotic and post zygotic barriers to reproduction act to maintain near complete reproductive isolation between edaphically divergent populations of P  subserratum   
New Insights on Linyphiinae phylogeny  Araneae  Linyphiidae    Linyphiidae is one of the most speciose lineages of spiders and the most speciose family within the Orbiculariae clade  a large lineage that includes  among others  the ecribellate orbweavers  Despite a large history of work in this group  the internal arrangement of linyphiids was never satisfactorily resolved and only two of its seven accepted subfamilies possess strong evidence of monophyly  We added to the most comprehensive phylogeny of the group  Arnedo et al 2009  10 more taxa  focusing on low supported groups or of uncertain placement   25 new morphological characters and 3 more genes  18S  28S and H3  and run an analysis under both parsimony and Bayesian frameworks  The results shown here are a preliminary analysis of a larger and more robust phylogenetic hypothesis still in preparation  
Diversification of seepage salamanders across a complex geologic landscape  The seepage salamander  Desmognathus aeneus  occupies many distinct physiographic regions and several independent river drainage basins   Within this range  seepage salamander populations tend to be localized and most are apparently disjunct   The disjunct nature of these populations coupled with the complex geological and ecological history of the region occupied by these salamanders provides conditions which are conducive to lineage diversification    During the course of a range wide survey of seepage salamander  we visited nearly every historical site from which this species has been reported  in addition we discovered many previously unknown populations   Here we report the first phylogeographic survey of these minute salamanders   A Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genes reveals the presence of several well supported  distinct evolutionary lineages   The presence of multiple lineages within seepage salamanders has important conservation implications  
Do female dung flies minimize harm by preferring subordinate males   Subordinate males are predicted to adopt alternative mating tactics  AMTs  that bypass male male competition when doing so maximizes fitness  Many studies of these systems therefore investigate male male interactions  the reproductive consequences for males adopting AMTs  and the maintenance of phenotypic variability  however  considerably less attention has been paid to understanding the impacts of AMTs on female fitness  e g   via increased frequency of mating attempts and exposure to a greater diversity of male phenotypes  or whether female preferences are important in the evolution or suppression of male AMTs  To the extent that preferences in these systems are considered it is often with the assumption that females should prefer competitively dominant males to obtain direct and or indirect benefits  but evidence for these hypotheses is equivocal  In the yellow dung fly  Scathophaga stercoraria  males adopt alternative competitor patroller mating tactics in which large males primarily compete on dung pats  oviposition substrate  for gravid females  whereas small males avoid dung and instead search for females at feeding sites  e g   rotting fruit  where agonistic encounters are absent  Larger  competitor  males are also present at feeding sites in roughly equal proportion to small  patroller  males and opportunistically attempt copula when foraging  nevertheless  small males monopolize most matings in this environment due in part to greater female resistance in response to mating attempts by large males  One possible explanation for this surprising pattern of discrimination is that large males inflict greater direct harm on females which outweighs the costs of resistance  Therefore  we investigate the effects of male size and mating rate on female lifespan  lifetime reproductive output and wing damage in S  stercoraria to gain insights into how mating patterns associated with AMTs influence female fitness  as well as the adaptive significance of the small male preference observed in this species   
Impacts of anthropogenic disturbance to phenotypic traits under selection in incipient speciation  An active dynamic exists between phenotypes and local habitats whereby over time selection works to shape species such that their fitness is often increased by adaptiving to local conditions  Local habitats not only serve as the setting by which phenotypic signals are perceived  but can can also the source of traits that can influence them   Disturbance due to anthropogenic land use may change not only the signaling environment  but also the fitness landscape of a species   The Panamanian poison frog Dendrobates pumilio displays an impressive variety of rapidly diverged color patterns throughout a relatively small geographic range    Aposematic  coloration is thought to be central to reproductive isolation between population where phenotypic divergence is thought to be generated and maintained by the product of prezygotic isolation via female mate choice and postzygotic isolation via predatory avoidance to honest aposematic signaling   Here we show the effects local microhabitats have on the availability of exogenous resources such as defensive alkloids  and fitness and color influencing carotenoids   We put these differences into context using visual modeling techniques to infer how disturbance effects divergent traits under selection  
Strong selection drives reinforcement in Phlox  Reinforcement  the process of increased reproductive isolation due to selection against hybridization  is an important mechanism through which natural selection acts during speciation  The strength of selection driving reinforcement  however  has never been measured in a natural system  We quantify the strength of reinforcing selection in the native Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii using a strategy that weds a model with data   Reinforcement in this system is caused by variation in two loci that effect flower color  We quantify a sharp cline in flower color where this species comes into contact with its congener  P  cuspidata   We develop a spatially explicit population genetic model for these clines based on the genetics of flower color variation P  drummondii   By fitting this model to field observations  we find that selection on flower color genes generated by reinforcement is exceptionally strong  Our findings show that natural selection can play a decisive role in the evolution of reproductive isolation through the process of reinforcement    
Genome wide scans for signals of molecular adaptation in polar bear  The development of high throughput sequencing technology has facilitated an increase in genome level analyses of domesticated animals and non model species  These analyses have included identification of candidate genes associated with economic and ecological traits to help understanding the genetic underpinnings of species diversification and adaptive evolution  The polar bear is a prime example of adaptive evolution in response to the extremes of life in the high Arctic  These adaptations include mechanisms that allow them to maintain homeostasis under low temperatures and during times of fasting  and extend from evident morphological features to more subtle physiological traits  The polar bear and its closest relative  the lower latitude brown bear  diverged relatively recently and open questions remain whether candidate genes and positive selection played a significant impact in the evolution of the polar bear  We are using different approaches to examine the polar  brown and black bear nuclear genomes to identify candidate genes involved in adaptation to life in the Arctic environment  Based on enrichment of functional categories in genes with fixed variants in polar bears  we recently found evidence for adaptations related to cellular respiration  Expanded scans for positive selection comparing the polar bear genome with genomes of panda and dog have identified >2000 genes  and when including draft genomes of brown and black bear  26 candidate genes are found to be under positive selection in polar bear  With more targeted analyses of selected  candidate genes associated with lipid metabolism  hibernation  and pigmentation we have identified possible genes of importance in the functional divergence of the polar bear  This study highlights that genome wide scans can be limited in statistical power and accuracy due to recent speciation  the lack of high quality  annotated genomes and incomplete gene models when relying on large scale analyses and automated construction of alignments of large numbers of homologous gene families  Careful sampling and curation of alignments in analyses of de novo  non model draft genomes is imperative  
Chloroplast genome sequencing from extinct and endangered Hawaiian mints and their New World relatives  Lamiaceae   The endemic mints represent one of the largest plant lineages in the Hawaiian Islands  Since their divergence from New World mints  4 million years ago they have diversified into a group of 60 species in three genera and represent a remarkable array of eco  and phenotypes  Today  many members of this group are endangered or already extinct and therefore primarily known and available only from herbarium samples collected during the last century  Phylogenetic analyses have been utilized with a gene by gene approach to investigate evolution in this lineage  but its recent diversification means that sequence divergence  and hence phylogenetic resolution  is low  Therefore  a genomic approach is necessary to gain a better understanding of the rapid diversification of this lineage  but genetic resources are limited and no genome wide analyses have been generated for close relatives of the Hawaiian mints  We used a next generation sequencing approach to obtain a high quality  50x coverage   complete plastid genome   150Kb  from an extinct Hawaiian mint species  Stenogyne haliakalae  By resequencing of close relatives  we have generated 10 additional complete genomes and up to 86  genomic coverage for four other species  including from 100 year old herbarium material  Although high throughput technologies allow for sequencing of multiple  complete chloroplast genomes it may not be a cost effective approach in closely related  recently diverged species where use of historical material is necessary and genetic differentiation at even the genome scale is limited  In order to target hypervariable regions  we targeted  100 SNPs from throughout the chloroplast genome in 96 mint species using a next generation amplicon sequencing approach  This approach generated  20Kb sequence data per individual and increased the total number of variable sites among the sequenced species to  1 000  Amplification of even more distant relatives was successful and analysis of such hypervariable regions using high throughput sequencing demonstrate the potential of such an approach in rapidly evolved lineages  
Transcriptomic and morphometric analyses of recently evolved sympatric Arctic charr morphs  After the end of the last glacial period  about 10 000 years ago  many northern freshwater fishes invaded new habitats  Recurrent evolution of benthic pelagic resource specializations is seen in many species  including Arctic charr  Salvelinus alpinus   In Iceland  dwarf form with benthic morphotype has evolved repeatedly and is often found in sympatry with pelagic charr  Using Illumina sequencing and morphometrics we studied the developmental differences between three sympatric charr morphs from Lake Thingvallavatn  two benthic a large  LB  and a small  SB  as well as a small pelagic charr  PL   At expression level the most difference is between the LB charr and the smaller two forms  SB and PL   However at the genetic level  the two benthic forms cluster together  We have confirmed genetic and expression differences for dozens of genes that relate to several aspects of craniofacial development and resource polymorphism  In parallel we did morphometric analyses on developing embryos  with landmarks summarizing jaw morphology  the ethmoid plate  and gill arches  The data show significant differences between morphs in several craniofacial elements  even before hatching  We also analyzed the morphology in developing hybrids of small pelagic and small benthic charr  Those reveal curious patterns in shape divergence and growth  that will be discussed in the context of data that show relatively restricted gene flow between these sympatric morphs  
 The total inventory of Cuatro CiŽnegas  Coahuila  Mexico   Patterns and evolutionary causes of high diversity of an oligotrophic aquatic ecosystem   Cuatro CiŽnegas   CC  Basin is a very diverse and unique site  despite its high nutrient limitations  Previous metagenomic studies compared the taxonomical and functional diversity of microorganisms in four sites within the basin  finding large and distinct diversity in each site  suggesting that it is precisely the oligotrophic nature of the site the reason underlying such diversity  We believe that low P can enforce reproductive isolation and nutrient recycling promotes community cohesion  and that effective migration and establishment of newcomers to such communities is extremely rare due to a series of competitive mechanisms and negative interactions  and to the fact that external source of DNA is an important source of P in these populations   Herein we give the first glimpse of the total inventories of Churince  an enclosed hydrological system within the CC Basin  where bacterial  micro eukarionts  virus  fungi  invertebrates  animals and plants have been surveyed for 3 years in different seasons  using molecular ecology and evolutionary methods   We found an extraordinary diversity  even at the local level  in a scale of few meters  and a very large heterogeneity between sites at the different taxonomical levels  We believe that this system has evolved so many species due to the fact that local interactions have split the niche in very small bits and that the lack of bacterial sex and effective migration keeps microevolution at the local level  
Population genetic and genomic identification of locally adapted loci  The increasing availability of genomic data for non model organisms has led to a proliferation of methods for identifying locally adapted gene regions using high density marker data sampled across a species geographic range a class of methods broadly described as landscape genomics  Using population genetic data generated in a simulation of selection exerted by clinal environmental variation  I compare the power of several proposed methods to distinguish a selected locus from the rest of the genome  and determine how the detection of locally adapted loci is improved by consideration of genomic context  
Changes in gene regulation associated with reproductive isolation in house mice  Understanding the genetic basis of speciation lies at the heart of evolutionary biology  While the majority of research in this area has focused on identifying incompatibilities between protein coding genes  negative epistatic interactions between divergent regulatory elements may also contribute to reproductive isolation  Here we characterize regulatory divergence between the partially reproductively isolated house mouse subspecies  Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus   One direction of a cross between these subspecies produces sterile F1 males  while the reciprocal cross produces fertile F1 males   Whole testis transcriptome data was used to quantify gene expression levels in wild derived inbred lines of M  m  musculus  M  m  domesticus  fertile F1 males  and sterile F1 males  This allowed us to identify genes that were misexpressed in sterile hybrids  Expression divergence between the subspecies was categorized as cis   trans   or some combination based on differential expression between the parents and allele specific expression in the fertile F1 hybrid  Genes with expression outside the range of the parents in the sterile hybrid were identified as misexpressed  Comparison of these data sets provides insight into how divergent regulatory machinery contributes to hybrid dysregulation  
Variation and duplication of the DQB MHC class II gene in Gulf of California blue whale  Balaenoptera musculus  Population   The Major Histocompatibility Complex  MHC  is a multigenic family that is central to the immune response in vertebrates  MHC genes are generally thought to be under strong balancing selection from pathogens  as a result they are often among the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates genomes  Among mammals  MHC variation is reportedly lower among cetaceans  leading to speculation that the marine environment imposes reduced pathogen pressure compared to terrestrial habitats  As a first step toward exploring this hypothesis  we characterized MHC variability in a population of blue whales  Balaenoptera musculus   Specifically we genotyped exon 2 of the MHC Class II DQB locus for 80 Pacific blue whales resident in the Gulf of California during winter and spring  Twenty two putatively functional DQB variants were identified  all of these variants were homologous with cetacean DQB sequences and none contained insertions or deletions  Up to 5 DQB alleles per individual were identified  suggesting duplication of the DQB locus  When all variants were considered  20 polymorphic sites were evident  Overall haplotype diversity in the study population was the highest reported among baleen whales  suborder Mysticety  h 0 867   Estimates of rates of non synonymous to synonymous substitutions    93  and neutrality tests provided potential evidence of strong positive selection acting on the peptide binding region of this exon  Phylogenetic analyses of DQB allele sequences revealed the occurrence of trans specific evolution within cetaceans although no alleles were shared between species  This suggests that selection on this locus has acted over an extended period of time  Collectively  these findings reveal that immunogenetic variation in marine mammals is not always limited  thereby providing potential evidence against the hypothesis that marine taxa face reduced pathogen challenges   Key words  Balaenoptera musculus  DQB  gen duplication  Major Histocompatibility Complex  PBR  positive selection  
The Genomic Architecture of Adaptive Quantitative Trait Variation in Darwin s Finches  Revealing the genomic architecture of quantitative ecological traits has remained an elusive goal   We used a novel comparative landscape approach among species to reveal the genetic basis of adaptive differences in Darwin s finches  Geospiza  that differ primarily with regard to beak shape  The long history of hybridization  purifying selection  gene flow and recombination among dozens of island populations allows us to isolate the genetic genomic loci that distinguish these species  Genome wide contrasts among four species revealed 526 significant polymorphisms that cluster near the start of the mRNA transcripts of 392 genes  These genes are highly enriched for craniofacial and developmental processes and have a rich history of interaction with genes known to affect beak shape  The surprisingly large number of genes and their prevalance in regulation suggests evolutionary divergence primarily involves changes in tissue specific gene expression through transcriptional modifiers and enhancers  Variation at these adaptive loci mirror patterns of morphological allometry  The cactus finch lies away from evolutionary lines of least resistance by maintaining higher heterozygosity with alleles that are rare in the other ground finches  These alleles are associated with longer  narrower beaks within populations  which establishes a common mechanism between natural selection and species divergence  Comparative landscape genomics offers considerable power to provide insight into longstanding questions of evolution where natural selection acts in parallel across the landscape  
 TESTING THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS ON GENOMIC RECOMBINATION IN THE HONEY BEE  APIS MELLIFERA   It has become increasingly evident that genomic recombination is an evolved trait that varies between and within species  The honey bee has an extremely high genomic recombination rate but the responsible mechanisms have not been studied  Based on the hypothesis that meiotic recombination and DNA damage repair share common mechanisms in honey bees  we predict that oxidative stress leads to a further increase in recombination rate  This prediction can be directly tested by subjecting honey bee queens to oxidative stress by paraquat injection and measuring the rates of genomic recombination in select genome intervals of their offspring before and after injection  We report on the outcomes of this experiment and will discuss the results  implications for the understanding of the evolution of excessive recombination rates  as shown in honey bees  
Determination of complete mitochondrial genome sequences of cartilaginous fishes using next generation sequencing  Cartilaginous fishes  chondrichthyes  include sharks  skates  rays  and chimaeras  Currently  there are around 1300 extant species of cartilaginous fishes  The mitochondrial genome is a commonly used molecular marker for the studying of systematics and population genetics of these fishes  However  to sequence whole mitogenome sequences for all chondrichthyans using traditional methods is expensive  time consuming  and sometimes not feasible  e g  for dried museum specimens  In this study  over 100 mitogenomes of cartilaginous fishes were sequenced using short PCR based Sanger sequencing or long PCR based next generation sequencing methods  These sequences plus mitogenome sequences downloaded from the GenBank will be used to design RNA baits  These baits will then be employed to capture mitogenome sequences for more chondrichthyes  We expected to use this method to obtain whole mitogenome sequences for all chondrichthyan species we can get  These data will contribute significantly to the reconstruction of the Chondrichtyan Tree of Life  Studies on population genetics of chondrichthyes using mitogenomes will also be greatly facilitated  
Explaining the novel axes of adaptive phenotypic diversification in complex societies using the turtle ants  How the process of adaptive radiation unfolds in taxa that live in complex societies has received little attention  despite the tremendous diversity and ecological dominance of many of these lineages  In complex societies  like those of ants and other social insects  the colony is the adaptive unit  with its members functionally dependent on each other  The major evolutionary transition to complex social living introduces a number of novel axes of phenotypic diversification that do not exist in lineages of solitary or weakly social animals  Among the most striking is the differentiation of colony members into different specialized morphotypes  or   castes    that serve as different traits of the functionally integrated colony  Here  we analyze the evolution of a specialized soldier morphotype within the turtle ants  Cephalotes   a diverse lineage of arboreal ants that has radiated throughout the Neotropics  Turtle ant soldiers have heavily armored heads  which they use to block the entrances of the colonys arboreal nesting cavities  Consequently  we also examine the ecological correlates of soldier evolution  focusing on cavity properties known to interact with soldier cavity defense  Our analyses of soldier morphology emphasize the evolutionary transitions among distinct soldier morphotypes and the evolution of soldier head size  Our results show a degree of lability in soldier evolution that is unexpected based on classical predictions for caste evolution  Furthermore  we show that soldier morphology is significantly correlated with the properties of the cavities that each species chooses to inhabit  Overall  these analyses suggest that soldier evolution is a major axis of adaptive morphological diversification in the turtle ant radiation  shaped by the evolution of cavity selection  Historically  work on the ecology of caste evolution has been isolated from mainstream work on the ecology of adaptive radiation  Broadly  these analyses show the value of adopting modern phylogenetic comparative approaches to address caste evolution within a framework of adaptive radiation in complex societies  
Polymorphism Aware Phylogenetic Model  PoMo   An allele frequency based approach for species tree estimation  Incomplete lineage sorting  ILS  causes incongruences in the phylogenetic tree relative to different genes  If these incongruences are not accounted for  it is possible to incur several biases in species tree estimation  Here  we present a maximum likelihood approach that accounts for ancestral variation and ILS  We use a POlymorphisms aware phylogenetic MOdel  PoMo  that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between species variation data   De Maio et al   2013   PoMo is a phylogenetic Markov model with states that represent fixed alleles and states representing polymorphic alleles at different frequencies  A substitution is thus modeled from mutation  through the transient polymorphic stage  and to fixation  or loss   Polymorphic states can be observed in the tips of the phylogeny as well as at ancestral nodes  We extend this model for species trees estimation  We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of ILS using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed    In contrast to other approaches  our model has very few parameters  and in particular does not suffer from over parametrization   We show that PoMo is well suited for genome wide species tree estimation and that it is faster and more accurate than previous approaches   In our first analyses  a simple Nearest Neighbor Interchange algorithm  NNI  has been combined with PoMo  Currently  we implement our model into an efficient and easy to use software package IQ TREE  Minh et al   2013   It offers a very fast bootstrap technique that promises an additional  significant reduction of run time   We applied PoMo with species tree inference to data of a recent study on the genetic diversity and population history of the great apes  Prado Martinez et al   2013   This dataset includes all six great ape species with seven subspecies divided into a total number of 12 populations  with up to 23 individuals per population   The great apes constitute one of the most prominent examples for ILS  Using PoMo  we inferred the topology and branch lengths showing that our approach is accurate and that it can cope with data from many populations with many individuals each  Previous approaches based on coalescent theory can neither be applied genome wide nor on 12 populations  whereas our analysis runs for about 25 hours on a personal computer  We expect that with the new implementation in IQ TREE we can infer species trees for 20 to 100 populations opening  new applications  
Massive horizontal gene transfer of a chimeric photoreceptor in ferns  Ferns are well known for their shade dwelling habits  Their ability to thrive under such low light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a novel chimeric photoreceptor  neochrome  which fuses red sensing phytochrome and blue sensing phototropin modules into a single gene  thereby optimizing phototropic responses  Despite its potential importance in conferring a distinct evolutionary advantage to ferns living under dense canopies  the origin of neochrome has remained a mystery  We recently traced the origin of neochrome to hornworts  and showed that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via horizontal gene transfer  HGT   Subsequent phylogenetic analyses further revealed a large scale discordance   between the fern neochrome gene tree and the fern species tree  suggesting additional HGT occurred among ferns  Here we present new genomic evidence supporting that fern to fern neochrome HGT is present and likely rampant  Our finding not only provides the first evidence that a plant to plant HGT can have a profound evolutionary impact  but also has implications for the evolution of photosensory systems in plants  
Genomic signatures of selection in a classic fisheries harvest experiment  By imposing high levels of mortality on particular size and age groups  intense fishing can cause rapid evolution  Overwhelming evidence suggests that fishing has driven widespread changes in life history traits such as growth rate and timing of maturation across the world s fish populations  In many cases  the changes appear to be at least partially genetic  making fishing one of the most pervasive  human caused evolutionary impacts in the sea  Yet  so far almost nothing is known about the underlying genomic basis for these common changes in fish stocks  what types of genetic variation does fisheries selection act on  how extensively does it impact the genome through direct and hitchhiking effects  and how reversible are the changes once fishing stops  To address these questions  we have returned to a seminal experiment that demonstrated substantial evolution in growth rates and a suite of correlated traits in response to size selective fishing over just five generations in the Atlantic silverside  Menidia menidia   With RAD tag sequencing of archived samples from the original experiment  we have begun to characterize the genomic response underlying the observed phenotypic divergence between selected lines  e g  a nearly two fold difference in adult size   A scan of 39 351 SNPs distributed genome wide indicate that selection has caused large allele frequency differences at hundreds of unlinked loci and that in most cases  the genetic changes are highly localized to single SNPs  with limited hitchhiking effects  These widespread signatures of soft rather than hard sweeps indicate selection primarily on ancient polymorphisms at high frequency in the original source population rather than on a few new or initially rare mutations  In addition to shedding light on how fisheries induced selection operates  the study therefore also contributes to our general understanding of selection on standing genetic variation in large highly polymorphic populations  
Direct and correlated responses to artificial selection for herbicide resistance in Ipomoea purpurea  Divergence in traits and the transcriptome  Human mediated selection can lead to rapid evolution in very short time scales  and the evolution of herbicide resistance in agricultural weeds is an excellent example of this phenomenon  An enduring question about this process is whether or not intense selection for increased resistance can lead to correlated changes in other traits that may have important consequences for organismal fitness  Here we assess this question at the level of the phenotype and the plant transcriptome in the agricultural weed Ipomoea purpurea using the tools of artificial selection and RNA seq  We examined the evolutionary response to direct artificial selection for increased and decreased resistance to the herbicide glyphosate and the potential that plant size and growth traits respond via indirect selection  We then assessed gene expression at the level of the transcriptome to determine if selection on resistance leads to divergent responses in transcribed genes  We found rapid responses to artificial selection lines selected for increased resistance over two generations exhibited less plant damage and a lower proportion of individuals that died post spray compared to control and susceptible lines  We also found that resistant lines exhibited fewer leaves pre herbicide than both control and susceptible lines  indicating a trade off between plant size and resistance status  In addition to phenotypic divergence among selection lines  we also found differences in gene expression  Nineteen genes were differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible lines  one of which is a cytochrome P450 gene that belongs to a large plant family of genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification  Our work suggests that selection for divergence in herbicide resistance can lead to both the evolution of the phenotype and differential gene expression of the transcriptome  and that such divergence can lead to potential allocation costs  
Context dependent effects of sampling design and demographic history on genome scans for local adaptation  Genome scans based on landscape SNP data are a popular way to uncover the genetic basis of adaptive variation to heterogeneous environments   In this study  we compare various types of genetic environment associations  GEAs  with Fst outlier tests in four demographic histories   island model  isolation by distance  range expansion from one refugium  and range expansion from two refugia   In addition  we explore how sampling design on the landscape  random  paired samples  or transects  affects the relative power of each statistic   Our results clearly show that GEAs are more powerful that Fst for the island model  and that Fst is more powerful than GEAs for isolation by distance   Both types of tests had moderate power for the range expansion scenarios   We also found subtle differences in power among statistics that depended on how many individuals were sampled from the landscape   In most cases  paired samples had the highest power to detect loci that were locally adapted   Our results were based on empirical p values  because we found that p values from the programs were not reliable   We advocate for using a set of putatively neutral loci to create empirical p values  
Fishery induced selection  what can be learned from introduced salmonids in Sierra Nevada Lakes   Size selective fishing is expected to trigger evolutionary responses but the potential for fishery induced selection to significantly modify population characteristics is controversial and not yet well understood  More research is needed to understand how and when size selective fishing alters traits and dynamics in harvested populations  In this study  we analyzed data from over 30 populations of non native brook trout  Salvelinus fontinalis  and rainbow trout  Oncorhynchus mykiss  that were completely removed from lakes in California s Sierra Nevada during the course of a habitat restoration program  In total  over 45 000 fish were harvested via gill nets and electro fishing  and length at capture and time at capture were recorded for nearly every fish  We used these data to estimate fishery selection on body length in replicate populations  and to relate the strength of fishery selection to population  and habitat specific characteristics  Even though  non  selective fishing gear   e g  variable mesh size gill nets  was used in removal efforts  we found that fishing was more likely to remove larger individuals  Due to this size selectivity  we observed a dramatic decline in the mean and variability of fish length within a few months across populations  The magnitude of this decrease may be linked to population specific parameters  such as initial size distribution  which could be in turn be driven by local environmental factors  e g  lake size  elevation   Our study demonstrates that size selective fishing not only affects population structure by removing the largest individuals  but also that the environment can mediate the impact of fishing  These findings highlight how fishery induced selection may influence harvested populations and may help inform population specific management or conservation plans  
Resurrecting Experimental Phylogenetics  The Age of Digital Evolution  Accurate inference of historical relationships  i e  phylogenetics  is central to evolutionary biology  Our ability to infer phylogenies has consistently improved through theoretic advancements in molecular evolution and the implementation of sophisticated computational tools  Current approaches for testing phylogenetic methods rely almost exclusively on computational simulations  which are superb tools for analyses of large amounts of simulated data under defined parameter values  Simulations are less useful tools for the analyses of complex interactions among factors and they cannot be used to evaluate emergent or unknown properties present in complex systems  Thus  our perception of phylogenetic accuracy is constrained to inferences that can be gleaned using simulations stipulated under simple evolutionary models  as opposed to empirically evolving organisms  Alternative but rarely used approaches to evaluate the accuracy of phylogenetic inference are analyses of data from natural or experimental populations with a known evolutionary history  The drawbacks to these techniques are their labor  and time intensiveness in observing evolutionary change  The digital software platform Avida is a highly manageable yet freely evolving system that allows quick replicate experimentation  which facilitates experimental validation of phylogenetic methods  Using digital experimental evolution  we examined the effects of natural selection  recombination  and the extent of lineage evolution on phylogenetic accuracy  Tree topologies were symmetrical eight taxon trees rooted with an outgroup  comparable to those from a landmark study of experimental phylogenetics  We show that under most experimental conditions both maximum likelihood  and Bayesian inference based methods maintained a high degree of accuracy in the presence of natural selection  recombination  or differing branch lengths  However  when populations were evolved under multiple such conditions  clade accuracy diminished due to complex synergistic interactions  Visualizing representations of  tree space   the entire set of 135 135 tree topologies  for these experiments allowed us to determine that the single best tree identified was indeed the most likely  though not correct  evolutionary history  We will focus our discussion to select case studies in order to highlight the worth of digital evolution  and for that matter experimental evolution  as complementary tools in phylogenetics  
Transposable element and genome size evolution in sexual and functionally asexual evening primroses  Genome size varies more than 1200 fold across the flowering plants  Despite plenty of theoretical and empirical attention  little consensus exists on the main factors underlying this variation  Several studies have demonstrated that a major contributor to genome size difference between closely related species is differential accumulation of transposable elements  Furthermore  there appears to be a strong correlation between the proportion of the genome made up of transposons and genome size in plants  Given the key role of transposon abundance in driving genome size variation  transposon dynamics should be central to attempts to understand genome size evolution  Much population genetic theory predicts that the reproductive system of the host organism will be an important factor in transposon dynamics  However  whether sexual reproduction should be associated with an increase or decrease in transposon copy number remains unclear  On the one hand  asexuality may lead to a decrease because insertions cannot spread to new lineages through syngamy  On the other hand  Mueller s ratchet like processes may result in higher transposon accumulation in asexual lineages  Here  we use a combination of transcriptome sequencing and flow cytometry to compare transposon activity and genome size evolution in some thirty species of differing reproductive systems in the plant genus Oenothera  the evening primroses  Functional asexuality  the absence of recombination and segregation  is estimated to have evolved independently approximately 20 times in the genus  Moreover  in contrast with many other asexual species  functionally asexual species tend to share the same ploidy level with their sexual relatives The effect of reproductive system is therefore decoupled from the effect of ploidy level  which is also expected to affect transposon evolution  making Oenothera particularly suitable for this kind of comparative analyses   
Thermal reactionome of the temperate forest ants Aphaenogaster rudis and A  picea  Temperature plays a prominent role in structuring biological diversity from molecular to macroecological scales  While thermal reaction norms at the level of organismal phenotype have been characterized in hundreds of insect species  little is known about how these are manifested at the level of genes underlying thermal tolerance  or how gene expression profiles respond evolutionarily to environmentally mediated selection  To characterize global gene expression in response to thermal stress  the   thermal reactionome     we performed RNAseq analysis using a novel response surface sampling design at 3 5¡C temperature intervals across a 40¡C temperature range in two closely related eastern North American ant species  Aphaenogaster rudis and A  picea  which have more southern and northern distributions  respectively  We identified over 8 000 transcripts   8  of the total  that were thermally responsive in the two species  Candidate genes such as heat shock protein 90  heat shock protein 20 and heat shock protein 30 were upregulated at high temperatures  Gene set enrichment analysis found six gene ontology  GO  terms that were enriched at high temperatures including  gene expression  and  regeneration   60 GO terms were enriched at low temperatures including 16  metabolic process  terms  11 GO terms were enriched at intermediate temperatures including 6 terms involved in lipid biosynthetic or metabolic processes  Overall comparisons of the thermal reactionomes between the two species revealed that about 90  of the differences were due to changes in the slope and curvature  rather than the means  for the reaction norms of gene expression  Many of the responsive genes would have been missed if a reaction norm approach had not been used  While both species activated about the same number of genes in response to heat stress  the northern species A  picea activated about 36  more genes in response to cold temperatures than A  rudis  In addition  both species activated 3 4x more genes in response to cold then warm temperatures  Together  these results suggest there is a genetic basis to the observation from phenotypic studies that critical maximum temperatures are less variable than critical minimum temperatures in Aphaenogaster and other ecototherms  A key implication of this conclusion is that temperate ant species may have a constrained potential to acclimate and adapt to global warming   
Some  do not  Like It Hot  The Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor in Heat Stressed Corals                Corals are complex  beautiful animals that harbor symbiotic algae  Sometimes called    the rainforests of the ocean    they provide shelter and food for other ocean organisms  They are however  in danger due climate change  and little is known about how they can adapt and deal with these changes  The tumor necrosis factor receptor  TNFR  may act as a molecular switch and help determine how corals react to environmental stress  including heat stress  The  front loading  of TNFR expression in corals that have historically been exposed to stressful environmental conditions could be indicative of resilience in corals  TNFR has the potential to be a  coral health biomarker   There is a subset of genes with expression values that are correlated with the expression of TNFR in corals  We hypothesize that the function of these genes with TNFRs in corals is involved in many important cellular processes  including immunity  apoptosis and combating environmental stress  I am currently testing the role of different TNFR genes in response to heat stress in the coral Acropora hyacinthus from American Samoa in order to understand how the gene expression of TNFR reacts to changes in the environment  The novel role of TNFR as a heat induced switch could broaden our understanding of the evolutionary role of this gene  
Quantitative circadian phenotypes vary over the growing season and determine fitness  Circadian clocks are common in all three domains of life  suggesting that internal mechanisms of time keeping are adaptive  Consistent with adaptive hypotheses  the circadian clock exhibits pervasive transcriptomic and phenotypic effects in controlled settings  Functional allelic variation at clock loci likewise suggests the potential for ongoing adaptive evolution of the circadian clock in response to selection  However  the fitness consequences of either a functional vs  non functional clock or quantitative clock variation remain largely unresolved in nature  and quantitative genetic parameters that determine the potential for evolutionary responses of the clock remain likewise uncharacterized in ecologically relevant settings  In field studies  we show that disruption of clock function via mutation reduces both survival and fecundity  while subtler adjustments via genomic introgression of naturally occurring alleles indicate that clock cycles 24 hrs in diverse species  The results also translate functional analyses of clock behavior performed in controlled settings to natural ones  demonstrating that in segregating populations circadian phase is both highly responsive to diverse seasonally variable abiotic inputs and showing that the circadian clock may undergo adaptive evolution  
Abnormal Gene Expression and Parent of Origin Growth Effects  Mammalian hybrids often show abnormal growth  indicating that developmental inviability may play an important role in mammalian speciation  In reciprocal crosses between two dwarf hamsters Phodopus campbelli and P  sungorus  extreme parent of origin dependent growth is manifest in hybrid embryos and placentas  It has been hypothesized that disrupted genomic imprinting may result in such characteristic patterns of parent of origin dependent hybrid growth  but the generality of this prediction has not been established  Here we test for transcriptome wide patterns of differential expression and disrupted genomic imprinting in F1 hybrids of dwarf hamsters to determine if changes in expression are correlated with parent of origin growth in these animals  Among genes that are differentially expressed between large and normal sized F1 hybrids we find an over representation of genes involved in fetal growth  Specifically  genes whose function is correlated with increased growth show higher levels of expression in large compared to regular sized hybrids   
Shifting lines in the sand  determinants of spatiotemporally dynamic opportunities for sexual selection in a polygynous mammal  Opportunities for sexual selection in animal populations involve sex ratio  competition for limited resources and mates  and the presence of non mating males  Although these factors can vary spatially and temporally within a population  we know little about how this variability may manifest itself in opportunities for selection  We quantified spatially explicit local densities  adult sex ratios  opportunities for selection associated with harem and mate acquisition  and harem dispersion among males over 5 breeding seasons in a 300 year old feral horse population on Sable Island  Canada  Density and distance from a limiting resource  freshwater  showed pronounced interactive effects with weather  drought conditions  in determining spatiotemporal variability in sex ratios  and effects of non mating males were also evident  Density of non mating males explained much of the spatial variability in the opportunity for selection associated with acquiring a harem beyond that explained by sex ratio  whereas distance from water best explained mate acquisition  Distance from water also contributed substantially to harem dispersion  and interacted with drought conditions to drive a spatiotemporally shifting boundary of under dispersion in harems  i e   opportunities for male selection  across the island  Understanding how sex ratio and opportunity for selection vary spatially according to environmental conditions and in accordance with inter annual weather is critical for predicting how sexual selection may respond to changes in resource availability and climate change  
Parallel MCMC and Inference of Ancient Demography under the Isolation with Migration  IM  Model  The Isolation with Migration  IM  model has been utilized extensively for the inference of ancestral demography using putatively neutral genomic data  Among the parameters inferred under this model  are pair wise migration rates  effective population sizes  and divergence times  The most widely used framework employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo  MCMC  based sampling of genealogies  Nielsen and Wakeley 2001    However such MCMC based genealogy samplers suffer some from a state space that grows super exponentially with the size of the data  i e  # of individuals and # of loci  and from a slow approach to stationarity for larger data sets  i e  poor mixing   For example the IMa2 program   Hey and Nielsen 2007  Hey 2010   is difficult to use for large numbers of loci because of these issues   We addressed these problems by extending the current code using a parallel algorithm for MCMC  following Altekar et al  2004   The parallel version of IMa2 is capable of running multiple chains on each processor or node  and Metropolis coupling between independent MCMC spaces is invoked by swapping temperatures of chains  also known as  MC 3  We implement both the global and point to point exchange schemes as proposed by Altekar et al  2004   and explore efficiency and speed of the algorithm with a large data set from human hunter gatherer populations  Parallel IMa2 is written in C++  with OpenMPI  and both serial and parallel versions of the software  and source code will be made available through the Hey Lab website  https   bio cst temple edu  hey software software htm   
 Forest vs  trees  does it matter whether the MATE measures student acceptance of  rather than understanding about  evolutionary theory    The tool most often used to determine whether students accept the explanatory power of the Theory of Evolution is the 20 question Likert scale Measures of the Acceptance of Evolutionary Theory  or MATE   This survey has recently been criticized  in part because it may not be a valid assessment for all populations  but more centrally because it may measure how well students understand the theory of evolution  rather than accepting it as the best explanation for the diversity of life   Numerous studies  including our own  have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of general education science courses at improving student critical thinking  CT  skills in general  and their understanding of basic explanatory theories in the sciences  including evolution  in particular   We have previously reported how a novel experimental approach to teaching a gen ed science course can help students improve their CT skills while also demonstrating improved scores on the MATE   We here update those results   Specifically  we show that it simply does not matter how many gen ed science courses a student takes in terms of their performance on the MATE   That is  students who have completed a one  two  three  or four  typical  gen ed science courses show absolutely no improvement in their MATE scores  underscoring a pedagogical weakness of such courses    A class designed  however  to help students understand the Nature of Science leads to significant improvements in both their CT skills and their performance on the MATE   We argue that such improvements are the forest  while arguing about the semantics of  acceptance  vs   understanding  are the trees  if we hope to generate a cohort of scientifically literate college graduates  citizens who will fight to prevent the teaching of pseudoscientific nonsense in their public schools  it would be unfortunate if we abandon the MATE because it measures changes in understanding rather than in attitude   
Divergent phenotypes despite  mostly  homogeneous genomes  insights from a recent avian radiation  In diverging species  reproductive isolation may initially be achieved at key loci involved in generating speciation phenotypes  with differentiation extending throughout the genome only with substantial time  Recent radiations  such as that of seedeaters in the avian genus Sporophila  provide an opportunity to explore the genetics of the early stages of speciation  These eight species have extremely low neutral genetic differentiation and lack of species level monophyly  which we interpret as the consequence of recent common ancestry and ongoing hybridization and introgression  These species are predominantly sympatric and differ mainly in adult male vocalizations and coloration patterns  suggesting an important role for sexual selection in driving their differentiation  We used a reduced representation genomic approach  restriction site associated DNA tag sequencing  to sample and compare single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  from their genomes  We assess levels of divergence across Å75k unlinked markers using tree based methods  summary statistics and Bayesian assignment tests  Consistent with previous findings  the species show low overall genetic divergence  with FST generally ST outliers and showed signals of divergent selection  Some such SNPs were outliers consistently across independent contrasts involving different species pairs  Highly diverged loci were mapped onto the Zebra Finch genome to obtain a putative chromosomal location and function  Our findings suggest that the genomes of these phenotypically diverse incipient species are mosaics of evolutionary histories  with different loci exhibiting varying degrees of divergence  
 Evolution of the a troglobitic salamander  Eurycea spelaea   The biology of many cave dwelling organisms  troglobites  is poorly known due to their cryptic lifestyles and inaccessible habitat  Low dispersal and high habitat fragmentation has led to significant phylogeographic structure in several widespread subterranean organisms  However  an insufficient amount of phylogeographic studies of troglobites exist  This is of particular importance given the potential for unrecognized cryptic species within troglobitic taxa  The Grotto Salamander  Eurycea spelaea   endemic to the Ozark Plateau  is confined to life in caves during its adult life  Currently there is only one recognized species of Grotto Salamander  but recent work has revealed high levels of genetic diversity and indications of cryptic speciation  In this study  we further investigate the fine scale genetic diversity and geographic structure within E  spelaea   Mitochondrial DNA shows evidence of three highly divergent lineages across the Ozarks  We employed next generation sequencing techniques to compare nuclear genes to mitochondrial divergence and test if these patterns are correlated with geologic and hydrologic features of the Ozark Plateau  In order to better understand the pressures directing the evolution of cave dwelling vertebrates  we compared the phylogeographic structure in E  spelaea with other troglobitic salamanders  
Experimental evolution of reduced antagonism  a role for host parasite  Symbiotic relationships vary in nature from parasitism to mutualism  with shifts in degrees of antagonism occurring readily  even between populations of the same symbiont species  Ecological factors driving these shifts have been the subject of recent studies  which have demonstrated a need for further investigation of the genetic and evolutionary processes at play in the variation underlying symbioses  In the present study  we selected for reduced antagonism between the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its virulent bacteria Serratia marcescens  Infection by S  marcescens typically results in rapid mortality of C  elegans  We selected for a rare infection phenotype in which hosts survive and reproduce while hosting bacteria that are neither cleared nor lethal to the host  Our passaging scheme allowed the evolution of reduced antagonism to be compared under conditions of reciprocal symbiont evolution  coevolution  vs  independent evolution of both symbionts  in which selection on one partner was performed with a non evolving partner population  Quantification of infected host fecundity after 20 generations of selection demonstrates that reduced antagonism between host and bacteria did evolve  This was true  however  only for symbionts selected under conditions permitting coevolution  Selection on either partner alone  with a non evolving partner population  did not increase fitness of infected hosts relative to the ancestor  Our results implicate coevolution  in which interacting partners reciprocally evolve  as a key process driving reductions in antagonism between hosts and parasites   
Evolutionary responses of plants to urban environments  Urban environments are hotter  drier  and have altered air quality than their rural surroundings  and therefore provide a natural experiment to examine evolutionary responses to new habitats  Using seeds collected from Minneapolis and St  Paul and neighboring rural areas we conducted greenhouse and reciprocal transplant experiments  We detected phenotypic differences between urban and rural plants  with plants from rural sources reproducing later but plants from urban sources growing larger  In the field  urban plants were larger in the urban environment and rural plants were larger in the rural environment  consistent with local adaptation  Analyses examining selection and fitness differences are currently underway  Understanding if and how plant populations have adapted to urban environments may provide insight into niche expansions as well as plant responses to future climates  which are expected to be characterized by shifts in abiotic factors similar to those in urban environments   
Spider Transcriptomes Identify Ancient Large Scale Gene Duplication Event and its Role in Silk Gland Evolution  Spiders  Order Araneae  evolved silk production more than 392 million years ago  Since that time the silk producing glands have diversified into numerous morphologically distinct types that each produce task specific fibers composed of unique proteins that derive from a single gene family  Large scale gene duplication events are thought to contribute to the evolution of such novel tissues and functional diversity  While a large scale duplication event has been hypothesized to have occurred within spiders  its age and influence on the evolution on the silk glands is not known  Using high throughput sequencing of RNAs expressed in 12 tissues of three cobweb weaving spider species  we de novo assembled transcriptomes and identified numerous paralog pairs of similar age  supporting an ancient Large Scale Spider Duplication event  LSSD   We compared these paralogous transcripts to orthologs from previously published partial transcriptomes from seven other spider species  and estimated the age of duplication events relative to spider speciation events  The distribution of the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  dS  for duplication events was similar to the distribution of dS for the divergence of the two spider suborders  Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae   300 mya   Transcripts expressed exclusively  or at significantly higher levels than other tissues  within the silk glands were more likely to have a paralog dating to the ancient duplication event compared to generally expressed transcripts  Additionally the silk specific transcripts show elevated amino acid replacement rates compared to generally expressed transcripts  in part due to relaxed selection on paralog pairs relative to single copy genes  However  the elevated amino acid replacement rates in silk specific transcripts compared to their generally expressed counterparts does subsist even when correcting for gene family size  We propose that the LSSD post dates the origin of silk glands in spiders  but contributed to the diversification of silk glands through the co option of multiple genes for silk gland specific expression  
Testing the role of ecology and life history in structuring genetic variation across a landscape  A comparative ecophylogeographic approach  Hypotheses to explain phylogeographic structure traditionally invoke geographic features  but often fail to provide a general explanation for spatial patterns of genetic variation  An organism s intrinsic characteristics might play more important roles than landscape features in determining phylogeographic structure  We developed a novel comparative approach to explore the role of ecological and life history variables in determining spatial genetic variation and tested it on frog communities in Panama  We quantified spatial genetic variation within 31 anuran species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences  for which hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation analyses rejected simultaneous divergence over a common landscape  Regressing ecological variables on genetic divergence revealed that body size  current landscape resistance  geographic range  biogeographic origin  and reproductive mode were significant predictors of spatial genetic variation  Our results support the idea that phylogeographic structure represents the outcome of an interaction between organisms and environment  and suggest a conceptual integration we refer to as ecophylogeography   
Gut microbiome diversity across cichlid fish in Lake Tanganika  Intestinal microbes play an essential role in their hosts  digestion  development  immune system and overall fitness  Though gut bacterial communities are known to vary widely among vertebrates  the relative influences of evolutionary lineage  surrounding environment  and diet of the host are poorly understood  In this study  we examine these factors in shaping the gut bacteria across cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika  East Africa using Illumina amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA  First  we surveyed the gut bacteria of 26 cichlid species and 6 non cichlid species representing diverse trophic ecologies  algivory  piscivory  invertivory  omnivory  zooplanktivory  scale ripping  collected from a single site  Preliminary results suggest that both phylogeny and diet play a role in shaping gut bacterial communities  In the second part of our study  we analyzed two algivorous cichlids that differ in feeding strategy and trophic morphology  including one grazer scraper  Petrochromis sp   kazumbe   and one browser  Tropheus brichardi  collected from eight discrete sites  Gut microbial communities differed somewhat consistently between these species  but there were also strong differences within species according to geographic location  In particular  the gut bacterial community of Petrochromis sp   kazumbe  appears to show distinct geographic structure relative to a large embayment separating groups of sites  Overall  our analyses indicate that gut bacterial communities in Tanganyikan fish are shaped by the trophic ecology of their hosts as well as phylogenetic and biogeographic influences  This study provides new insights into understanding the mode and tempo of gut microbiota shifts across ecologic  phylogenetic and geographic distances  
Evolutionary genetics of pigmentation variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster  Research on insect melanism has been informative in understanding how evolutionary mechanisms can produce phenotypic diversity   My work examines how genes participating in the pigment biosynthesis pathway may be contributing to natural variation of pigmentation traits in Drosophila melanogaster   I uncovered significant variation in abdominal and thoracic pigmentation both within and among populations of D  melanogaster in the eastern United States    I closely examined how polymorphisms within the pigmentation genes  ebony  pale  ddc  and tan are associated with pigmentation traits   I also looked for patterns of nucleotide diversity in each gene as well as evidence for selection   Each of the genes had loci that were significantly associated with pigmentation  with some being in regions that may be experiencing possible balancing or purifying selection   Adult expression of ebony and pale were also significantly correlated with pigmentation levels   These results suggest that various components in the pigmentation pathway are evolving together in order to produce phenotypic variation in these populations   Additionally  there was evidence for independent regulation of pigmentation expression in the thorax and the abdomen   Analysis of pigmentation phenotypes has revealed significant geographic patterns with a possible cline in thoracic traits   We also sequenced a group of alleles of the ebony and pale genes in these populations to examine clinal patterns and confirm associations with pigmentation traits   My work has the potential to increase the understanding of how polymorphisms at the nucleotide sequence level contribute to population level differences and possibly adaptation in D  melanogaster and other insect species    
 Optimal sampling of plant populations for ex situ conservation of genetic biodiversity  considering realistic population structure   Ex situ conservation collections  e g  seed banks or botanic gardens  require high diversity to enable future reintroduced populations to adapt  but are limited in size due to financial constraints  Keeping in mind the goal of maximizing diversity while minimizing collection size  collectors must decide how many samples to collect  and from which populations  Population genetic structure  i e  subdivision   which is common in plants  may be an important consideration for such collections because it results in locally restricted alleles or traits  which have high conservation value  Population structure also means that other alleles are redundant  i e  present in more than one population  increasing their chance of being sampled  It has been previously suggested  in general terms  that when a species is subdivided and or has a large range  samples should be taken from across the range  but the relative advantage of such spatially distributed sampling has not been quantified in any study  To fill this knowledge gap  we utilized computer simulations to evaluate the expected performance of an array of sample sizes and several spatial distributions of sampled populations under different levels of realistic hierarchical population structure  Specifically  we quantified how population structure affects the expected probability of capturing different categories of alleles  especially rare alleles   Our findings suggest that when range wide population structure exists  the spatial distribution of sampled populations is crucial  sampling one population per region captured up to 175  more alleles than sampling all populations in one region  and sometimes nearly as much as sampling all existing populations  The spatial effect is strongest for poorly connected  low gene flow  species  and for particular allelic categories  Under realistic population structure  moderate sampling  25 30  from few but widely spaced populations performs well  which differs from previous recommended sampling sizes that do not consider structure  Results are consistent for biallelic  SNP  and hypervariable  microsatellite  markers  and for simulated medium and large geographic ranges  Our results demonstrate that spatial considerations are crucial aspect when establishing an ex situ collection  especially in poorly connected plant species  Our simulation approach can be extended to particular species and other spatial patterns such as clines  We use the widely distributed tree butternut  Juglans cinerea L  as a case study for planning a sampling strategy  
Neotenous feather replacement facilitates loss of flight in birds  The ability to fly was a key adaptation for the evolution of modern birds and has allowed birds to radiate into a diverse array of habitats and evolve novel life history strategies  However  maintaining the ability to fly is physiologically costly because of the energy required to maintain structures such as an extremely enlarged pectoralis muscle  Because of this  flight has been evolutionarily lost many times and in many groups of birds  The ancestral bird to crown Aves was likely volant  and so all extant flightless birds have lost flight  Some of the most charismatic flightless birds  such as ostriches or penguins  have lost flight deep in the past and have evolved life history strategies that do not involve flight  Conversely  some groups  such as rails and ducks  have rapidly evolved a flightless lifestyle many times in the recent past   A common character shared by groups that have shown prolific recent losses of flight is that volant species in these families molt all their remiges simultaneously as adults  while most other groups of birds molt feathers simultaneously only as juveniles and sequentially as adults to maintain flight ability during the molt   Otherwise volant species that molt their remiges simultaneously are thus left flightless during the molting period  I hypothesize that these lineages lose flight quickly and commonly because of preadaptions to a non volant lifestyle facilitated by the ability to escape predators and forage for resources without the ability to fly   I suggest that simultaneous molt in adults birds is best viewed as a neotenous character  and that molt strategies should be examined within the context of heterochrony  Neoteny has been implicated as a facilitator of rapid morphological and ecological evolution in other groups because change in developmental timing can result in profound life history alteration with relatively few physiological and morphological changes  I used a Bayesian approach to test the hypothesis that simultaneous molt has facilitated loss of flight in birds  by implementing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method over a pseudo posterior distribution of super trees of all birds to test whether a model in which the loss of flight is dependent upon simultaneous molt is more likely than a model of independent evolution  Preliminary analyses support a model of dependent evolution  in which a simultaneous molt strategy facilitates loss of flight  
Comparative analyses of biomechanical reproductive traits in harvestmen support intersexual coevolution via simultaneous mechanisms  Reproductive traits have a long history as taxonomic characters  but their precise functions and the combination of evolutionary processes underlying their diversification are not well understood  Most researchers attribute diversity in reproductive structures to either sexual selection by female choice  intersexual conflict or to some poorly defined synthesis of the two  In order to assess the presence or absence of simultaneous effects of choice and conflict  we analyzed biomechanically inspired variables from both sexes of 29 harvestman species using phylogeny based comparative approaches  Our results corroborated the hypothesis that female choice and intersexual conflict can operate simultaneously at differing intensities to generate a continuous spectrum of forms  Canonical correlation analysis of male and female traits revealed a strong relationship consistent with sexual coevolution in precopulatory structures  Species with pregenital barriers specialized for intersexual conflict dominated one end of the spectrum  those lacking such specializations  including those with gift bearing penile sacs  dominated the other  and there was a significant region of overlap  Similar results were obtained with principal components analysis  Furthermore  linear discriminant analysis could not reliably distinguish groups defined by the presence or absence of gift bearing penile sacs or groups defined by the presence or absence of female pregenital barriers  results that are inconsistent with the hypothesis that female choice and intersexual conflict act in a mutually exclusive manner  Our results suggest that the relative intensities of female choice and intersexual conflict that have shaped the reproductive mechanisms of individual species can be quantified  This ability will allow statistical comparisons with quantifiable ecological  life history or social variables and may ultimately reveal the arrangement of evolutionary factors that shape diversity in reproductive structures  
Linking phenotype to expression  A comparative approach to understanding the effects of mating system on immune system processes  A species  mating system has tremendous impacts on many critical aspects of an animal s life  In particular  variations in the number and extent of reproductive interactions are thought to correspond to variations in exposure to communicable diseases  To further understand the potential effects of mating system on an animal s exposure and biological response to pathogens  we investigated gene expression in two species of Peromyscine mice  Peromyscus maniculatus  the deer mouse  and P  californicus  the California mouse   These closely related congeners are highly sympatric and ecologically similar  but differ radically in social mating system  whereas P  maniculatus is highly promiscuous  the genetically monogamous P  californicus is characterized by exclusive  lifelong pair bonds  Previous comparative work on these species has demonstrated that  relative to the monogamous P  californicus  the promiscuous P  maniculatus has experienced enhanced selection on at least one immune gene and also maintains a greater bacterial diversity in the reproductive system  In accordance with the hypothesis that sexually promiscuous species are at a higher risk of contracting communicable diseases than their monogamous counterparts  we predicted that promiscuity would also correspond to greater expression of immune genes  To test this  we performed an RNA Seq experiment using spleen tissue obtained from 10 adult P  maniculatus and 11 adult P  californicus specimens that were live caught on a single trapline over a three day period  Illumina reads from individually indexed spleenic cDNA libraries were mapped to species specific transcriptomes assembled from liver and spleen mRNA  and annotated transcripts shared between both species were tested for evidence of differential expression using eXpress  Contrary to our predictions  gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that P  maniculatus expressed genes associated with many immunological processes at much lower levels than did P  californicus  However  this decrease in immune gene expression was generally limited to processes associated with adaptive immunity  in contrast  gene ontologies associated with the innate immune system were overrepresented among genes that were expressed in relatively higher levels in P  maniculatus samples  The differences in expression of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune processes observed between these two species may be driven by distinct pathogen pressures  as each species also demonstrated differential expression of genes related to tumor defense  bacterial proliferation  and viral replication  These findings highlight the importance of considering both adaptive and innate immune genes  as well as contemporaneous pathogen pressures  when using comparative frameworks to investigate the effects of mating system on immune processes  
Sample sequencing of 40 squamate reptile genomes reveals extensive evolutionary dynamics of genomic repeat element landscapes  More than 450 million years of vertebrate evolution has resulted in surprisingly low variation in gene number  despite tremendous variation in overall genome size  The genomic repeat landscape  however  exhibits a complex evolutionary history that is highly correlated with fluctuations in genome size  Furthermore  these non coding repeat elements are now known to play import roles in diverse genomic processes  including recombination  regulation of gene expression  and regional chromatin state  Recent sequencing of 32 Squamate genomes has revealed extensive variation in the genomic repeat element content of Squamate reptiles  This remarkable variation contradicts the accepted view that the greatest variation in genomic repeat content exists between major amniote clades  e g   between mammals and birds   and not within any one lineage  In this study  we expanded taxonomic sampling and gathered preliminary data on the genomic repeat landscape of Squamate reptiles  Our results indicate unprecedented divergence in repetitive content  structure  and abundance within a major amniote lineage  with certain Squamate species exhibiting a repeat content of  50   similar to mammals   while other species having a proportion of repeats less than 30   more similar to birds   Our results indicate that both transposable elements and simple sequence repeats  microsatellites  contribute significantly to repeat landscape variation among species  and further demonstrate that certain transposable elements previously identified to be associated with microsatellite expansion and venom gene duplication appear to be greatly expanded in venomous lineages of snakes  
Teaching teachers to teach evolution  An idiots guide  Recent polls indicate that less than half of the U S  population accepts evolution as scientific fact   Studies also indicate that teacher training in science and evolution can potentially increase teacher effectiveness in teaching evolution in the K 12 classroom   At the University of Illinois  we have implemented a 3 day summer teacher workshop in evolutionary biology   Our workshop has three main goals   Our first goal is to increase teacher knowledge and confidence in evolution   To do this  we discuss the book Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne as well as the Discovery Institutes response Why Darwinism is False by Jonathan Wells   The goal with these readings is to make teachers aware of the fallaciousness of the arguments posed against evolution   Our second goal is to equip teachers with activities that they can use in their classrooms   To achieve this goal  we do a number of activities with the teachers including the toilet paper timeline of evolution  the great clade race  the Guppy Game  and a BLAST activity using hemoglobin   Our third goal is to provide teachers with examples of current research in evolutionary biology   To do this  we employ a number of lunchtime speakers that present results from their ongoing research    While our teacher workshop is very successful in many ways  there are things that can be done to increase its effectiveness   In this talk  I will present results from teacher surveys relating to  a  the strengths and weaknesses of our workshop and  b  the extent to which our activities were implemented into the K 12 curriculum   I will also present results on what teachers want and what education experts tell us we need to do to increase the efficacy of our outreach efforts   
Demographic inference and genetic diversity in isolated urban and rural populations of white footed deermice in New York City  Urbanization is often characterized by extreme fragmentation of native habitats and is a likely driver for adaptation in the non model organism  Peromyscus leucopus  in New York City  NYC   The white footed deermouse is an abundant small mammal native to eastern North America and in NYC  is representative of an urban adapter   We examined genetic structure and the demographic history of white footed mice in NYC and looked for evidence of local adaptation in isolated urban populations   We utilized next generation sequencing  NGS  of restriction site associated DNA  RADseq  to generate thousands of putatively neutral RAD tags and assembled the nearly complete P  leucopus transcriptome from RNA sequencing   This dataset was generated from equal numbers of deermice in undisturbed protected rural habitat and several urban park sites  and population genetic statistics were calculated in protein coding regions  Demography is difficult to construct from historical records  but new techniques that utilize the joint allele frequency spectrum allow for demographic inference from genomic data   Using the RADseq loci we looked at genetic structure and estimated demographic parameters for populations of white footed deermice in and around NYC and then complimented this history with a scan for genetic diversity across transcriptome contigs containing RAD tags   We find evidence of selection in genes that might be driving local adaptation in NYC P  leucopus populations and uncover the demographic history of white footed deermice in a fragmented urban habitat  
 Evolutionary history and traits  not invasive status  influences community assembly   Determining community assembly mechanisms is a primary goal of ecologists  particularly in modern communities that have both native and introduced species and variable disturbance histories  Phylogenetic and trait based quantitative tools can unravel these patterns but have been used mostly at continental and regional scales  not at the local scale where limiting similarity might be more apparent  We compiled a phylogenetic  trait  and abundance database for 71 understory species  including 53 native and 18 introduced species  in 25 deciduous forest stands with known disturbance history  Environmental filtering of traits and phylogeny strongly dictated the occurrence and abundance of species  Importantly  these relationships were similar for both native and introduced species in the majority of forest stands  Thus  most differences between native and introduced species could be quantified in terms of phylogenetic and functional distance  and native introduced status per se was of relatively minor importance to predicting plant success  
 Fine scale analysis of a genome wide linkage map to examine meiotic recombination in the honey bee  Apis mellifera    The western honey bee  Apis mellifera  has an exceptionally high rate of genomic recombination  but the fine scale patterns that may allow a mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon are unclear  Specifically  the high overall recombination rate may be due to a higher background rate or due to more and or hotter hotspots  The red queen explanation of the hotspot paradox predicts that honey bee hotspots  if existent  turn over much faster than in other species  Previous research has been unable to illuminate these predictions  Therefore  we combined a large sample size with genome re sequencing to produce a fine scale recombination map  This map will be used to describe the fine scale patterns of honey bee recombination and search for sequence features that characterize genome regions with high recombination rates  These findings will be discussed in the context of honey bee genome evolution and the evolution of recombination in general   
The consequences of pollinator declines on the quantity and quality of offspring in two New Zealand tree species  Birds provide a variety of ecosystem services  such as pollination and seed dispersal  leading to concerns about how declining numbers of birds worldwide could affect other trophic levels  One such  trophic cascade  of concern is the potential for decreased pollination services leading to increased production of unfit selfed seeds and  ultimately  population declines of bird pollinated species  This effect could be especially drastic in New Zealand where the flora is heavily reliant on birds for pollination and almost half of the bird species have become extinct in the past  700 years of human habitation  To determine the effect of bird declines on the population dynamics of the plants they pollinate  we examined pollinator abundances  selfing rates and inbreeding depression of two endemic tree species  Fuchsia excorticata and Sophora microphylla  We found high pollen limitation  high selfing rates and high inbreeding depression in most populations of both species  Due to these high selfing rates  50 70   and that nearly all selfed seeds die prior to adulthood  most of the seeds produced will not contribute to population growth and could lead to cryptic recruitment failure  
Is genetic  rescue a valid option for arid zone Acacia   Throughout Australia s arid and semi arid southeast canopy forming Acacia species have been severely impacted by European agricultural practices  Several widespread species now exist only as relatively small and highly fragmented stands with little or no seed set or recruitment for decades prior to 2010   In contrast  however  one species  Acacia ligulata is apparently thriving   We have used a comparative approach to evaluate the causes of reproductive failure and the potential value of genetic augmentation of populations using a combination of widespread demographic and population genetic surveys and investigation of pollination biology and mating systems   Our key findings include striking variation in pollinator services for threatened vs thriving taxa  a major episode of seed production for several threatened species following a historic rain event  evidence of pollen transfer and outcrossing between stands separated by several km and evidence of historic population subdivision and variation in reproductive mode between populations separated by the Darling River and its floodplain   a major biogeographic barrier   Critically our data suggest that sexual reproduction in some species has been limited by drought or over emphasised by patchy demographic data   Across huge areas populations of these species remain genetically diverse and have been maintained by sexual recruitment  although one species Acacia loderi is largely clonal to the west  of the Darling River barrier   Recruitment in these species could be boosted by habitat management alone   In contrast  however  our data show that Acacia carneorum  currently listed as vulnerable  is with few exceptions restricted to isolated mono clonal stands  all occurring to the west of the Darling River  and showed no response to recent rains   While it could be hypothesised that two centuries of increased grazing has favoured clonal genotypes  clonality instead appears to be an ancient response to aridity  Here we discuss the potential for  genetic rescue of Acacia carneorum but question its likely effectiveness   Genetic augmentation may be needed to allow adaptation in the face of climate change  but the persistence of extant clones  the great age of mature stems  > 200 years  and the absence of fruit set suggest that long term selection has favoured clones with high general fitness and limited capacity for sexual reproduction   Only three populations  all with neighbouring stands within 5km  show evidence of fruit set but many comparable stands remained barren throughout our study  
Assessing GIS estuarine habitat predictions with a new statistical approach for genetic signatures of postglacial recolonization  Much work has centered on understanding the impact of Pleistocene glacial cycles on patterns of genetic diversity and ranges of modern species  Here we address such questions comparatively across three fishes in the estuaries of southern and Baja California where slope and bathymetry exert primary control over habitat formation through time  We present GIS based habitat models since the Last Glacial Maximum  LGM  at a millennial time scale and identify lowstand refuges  which are supported by diversity indices and mismatch distributions in mtDNA  Using discriminant function analysis on highly polymorphic microsatellite datasets we determine suites of species specific refugial alleles and calculate the frequencies of these in a geographically explicit framework in all individuals at intervening  nonrefugial sites  Results indicate dramatically reduced habitat at lowstand  120 140 mbsl  with two identified refuges  Habitat increases precipitously after 15 ka  peaking between 12   9 ka  as supported by prior archeological and anthropological work and declines ca  7 ka to present  Using AICc to evaluate regression models applied to the discriminant allele analysis suggests that genetic mixing does not follow an isolation by distance null model  but rather supports habitat origination time as revealed by habitat models as a foremost player in moderating gene flow since the LGM in these three fishes  
Antagonistic effects on survival and reproduction maintain MHC variation in a natural population  Understanding the processes that generate and shape genetic variation among individuals is central to our understanding of evolution  Variation at Major Histocompatibility Complex  MHC  genes  which play a key role in the immune system of vertebrates  has been shown to influence susceptibility to pathogens and fitness  Consequently various mechanisms of balancing selection have been proposed to drive the extraordinary levels of polymorphism observed at these genes  However MHC variation has also been associated with many negative genetic disorders  especially in humans  thus leading to theories outlining the potential role of sheltered deleterious mutations in the evolution of the MHC  In the present study we used data and samples collected across 20 years to assess how MHC variation changes over time in a contained natural population of Seychelles warblers  Acrocephalus sechellensis  on Cousin Island  Seychelles  We have previously shown that in this species both fertilisation patterns and survival are positively influenced by higher levels of MHC variation  In addition  within a cohort of offspring a single MHC allele  Ase ua4  was found to confer a substantial survival advantage throughout life  After massively extending the dataset we now find that the positive effect of Ase ua4 on survival has been consistent in multiple cohorts across the 20 years   However  contrary to expectations  the frequency of this allele in the population overall did not increase over this period  but remained remarkably consistent at ca  15   Consequently we conclude that antagonistic effects must be restricting the reproductive success of individuals carrying the Ase ua4 variant  I will outline how we have tested for such effects using the detailed life history and reproductive success data we have for individuals and pairs within this population  and discuss how antagonistic effects on survival and reproduction can maintain MHC variation within a natural population   
Genome wide evidence of evolution and adaptation in the invasive Florida python population  Analyzing how natural selection exerts its effects on a genomic scale is difficult because substantial evolutionary changes often happen over long time periods in most species  Invasive species  however  represent a promising model for analyzing the processes of evolution and adaptation on timescales that are tractable for study  and have been shown to demonstrate rapid evolutionary responses over short or  ecological  timescales  Such recent invasive introductions often demonstrate rapid responses to this shift in environmental conditions and habitat  from native to introduced   and present ready opportunity to test the genome wide effects of natural selection and putative adaptation  The Burmese python  Python molurus bivittatus  is ideal for this work due to its recent establishment and proliferation in Florida  a location with climatic conditions much different from those in the species native range of Southeast Asia  A 2010 freeze event in Florida led to a large  >50   die off of snakes in the Florida python population  FPP   and likely catalyzed selection driven evolution in the FPP  We used discrete population level sampling of the FPP before  2007  and after  2013  the freeze event and genome wide marker sequencing  RADseq  to test the hypothesis that large fluctuations in allele frequencies  i e   evolution  have occurred in the FPP as a result of the freeze event  We found multiple regions of the genome that appear to show major fluctuations in heterozygosity  indicating in situ evolution in the FPP  and we used the Burmese python genome to identify genes and associated functions linked to these putatively selected loci   
Redefining the context in context dependent mutation  Biases in mutation rates between nucleotides have long been implicated in large scale variation in GC content across genomes  Recent evidence suggests that such biases might exist at even finer scales of individual genes  However  decoupling the effects of biased mutation from that of natural selection in observed genomic patterns remains a challenging hurdle   Patterns of biased codon usage provide an excellent avenue to explore the role of mutation biases and selection for translation efficiency accuracy shaping genomic sequences  By combining a mechanistic model of protein translation with a population genetic model  we show how the effects of biased mutation can be decoupled from that of selection for efficiency accuracy in explaining patterns of codon usage biases  Furthermore  by applying this methodology to several bacterial genomes  we show evidence for widespread mutation biases even within individual genes  The biases in mutation rates within a gene depend highly on the context of the encoding amino acid  However  the context around a given nucleotide   often taken to be adjacent nucleotides on either side   is grossly insufficient in explaining the rate and even directionality of biased mutation rates   
A new island rule for birds  evolution towards flightlessness  Flightlessness has evolved in over one thousand bird lineages on islands with no land based predators  This allows for decreased energetic demands by reducing the size of metabolically expensive flight muscles  The majority of island birds  however  retain flight despite sharing these low predation island habitats  Are these flighted island birds evolving towards flightlessness as well  To answer this question  we examined flight musculature from over 700 species of birds  including populations from over 75 islands  Across the avian tree  island species have evolved smaller flight muscles than their continental relatives  Within island taxa  flight muscles and legs evolve in concert along a continuum from large flight muscles short legs to small muscles long legs  Small flight muscles and longer legs were best predicted by low island species richness  On small islands with few to no predators  most birds have evolved towards flightlessness  including those that must fly in order to forage  e g   hummingbirds   These changes are likely driven by biotic interactions on islands  as they are best predicted by ecological factors rather than physical characteristics such as island size or location  Our findings suggest that flighted island birds have reduced escape and dispersal abilities  The susceptibility of island birds to introduced predators and human hunting may be due in part to their reduced flight muscles and thus reduced burst flight and escape ability  
Comparative seascape genetics of coral reef fishes  integrating genetic datasets and biophysical models across a common seascape  Most landscape genetic studies aim to understand which land or seascape features shape patterns of genetic diversity and population structure across the range of a single species  Whether land or seascape features are consistent in their effects across species is less known  Comparative landscape genetic studies require the integration of multi species genetic datasets and corresponding land or seascape data to look for consistent patterns among species  and consistent influences of land or seascape features across species  However  few studies evaluate landscape genetic patterns across multiple species in a quantitative manner  We use a novel matrix comparison approach to investigate the influences of seascape features on genetic diversity and population structure of coral reef fishes from around Australia  parts of the Coral Triangle  and the West Pacific  We focus on four co distributed coral reef fishes that differ in early life history characteristics and habitat use  Pomacentrus coelestis  Dascyllus trimaculatus  Halichoeres hortulanus  Acanthurus triostegus   First  genetic data  mitochondrial DNA  for each species are individually analysed to reveal genetic patterns across the studied range as a consequence of known seascape history and a species specific biophysical model of contemporary connectivity  Second  to reveal patterns of congruence and incongruence across species  the genetic datasets are combined in a series of matrix comparisons alongside seascape data  Both approaches identified variable genetic patterns across species  despite common seascape history and contemporary oceanography  Some were predictable according to the dispersal potential of species  whereas others were related to particular seascape features  Most notably  likely differences in colonisation timing of reefs within the Arafura Sea drove unexpected differences among biologically similar species  Our research highlights the complexity of combining multi species datasets and offers some novel methods of analysis for such studies  
Phylogenetic investigation of green algae that symbiose with spotted salamander eggs  The green alga Oophila amblystomatis Lambert ex Wille was described in 1909 for green algae that symbiose with salamanders in the egg stage  These algae were shown to provide oxygen and carbon to the developing salamanders  The source of the algae is under debate  Early studies concluded that the algae enter the eggs from the surrounding water once they are laid  Yet  an intimate association of green algae and their salamander partners has been described in which the algae occur inside tissues and even cells of embryonic salamanders  suggesting that there could be a maternal contribution  It is also known that male salamanders deposit spermatophores on pond substrate  after which the spermatophores are taken up by females for internal fertilization  We investigated the possibility of maternal contribution and spermatophore contribution by examining phylogenetic relationships and levels of sequence variation of algae within and among multiple egg clutches in seven small ponds in Connecticut  U S A  We also studied algae cultured from spermatophores and cloacal swabs of salamanders  In general  the algae associated with salamanders represented several phylogenetic lineages  Algae from the two largest  and most closely related  lineages were present in all studied ponds and in 18 20 clutches  Most clutches contained algae allied with one or the other  but not both  of these lineages  On average clutches had algae from 2 lineages  The greatest variation in the algae was found among clutches in a pond  not among eggs of individual clutches  This suggests that females contribute algae to eggs but within ponds different females are using different algae  Some algae cultured from cloacal swabs and spermatophores overlapped with the algae in eggs  suggesting that the spermatophores may be the source of the algae  Further investigations are needed to understand the establishment and ecological consequences of this symbiosis   
 Phylogenetic comparative biology and morphometrics collide  PIC  PGLS  and the challenge of high dimensional data       Studies of evolutionary correlations commonly utilize phylogenetically independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized least squares to assess trait covariation in a phylogenetic context  However  while these methods are appropriate for evaluating trends in one or a few traits  they are incapable of assessing patterns in highly multivariate data  as the large number of variables relative to sample size prohibits the algebra from being completed  This poses serious limitations for comparative biologists  who must either simplify how they quantify phenotypic traits  or alter the biological hypotheses they wish to examine  In this article  I propose a new statistical procedure for performing ANOVA and regression models in a phylogenetic context that can accommodate high dimensional datasets  The approach is derived from the statistical equivalency between methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices  and uses a permutation procedure to assess significance  Using simulations  I show that under Brownian motion the method displays appropriate Type I error rates and statistical power  whereas standard approaches have decreasing power as data dimensionality increases  As such  the new procedure provides a useful means of assessing trait covariation across a set of taxa related by a phylogeny  enabling macroevolutionary biologists to test hypotheses of adaptation and phenotypic change in high dimensional datasets  
Sex determination and the birth and death of species   What promotes speciation and extinction  This question remains an unsolved evolutionary mystery  Sex determination is expected to influence species diversification because it influences sex ratio  population growth  post zygotic isolation  and consequently  the origination and demise of species   Yet  the impact of the evolution of sex determination on diversification in clades such as reptiles remains obscure  Using phylogenetic likelihood methods of trait evolution we find evidence that sex determination  whether genotypic   GSD  or temperature dependent   TSD  affects diversification patterns by modifying speciation rates  but it does so in opposite directions in turtles and squamates   Geo climatic niche evolution appears to mediate the observed differences  We propose that the contrasting longevity between turtles and squamates might explain the reverse patterns between groups  Our approach includes a novel test of the effect that including taxa with unknown states has on the uncertainty of the analyses  
 Genetic pedigree analysis to evaluate supplementation and natural reproductive success of spring Chinook salmon in Newsome Creek  ID    The Clearwater River in the Snake River Basin historically supported large spawning populations of Chinook salmon  Oncorhynchus  tshawytscha   however  extirpation occurred throughout the basin following construction of the Lewiston Dam in 1927   Hatchery reared spring Chinook salmon have been released in many Clearwater tributaries since 1971   These populations are not considered wild because they were derived from reintroduction efforts  but progeny of fish spawning in the natural environment  instream  are designated as natural origin  The Nez Perce Tribe is conducting an extensive monitoring and evaluation effort throughout the Clearwater River Sub basin  with specific long term goals that include estimating the genetic effects of interactions between natural  and hatchery origin populations  and evaluating demographic effects such as naturalization resulting from supplementation  The NPT Hatchery employs a Natural Rearing System technique designed to produce fish behaviorally  physiologically and genetically similar to natural populations   Newsome Creek  a tributary to the South Fork Clearwater River  receives hatchery outplanted fish  directed supplementation    A proportion of both marked and unmarked fish returning to Newsome Creek are collected for broodstock with the remainder passed upstream of an exclusionary weir   Relative reproductive success  has varied  study period 2002 2012  we observed not only similar productivity between hatchery origin and natural origin or naturalized fish  but evidence that hatchery origin Chinook salmon spawning naturally in Newsome Creek may be more successful than their naturalized counterpart  Based on assignment of 2011 juvenile progeny  we observed reproduce prior  years  with a weighted geometric mean of 79  RRS  Whether or not reproductive success at observed rates will be comparable between the juvenile outmigration stage and subsequent returning adult progeny stage is a question that continued monitoring in Newsome Creek will strive to answer but one that remains unclear at this time  
Assessing student perceptions and explanations of microbial evolution  Evolution is a core concept for biological literacy at the undergraduate level  However  evolution is often overlooked in microbiology classrooms  Evolution instruction especially lags in laboratory based courses where the inertia is strong due to efforts involved in revising curricula  We used a theme of antibiotic resistance and evolutionary applications in an upper level undergraduate microbial genetics laboratory course with the goals of  1  increasing students  ability to explain the details of evolutionary microbial genetics and  2  increasing students  acceptance and value of microbial evolution  We presented core concepts and applications of microbial evolution during the course s weekly lecture  One half of the class also completed a three week E  coli evolution experiment   treatment  group  while the other half completed only the traditional exercises   control  group   We assessed the effectiveness of these activities using pre and post attitude surveys and open ended content questions about microbial variation  inheritance  and selection  Students in both groups highly accepted and valued microbial evolution at the beginning of the semester and had slight  but generally nonsignificant  positive attitude gains at the end of the semester  Surprisingly  scores on the content questions did not improve by the end of the semester for either group  We attribute this in part to a lack of grade based incentives and students  seemingly less earnest attempts on the post assessment  Of greater interest to microbial evolution curricula and assessment  we also observed the potential for traditional microbiological instruction to inadvertently reinforce misconceptions and confound definitions of the key terms  variation  and  selection   To develop suggestions for teachers to avoid these issues  we continue to investigate subdiscipline specific definitions and language use  This study highlights the persistent need for microbial evolution education tools  
 Genomic divergence of putatively adaptive genes along an altitudinal gradient in the common yellow monkeyflower  Mimulus guttatus    A major goal of research in evolutionary genetics is to determine the genes responsible for local adaptation to different environmental conditions in natural populations  One way to identify putative genes underlying local adaptation is to use a genome scan approach to associate changes in allele frequencies with environmental variables  Here  I present data from an investigation of genomic divergence in the evolutionary model plant Mimulus guttatus along an altitudinal gradient  Loci were constructed from reduced representation libraries of RAD tagged DNA sequenced from 24 populations using the Illumina platform  I used multiple methods to identify outlier loci associated with changes in altitude and other environmental variables  These loci may play a role in local adaptation to climate in Mimulus guttatus  
The evolution of placentae  complex trait evolution can be constrained by ancient features of an organism s genome  Understanding how complexity has evolved in multicellular organisms has been a pursuit of science since Darwin published on the origin of species in 1859  Convergent evolution provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of complex structures in slowly evolving organisms because of replication of the evolutionary process  and can allow scientists to draw conclusions about evolutionary processes that may otherwise be limited to studies utilising rapidly evolving microorganisms  A fascinating example of convergence is the evolution of placentae in amniotes  mammals  birds and reptiles   which has occurred frequently  most notably in the eutherian mammals  which ultimately gave rise to humans  Placentae are complex organs that facilitate maternal embryo interactions in live bearing animals  We identified genes important for placental functions in the southern grass skink  Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii  using transcriptome sequencing  To identify if there was redundancy or constraint in the genes available for the evolution of complex traits we tested if there was convergent or divergent use of amino acid transport protein genes in P  entrecasteauxii and human placenta  Both linneages have evolved the complex funciton of placental protein transport by using the same non randomly selected amino acid transport protein genes  suggesting that the genome has retained constraints on the way its genes can be utilised for the evolution of novel traits that arose more than 300 million years ago  
Survival in a cutthroat world  experimental estimation of natural selection on stickleback armor   While there has been longstanding interest in competition as a source of divergent natural selection  predation has received far less attention  especially experimentally   In threespine stickleback  Gasterosteus aculeatus  differential predation by cutthroat trout  Oncorhynchus clarki  is thought to be involved in armor divergence between sympatric benthic and limnetic species  To test this hypothesis we have undertaken a multi generation experiment of selection on armor in variable populations  hybrids between benthic and limnetic stickleback  undergoing natural breeding and development in ponds  In five ponds only stickleback were introduced  no predator treatment  insect and avian predators were not manipulated  and in five other ponds cutthroat trout as well as stickleback were introduced  predator treatment   Using samples of stickleback taken every four months over two years we found evidence of strong selection on multiple armor traits  including dorsal and pelvic spines  The strength and direction of selection was temporally variable  sometimes favoring reduced spine length regardless of the presence of the predator  This study provides the first experimental evidence that vertebrate predation favors increased armor in threespine stickleback  This study also suggests that cutthroat trout may indeed play a role in the divergence of benthic and limnetic species  favoring more armor in the open water species than in the littoral species   
Tracing the dispersal of the baobab Adansonia digitata  Malvaceae  Bombacoideae  from Africa to the Indian Ocean region  An interdisciplinary approach  The baobab  Adansonia digitata  is indigenous to the African continent  but also found across the Indian Ocean region  Previous work has assumed that Medieval Arab traders dispersed the species from Africa to this region  In collaboration with researchers from in social science disciplines  I investigated the Arab trader dispersal hypothesis by analysing genetic structure and phylogenetic patterns of A  digitata in conjunction with historical references  Ten microsatellite loci in baobabs from Africa and across the Indian Ocean were used to examine genetic diversity and test for recent bottlenecks  A Bayesian classification scheme assigned individuals to genetic clusters  and phylogenetic analysis determined relationships between clusters  This data was combined with historical records of A  digitata introductions  and archaeological evidence of ancient trade routes  to examine various introduction scenarios  In this presentation  I will demonstrate how interdisciplinary data can be used to determine source populations for introduced species and infer dispersal pathways  supporting or refuting hypotheses posed by botanists and historians  I will provide evidence that the genetic history of baobab dispersal in the Indian Ocean region is more complex than the medieval Arab trader hypothesis  
Intrahost competition in mixed strain malaria infections may slow the evolution of resistance in high transmission settings  Most infections with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum consist of a mixture of genetically distinct strains  the mean number of strains per host increases with the frequency of infective mosquito bites received  Mathematical models have suggested that within host intraspecific competition between drug sensitive and drug resistant malaria parasites  in untreated asymptomatic infections  could inhibit transmission of resistant strains  slowing the evolution of resistance  This effect would have the greatest impact in high transmission settings such as sub Saharan Africa  where higher frequency of infective mosquito bites raises the probability of co infection with sensitive and resistant parasites  Consistent with this  resistance to antimalarial drugs has typically been slower to spread in sub Saharan Africa than in low transmission settings  We set out to test the hypothesis that intraspecific competition between drug sensitive and drug resistant P  falciparum occurs in human malaria infections  We used quantitative real time PCR to determine the densities of chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant P  falciparum in 1 358 pre treatment blood samples from children in three African countries  Angola  Ghana and Tanzania   The average density of CQ resistant parasites was found to be significantly lower when CQ sensitive parasites were present  and vice versa  suggesting that intrahost competition between sensitive and resistant parasites does occur  Additional analysis of neutral genetic variation showed that total parasite density does not increase with the number of strains present  indicating density dependent regulation of the overall parasite population  Finally  two lines of evidence suggested a fitness cost of resistance to chloroquine  First  the densities of CQ resistant parasites were consistently lower than those of CQ sensitive  second  we observed a rapid decline in the CQ resistant allele following cessation of chloroquine use in Ghana  These findings suggest that intrahost competition may have helped to slow the spread of drug resistant malaria in Africa  and may enhance selection against resistant alleles in the absence of drug selection  This work advances our understanding of the conditions that favor the spread of drug resistance and may ultimately help with design of better strategies to prevent and contain drug resistant malaria  
Ecological genomics of incipient speciation in Mimulus aurantiacus  Identifying the ecological genomic mechanisms contributing to the formation of new species is essential for understanding the origins of biodiversity  Despite a long focus on the geography of speciation  it is now recognized that a period of contact may be common during the divergence of many species  Recent speciation with gene flow models have demonstrated that evolutionary factors preventing the break up of favorable allelic combinations can allow reproductive isolation to evolve despite gene flow  However  the genomic changes responsible for this incipient species formation are poorly understood  Moreover  connecting these genomic changes to trait differences and ecologically based divergent selection under natural conditions remains a major  ongoing challenge for speciation with gene flow research  In this study  we unite novel population genomic techniques with classical ecological genetics to evaluate the evolutionary processes underlying the early stages of divergence in the genus Mimulus  In a classic example of incipient speciation  two ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus remain partially isolated due to differences in pollinator behavior and habitat use  However  where the two ranges overlap  incomplete isolation results in a natural hybrid zone that allows gene flow between the ecotypes  To identify the genomic changes that led to the evolution of these isolating barriers  we analyzed patterns of clinal variation and population structure for signatures of divergent selection at over 60 000 SNP markers  The results indicate extreme heterogeneity among loci in the magnitude and direction of introgression across the hybrid zone  providing unprecedented detail into the evolutionary mechanisms and genome architecture that gave rise to ecotypic divergence in this group  
Making sense of floral scents  floral scent in the genus Mimulus and its role in pollinator shifts  Floral diversity is immense  with more than 250 000 species of angiosperms known  The number of phylogenetically diverse floral species that share common characteristics implies a background pattern of selection acting on floral traits  Unique combinations of these floral traits  or  pollination syndromes   are hypothesized to reflect selective pressure imposed by certain classes of pollinators  One flower character in particular  scent  has been hypothesized to operate as an unseen signal to attract certain pollinators  particularly when combined with other signals such as color and shape  However  the contribution of scent in pollinator mediated selection between sister taxa has nearly always been inferred and rarely directly tested  and pollinator sensory mechanisms that drive attraction often remain unclear  The genus Mimulus  Phrymaceae  forms a developing model system for studying floral diversity and pollinator driven speciation using a combination of genetic tools and field ecology    Within Mimulus  section Erythranthe contains seven species with two independent transitions from ancestral bee pollination to derived hummingbird pollination  making it an ideal system to study pollination syndrome transitions   The role of scent in these transitions remains unclear in most cases  but floral scent is known to be important to a variety of pollinating animals and thus is likely to have played a role in the diversity seen in the section   Populations and species within section Erythranthe cluster by floral scent profile despite broad overlap in the volatiles produced   Some volatiles appear to be under positive selection  while others appear to be under relaxed selection  representing differences in selective pressure due to a variety of potential selective agents acting on floral scent   Floral scent may provide a mechanism for diversification and pollinator adaptation in angiosperm taxa  
Into the ant nest  molecular evolution of chemoreception and host specialization in predatory paussine beetles  In insects  olfaction plays a major role in many behaviors  including host preference  Localization and identification of a host by an insect begins with processing of volatiles by small antennary proteins such as odorant binding proteins  which transport odorant ligands in the air fluid interface to odorant receptors located in the antennal sensilla  As specificity for certain ligands can be high  OBPs are thought to play a significant role in the selectivity of the insect olfactory system  Our current work focuses on the molecular evolution of chemoreception and host specialization in an ecologically and evolutionarily interesting group of flanged bombardier beetles with myrmecophilous relationships  Paussinae  We reconstruct the evolutionary history of odorant binding protein and odorant receptor chemoreception genes while also examining functional divergence to explore the influence of molecular evolution on life history in predatory paussine beetles  In addition  we investigate the functional importance of the OBP binding pocket that is essential for interaction between these proteins and their respective ligands by studying evolutionary selection acting on specific sites  
C  elegans harbors pervasive cryptic genetic variation for embryogenesis  Conditionally functional mutations represent an important class of natural genetic variation  yet little is known about their prevalence in natural populations  Here  we describe a vast reserve of cryptic genetic variation  alleles that are normally silent but which become penetrant when other genes are knocked down  in the gene networks of C  elegans embryogenesis  The discovery of this variation represents identification of penetrance modifiers and indicates that the generally invariant  canalized process of early development can be destabilized to produce heritable differences in network function  The cryptic genetic variation we uncovered demonstrates low developmental pleiotropy  in that specific  rather than general  perturbations are required to reveal it  Our findings emphasize the importance of genetic background in characterizing gene function and provide insight into the phenomenon of developmental system drift  in which the genetic mechanisms of development change over evolutionary time  
What is this gorilla doing in my gene pool  Using trans specific polymorphisms as a case study in evolution education   Some genes exhibit an unusual pattern in which alleles from one species  e g   human  may be more closely related to alleles from another species  e g   chimpanzees or gorillas  than they are to other alleles of the same species  This phenomenon  called trans specific polymorphism  TSP   is counter intuitive  even shocking   what is a gorilla allele doing in our gene pool   Nevertheless  TSPs arise from evolutionary processes   Indeed  we argue here that using TSPs as a case study can be an effective tool in teaching evolutionary genetics  as this phenomenon ties together many concepts from the subfields of from population genetics  phylogenetics  and molecular genetics into a single interesting and coherent story  Such a case study of TSPs can also be used as an example of how we answer questions and test alternative hypotheses in evolutionary biology  As a bonus  using TSPs as a case example deepens and reinforces students appreciation for the evidence for evolution   how else could polymorphisms that extend beyond species boundaries be explained but as the result of shared ancestry   Here  we begin with the case of TSPs in the MHC loci  We explore and work through alternative hypotheses that could explain the phenomenon  explaining the evidence and logic that would cause us to accept or reject alternative hypotheses  Along the way  we cover the main concepts relevant to explain the evolutionary principles that underlie this unusual pattern  Among the concepts are those of phylogenetics and tree thinking  the processes behind how polymorphisms arise and are lost  mutation  random genetic drift and effective population size  and the different types of natural selection   and hybridization and gene transfer between species  
Dad saves the day  biparental plastid inheritance rescues cytonuclear incompatibility  There is a growing appreciation for the role cytonuclear incompatibilities play in the development of reproductive isolation and subsequent speciation  Theory proposes they may be among the first genetic incompatibilities to arise during the speciation process  However  this theory is predicated  in part  on uniparental organelle inheritance  While organelle inheritance is predominantly maternal  around 20  of angiosperms show biparental plastid inheritance  How might biparental plastid inheritance impact the dynamics of cytonuclear incompatibility  We address this question in Campanulastrum americanum  a plant species that has a strong intraspecific cytonuclear incompatibility  up to 75  decrease in survival   Preliminary data had also suggested the possibility of biparental plastid inheritance occurring in this species  By measuring plastid inheritance patterns and survival in multiple intraspecific crosses we show that although a strong cytonuclear incompatibility has arisen in C  americanum  biparental plastid inheritance rescues intraspecific hybrids from this incompatibility  Interestingly  our results also show that biparental inheritance occurs at a moderate level in this species regardless of genetic distance or the existence of cytonuclear incompatibility  
The tangled evolutionary histories of Madagascars small mammals  Madagascar is a natural model system for studying evolution and diversification  It has a long history of isolation  88 million years  and supports remarkable levels of both species richness and endemism  including 100  endemism of its native non volant mammals  This striking degree of endemism can be explained by infrequent  asynchronous colonization events followed by adaptive radiation  Madagascar s two small mammal lineages  tenrecs  Tenrecidae  and nesomyine rodents  Nesomyinae   each originated from a single common ancestor between 18 65 MYA and have since undergone spectacular diversification  Tenrecs include semiaquatic  semifossorial  and scansorial ecomorphologies  heterotherms as well as homeotherms  velvety pelage to stout  barbed  detachable spines  and body sizes spanning three orders of magnitude  2 2000 grams   Similarly  nesomyine rodents vary widely in size and morphology and have radiated to occupy arboreal  terrestrial  and semifossorial niches  Because tenrecs colonized Madagascar about 10 million years before nesomyines  it has been hypothesized that their adaptive radiation constrained the subsequent diversification of nesomyines  We tested this by comparing rates of diversification in the most speciose genus of tenrec  Microgale spp   and nesomyine  Eliurus spp   based on multiple unlinked molecular markers  Our results reveal a complex historical relationship between the two taxa and improve our understanding of small mammal evolution on Madagascar  
Pervasive introgression masks the true phylogeny in the Anopheles gambiae species complex  Determining the phylogenetic relationships among closely related species is often difficult due to the conflicting signals from incomplete lineage sorting  ILS  and introgression   In the Anopheles gambiae species complex  a majority of trees inferred from autosomal loci support one tree topology  while X linked loci nearly all support a different topology   To resolve this conflict  we analyzed the divergence times of trees from across the genomes of five species   This analysis revealed older divergence times for trees with an  X like  topology on both the autosomes and the X   We conclude that the X like tree represents the true species relationship  and the autosome like topology is the result of pervasive introgression between A  arabiensis and A  gambiae sensu stricto   We confirmed the presence of introgression by developing a five taxon extension of the  ABBA BABA  test  D statistic   which indicated introgression was common throughout the autosomes   These results demonstrate a situation where introgression almost completely masked the true phylogeny  and indicates a lack of introgression on the X chromosome likely due to the presence of many genes involved in reproductive isolation    
Variation in Interploid Reproductive Isolation within the Campanula rotundifolia Polyploid Complex  Whole genome duplication events are often assumed to confer reproductive isolation  RI  between polyploids and their diploid progenitors and as such are often thought to be  instant speciation   Although this pattern is demonstrated in many diploid tetraploid systems  the evidence for such strong RI in polyploid complexes is sparser  and doesn t always support a high RI assumption  This study seeks to investigate the effects of parental cytotype on RI in the circumboreal wildflower  Campanula rotundifolia  a polyploid complex comprising diploid  tetraploid  and hexaploid cytotypes  Thirteen populations of the dominant tetraploid cytotype spanning a range of genetic distances were reciprocally crossed with diploid and hexaploid test populations  and the resulting fruit set  seed number  and F1 germination rate were measured  2X 4X crosses set slightly more fruit  3   than 4X 6X crosses  However  germination rate was substantially higher  92   in 4X 6X crosses than in 2X 4X crosses  and was commensurate with parental intraploid crosses  A cytotypic parent of origin effect was also found  when the paternal ploidy was greater fruit set was 24  higher  but when the maternal ploidy was greater germination rate was 97  higher  The substantial increase in germination rate in 4X 6X crosses suggests that RI in higher order polyploid crosses may be lower than in those between diploids and tetraploids  calling into question the assumption of  instant speciation  as it pertains to polyploid complexes  
Contrasting patterns of plastid and mitochondrial genetic diversity in gynodioecious Lobelia siphilitica  Campanulaceae   In flowering plants  mitochondrial and plastid genomes should be maternally co inherited  thus cytoplasmic haplotypes are expected to be in linkage disequilibrium  LD   The absence of LD may be caused by differences between genomes in mode of inheritance  recombination  or the effects of evolutionary forces  In gynodioecious plants  such evolutionary forces are likely to include selection on mitochondrial male sterility  CMS  genes  CMS genes prevent pollen production  converting some hermaphrodites into females  Theoretical models of gynodioecy predict that populations containing a higher frequency of females should contain multiple CMS genes as a result of frequency dependent selection  Therefore  mitochondrial haplotype diversity is predicted to be higher in high female populations  but no such relationship is predicted for the plastid  pt  genome except through LD with mitochondria  mt   Here  we documented haplotype diversity in both mt and pt genomes using populations of Lobelia siphilitica varying in sex ratio from 0  to >80  female  We observed high haplotype and nucleotide diversity as well as strong population structure in both genomes  Population sex ratio was positively correlated with mt haplotype and nucleotide diversity  but not pt diversity  Although diversity in both genomes was structured geographically  there was no LD between pt and mt  A reticulate mt haplotype network suggests that recombination has contributed to mt diversity  while significant positive correlations with population sex ratio indicate frequency dependent selection  The absence of either of these characteristics in the pt dataset is consistent with decoupling of the evolutionary dynamics of cytoplasmic genomes in L  siphilitica  
Evidence for natural selection of phentoypic plasticity in Plantago lanceolata  In natural populations phenotypic plasticity often increases with latitude and altitude   For example  in Plantago lanceolata temperature sensitive plasticity of inflorescence reflectance color is positively correlated with latitude and altitude among European populations  This observation suggests plasticity is adaptive in cooler environments  However  this geographic pattern may have arisen via neutral evolutionary processes  I estimated differences in neutral genetic AFLP markers  plasticity  and environmental conditions among 14 European populations of P  lanceolata to test the following hypotheses  1  Neutral evolutionary forces alone are sufficient to explain differences in plasticity among populations  and 2  Local adaptation of plasticity as occurred via natural selection  The first hypothesis was rejected because neutral genetic differences were too small to explain phenotypic differences  Data supported the hypothesis that natural selection has driven differences in thermal plasticity   
Measuring phylogenetic conservatism of extinction in vertebrates  deep time signals and methods  Interactions between extinction risk  heritable traits that confer vulnerability  and phylogenetic relationships among taxa are an important focus of neontological research in extinction and conservation  The fossil record offers a unique deep time perspective on these patterns that is unavailable to us from extinctions in recorded history alone  Unfortunately differences in time scale  the type of data available  and research intensity for different clades have so far made unification of neontological and palaeontological studies of extinction problematic  Here I present a study focussing on vertebrate groups  to determine whether phylogeny can be used as a proxy for extinction linked  non fossilising traits in the geological past   I used three metrics   Fritz and Purvis  D  Pearson s   and Moran s I   to examine the pattern of phylogenetic clustering in extinction in three tetrapod groups  synapsids  temnospondyls and parareptiles  through the Permo Triassic  P T  mass extinction  In addition  given the potential for distortion of macroevolutionary patterns in the fossil record caused by poor sampling  I used simulations to test how robust the methods are to palaeontological data  By simulating  true  phylogenies  then sampling them to represent time scaled cladograms that we can reconstruct from the fossil record  I measured the degree to which measurements co vary on true and fossil trees  Results show that there was a progressive shift towards more clustered extinctions leading into the P T boundary  and all three clades show the most significantly clustered extinction at the boundary itself  This is in line with previous work on invertebrate groups  The results of the simulations indicate that strong phylogenetic clustering of extinction can be correctly identified when it is present  and that estimates tend to be conservative  However  I also found instances where results from the true trees and fossil trees were inconsistent   A measurement on a fossil tree can show significant phylogenetic clustering of extinction when the measurement on the true tree shows phylogenetically random extinction for the same time bin  Therefore  results must be interpreted with caution and in the context of long term signals  Consistent selection against heritable traits over long timescales leads to a disproportionate loss in biodiversity  This occurred in the geological past and an increase in extinction intensity amplified the effect  
Rapid diversification and secondary sympatry in an island bird lineage  Aves  Todiramphus   Todiramphus chloris  Aves  Alcedinidae  is the most widely distributed of the  great speciators  in the Pacific  Nearly 50 described subspecies of this kingfisher are distributed from the Red Sea to Polynesia  a distance of > 19 000 km  We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of this enigmatic avian radiation from six genes and 157 individuals that spanned the entire Pacific distribution from the Marquesas to Singapore  The resulting phylogeny offers strong support that T  chloris radiated rapidly over an immense region of the Pacific  Genetic distances across the phylogeny were remarkably low  Molecular dating suggests that this radiation underwent extensive range expansion and diversification less than 1 Ma  with a diversification rate among the most rapid known of all birds  Incredibly  within the short timeframe of diversification  several instances of sympatry have accumulated in this group on Australia  as well as far flung oceanic islands  including Palau  Vanuatu  and the Solomon Islands  In each case of sympatry  significant eco morphological and behavioral differences exist  suggesting that pre mating isolating mechanisms were achieved rapidly during diversification  perhaps as fast as any bird lineage studied to date  Our analyses found good node support across the entire phylogeny  despite shallow internode distances  We revealed several complex radiations within the ingroup  as well as numerous novel relationships  which require major taxonomic revision throughout the entire species complex  Of the 22 species in the genus Todiramphus  ten were embedded within or closely related to T  chloris  including five species that radiated in the remote islands of Eastern Polynesian and one  T  sanctus  that maintains some migratory populations  Complex biogeographic patterns were inferred from the topology  A major phylogeographic break in the eastern Solomon Islands separates a Northern Melanesian clade from Polynesian taxa  Otherwise  the biogeographic origin of the T  chloris complex was equivocal  likely owing to the radiation s rapid origin  This study makes a significant contribution to the study of rapid diversification and subsequent assembly of sympatric species on island systems  and to the systematics of a classically polytypic avian species complex in the Pacific  
It all adds up  The genetics of thermal reaction norm variation for antibiotic resistance  The thermal reaction norm  a traits response to temperature  is most naturally viewed as a continuous response to temperature and for fitness associated traits  generally shows a slow increase with rising temperature until peaking at the optimal temperature  and then it rapidly decreases   The genetic variation for the thermal reaction norm determines the temperature range of a species and ultimately a species survival in the face of changing temperatures such as global climate change   Here  we investigate the effect of point mutations on the organismal thermal reaction norms for antibiotic resistance in the bacterium Escherichia coli and after controlling for the cell response  for 32 alleles of the beta lactamase antibiotic resistance gene   Antibiotic resistance was measured for all combinations of five mutations in the beta lactamase antibiotic resistance gene at six temperatures spanning 21¼C  The organismal thermal reaction norms have their highest resistance at the lowest temperature  20¼C  and decline in resistance with increasing temperature    The thermal reaction norms for the 32 beta lactamase alleles  after controlling for the cell alone response  rise with increasing temperature  peak around 35¼C  and then decrease  Additive mutational affects explain the 16 fold difference in maximum resistance between alleles  but are less effective at explaining the 10¼C span in optimal temperature   At each temperature  we quantified the variance in resistance explained by each mutation and by interactions among mutations and between mutation and temperature   Holding temperature constant  additive mutational effects explain nearly all of the variance in resistance  though pairwise interactions become more significant at higher temperatures   Lastly  we present a principled model of enzyme kinetics and stability that explains the general phenomena of increased resistance variance with temperature and changes in the optimal temperature in this system   
Unisexual whiptail lizards find a loophole  how meiosis progresses in a species created through hybridization  Although sexual reproduction is the most prevalent form of proliferation among vertebrates  some organisms instead employ parthenogenesis and reproduce without contribution from males  The genus Aspidoscelis   commonly known as whiptail lizards   includes bisexual and unisexual species  with the latter having arisen by inter specific hybridization between bisexual species   We have previously shown that late oocyte nuclei from unisexual Aspidoscelis species contain twice as much DNA  8C  as their bisexual relatives  despite similar genome sizes and identical ploidy in somatic cells  We surmised that an additional doubling of chromosomes followed by normal meiosis allows for the formation of diploid oocytes  Using homolog specific probes  we further demonstrated that pairing occurs between identical  rather than homologous  chromosomes  an important deviation from sexual species which is pivotal for the maintenance of heterozygosity over many generations of parthenogenetic reproduction   We have now characterized events preceding diplotene  Surprisingly  most oocyte nuclei in unisexuals harbor no more DNA than those in bisexuals  indicating that the additional doubling either occurs after initiation of meiosis or is restricted to a small subset of cells   Oocytes in adult bisexuals are predominantly diplotene  confirming successful progression through meiotic prophase  In contrast  unisexuals display a majority of oocytes in the pairing stage known as zygotene  suggesting that oocytes are stalled due to an inability to pair homologous chromosomes properly  Importantly  unisexual diplotene oocytes appear to be exclusively 8C  consistent with the existence of a checkpoint that prevents 4C oocytes from proceeding through pachytene and into diplotene   Strikingly  the small percentage of oocytes that progress to diplotene is sufficient to allow unisexual lizards to overcome the sterility that is commonly observed in inter specific hybrids between species that are too divergent for complete homolog pairing during meiosis  Furthermore  the loss of over 95  of oocytes during oogenesis has no apparent effect on fecundity  
 Biased gene conversion skews allele frequencies in human populations  increasing the disease burden of recessive alleles   Gene conversion results in the non reciprocal transfer of genetic information between two recombining sequences  and there is evidence that this process is biased towards G and C alleles   However  the strength of GC biased gene conversion  gBGC  in human populations and its effects on hereditary disease have yet to be assessed on a genomic scale   Using high coverage whole genome sequences of African hunter gatherers  other human populations  and primate outgroups we quantified the effects of gBGC  on population genomic datasets   We find that genetic distances  FST and population branch statistics  are modified by gBGC   In addition  the site frequency spectrum is left shifted when ancestral alleles are favored by gBGC and right shifted when derived alleles are favored by gBGC   Allele frequency shifts due to gBGC mimic the effects of natural selection  and these effects are strongest in high recombination regions of the human genome   By comparing the site frequency spectra of unbiased and biased sites the strength of gene conversion was estimated to be on the order of Neb È 0 009   We also find that derived alleles favored by gBGC are much more likely to be homozygous than derived alleles at unbiased SNPs  +42 2  to 62 8     This results in a curse of the converted  whereby recessive alleles have an increased disease burden   Taken together  our findings reveal that GC biased gene conversion has important population genetic and public health implications  
Genomic scale phylogeographic analysis of the endangered eastern massasauga rattlesnake  Sistrurus catenatus   Identifying phylogenetically distinct lineages within endangered species can aid in defining conservation units  Genomic scale datasets generated from next generation sequencing approaches provide an unprecedented amount of data for such studies but also present analytical challenges   We conduct a phylogeographic analysis of the endangered eastern massasauga rattlesnake  Sistrurus catenatus  based on SNP data generated using a double digest RADseq method   We first use discriminate analysis of principal components to identify genetic clusters within a range wide set of samples  and then assess whether the clusters represent phylogenetically distinct lineages using a novel approach involving coalescent based species tree analyses   Specifically  we use repeated subsampling of individuals to estimate both topologies and branch lengths for lineages suggested by the clustering results  and then test for significance of branch lengths through comparisons to null models   Our analyses fail to support phylogenetically significant lineages within this species with the notable and previously unrecognized exception of a population west of the Mississippi River   In summary  by applying a novel method for lineage identification using genomic scale data  we have identified a previously unrecognized and phylogenetically distinct lineage within these snakes of special conservation concern   
 Convergence of nodes and internodes  Assessing the monophyly of bamboo corals  Cnidaria  Octocorallia  Isididae  and their diversity in the deep sea   Bamboo corals are immediately recognizable by their jointed axial skeleton  dark proteinaceous nodes alternating with white calcareous internodes   however there have been many questions about the evolutionary relatedness of the four isidid subfamilies as well as the placement of some  problematic  genera   The subfamily Isidinae is restricted to shallow waters while the other three subfamilies  Keratoisidinae  Mopseinae and Circinisidinae  are primarily found in the deep sea   Keratoisidinae has a worldwide distribution and is the most speciose subfamily  whereas Mopseinae and Circinisidinae have a more restricted geographic range  being found only in the Southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean    We assess the monophyly of Isididae and investigate the placement of the problematic genera Sclerisis and Isidoides using genetic analyses of over 250 colonies collected in the North Atlantic  Caribbean  Southwest and Central Pacific  and Indian Oceans   Our results  based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data  show the Isididae as polyphyletic   In particular  the subfamily Isidinae  which contains the type genus  Isis  of the family  forms a clade with members of an entirely different suborder  Holaxonia   Members of the strictly deep sea subfamily Keratoisidinae form a well supported monophyletic clade  and are further characterized by a unique mitochondrial gene arrangement  there are more clades and diversity among the keratoisidins than there are currently described genera   Mopseinae and Circinisidinae specimens used in our analysis are intermixed in a single clade that did not cluster with Keratoisidinae  our taxon sampling is inadequate to assess the monophyly of these two subfamilies  however they are not a sister taxon of Keratoisidinae  Sclerisis haplotypes  n 2  were intermixed with specimens in the Mopseinae Circinisidinae clade   Isidoides is consistently recovered as the sister taxon to the Keratoisidinae and not with the other genera of deep sea chrysogorgids  which form their own monophyletic clade  with which they are currently classified   Our molecular phylogeny suggests that  bamboo corals  represent at least three independent evolutionary radiations  and that a jointed axial skeleton with sclerite free proteinaceous nodes is therefore convergent   
Experimental evidence for both upward instability and decline of the genomic mutation rate across isogenic asexual Escherichia coli populations   Most mutations of any phenotypic effect are deleterious  yet mutations can serve as sources of evolutionary innovation  The evolution of the genomic mutation rate in asexual populations has been studied through both theoretical modeling and experimental evolution  A mutator allele may  hitchhike  to fixation in linkage with beneficial mutations  Recurrent mutator hitchhiking is possible because the deleterious mutational load accumulates gradually  other mutators may hitchhike before the deleterious effect of each mutator is fully realized  Theoretical calculations have predicted that recurrent mutator hitchhiking events in asexual populations can lead to chronic upward instability of the mutation rate that may even culminate in extinction  I am conducting an experimental test of the idea that asexual populations are at risk for recurrent mutator hitchhiking  I have propagated 30 experimental populations of Escherichia coli that were initially fixed for one mutator allele  mutS    These populations serve as a  detector array  for further mutator hitchhiking events  If one or more mutator populations spontaneously evolves a further increase in mutation rate  it is evidence that a mutator population can undergo a spontaneous increase in mutation rate  After propagating these populations for approximately 900 generations  I isolated a random clone from each evolved population  I found that  relative to the ancestor s mutation rate  the genomic mutation rates  measured by resistance to an antibiotic  have significantly increased in clones from 2 populations  significantly decreased in clones from 9 populations  and did not differ significantly in clones from 19 populations  This is the first time that a spontaneous increase in mutation rate has been measured in an evolving asexual E  coli population already fixed for a mutator allele  assuming that the measurement at the genetic locus affecting nalidixic acid resistance is representative of the genomic mutation rate and assuming that the clones are representative of their respective populations   There are at least two potential explanations for the decreased mutation rate in 9 populations  pleiotropic direct fitness effects of new antimutator alleles  or fixation of new antimutator alleles due to reduction of the deleterious mutational load  In the former scenario  a new allele rises to fixation due to a beneficial phenotype unrelated to mutation rate  but the allele has the additional effect of lowering the mutation rate  I discuss ongoing research to test these possibilities  
Exon capture phylogenomics of Australian skinks  The Eugongylus group of skinks arose approximately 31 Ma  and became highly diverse in Australia  with  140 extant species in 16 genera  We are using the Eugongylus group as a model taxon for understanding diversification on the Australian landmass  from macroevolutionary to phylogeographic scales  We have been pursuing this research using the approach of exon capture  and will present data illustrating the effectiveness of the method for generating data for thousands of loci with a broad spectrum of evolutionary rates  Finally  an advantage of using protein coding exons as markers is that a range of molecular evolutionary analyses can be performed    we will highlight some inferences that can be drawn from these analyses   
A within species comparative method reveals reproductive character displacement to a geographic mosaic of interspecific interactions  The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution posits that variation within species results from differences in selection across the landscape  A common goal when investigating within species variation is to detect correlated differences between phenotype and local environmental variables  but a confounding factor is that geographically proximate populations can exhibit similar phenotypes for two reasons   i  parallel adaptations to similar environments  or  ii  because common ancestry or gene flow causes them to be similar  Using genomic RADseq data I applied a migration matrix based within species comparative method to account for migration among populations in a widespread and variable species  Pedicularis cranolopha  We find that variation within P  cranolopha covaries with its local biotic environment composed of a mosaic of congeners across its range  Experimental crosses were performed to confirm the functional significance of floral differences within P  cranolopha  showing that interspecific interactions in this highly diverse plant group promote intraspecific divergences with the potential to promote speciation   
Gene expression alterations trigger adaptve diffusion after recurrent allopolyploidization in Dactylorhiza  Orchidaceae   Hybridization and whole genome duplication have been central to angiosperm evolution  but early generation allopolyploids need to accommodate two divergent genomes into a single nucleus by adjusting organization and function  thereby influencing the adaptive success and the evolutionary fate of resulting lineages  Most allopolyploids have multiple origins  but the long term significance of iterative allopolyploid evolution is not fully understood  Ecologically divergent allopolyploids Dactylorhiza majalis and D  traunsteineri  Orchidaceae  have been independently formed through unidirectional hybridization between the widespread diploids D  fuchsii and D  incarnata  By using over 6 000 informative SNPs filtered from restriction site associated DNA sequencing  RADseq  we document a genome wide absence of genetic differentiation between these allopolyploid lineages despite the visible phenotypic divergence  In addition  we bring evidence of frequent gene flow between the polyploids in sympatry  which points toward a very strong divergent selection required in order to maintain the observed phenotypic divergence  We discuss the reduced efficiency of drift to altering gene frequencies in polyploid populations  and the apparently limited homoeolog repatterning that affected these allopolyploid genomes  a mechanism that has been elsewhere reported to result in reproductive isolation between recurrently formed allopolyploids  By using the sibling allopolyploids of different ages we investigate with RNAseq the progression through time of gene expression alterations after allopolyploidization  and their importance to the ecological properties of the polyploids  We observe a trend of increased overexpression of genes in the younger polyploid D  traunsteineri in comparison to D  majalis  whose transcriptome generally resembles more closely those of the diploid parents  The differential expression between the polyploids is mainly driven by a general parental dominance in opposite directions  a pattern retained in part also at the level of transgressively expressed genes  We discuss the importance of qualitative versus quantitative expression alterations in allopolyploid genomes  and their role for diversification and evolution in general  
Determinants of parasitoid communities of willow galling sawflies  habitat overrides phylogeny and space  Plants have a potential to influence ecological and evolutionary interactions between herbivores and their various enemies  In such cases  parasitoids could drive herbivore speciation by  pushing  herbivores into enemy free space on novel host plants  Host shifts are common in many herbivore taxa  but the reasons for such shifts are unclear  and their importance for speciation in herbivorous insects and their parasitoids has not been fully examined  We investigated the composition of the parasitoid communities attacking leaf galling Pontania sawflies  Hymenoptera  Tenthredinidae  on eight different willow species at three locations in northern Fennoscandia  DNA barcoding was used to identify parasitoid larvae found in galls  using reared adult samples as reference data  In a neighbor joining tree  the reference adults group into 18 distinct clusters  and nearly all larval parasitoids could be indentified to species level based on the reference sequences  The Pontania galler enemy community contained eight common species  and six species that were encountered only a few times each  All of the common parasitoids use multiple galler species as hosts  but NDMS ordination analyses revealed clear and statistically significant differences in the enemy communities on different galler and willow species  The largest difference in enemy communities  however  was found between galler species that inhabit the subarctic vs  arctic alpine zones in the study areas  A two way PERMANOVA found a relatively weak but statistically significant effect for location  The phylogenies of the gallers and parasitoids did not explain current associations  We conclude that barcoding is a very useful tool for studies on parasitoid community structure  The strong effect of habitat on parasitoid communities indicates that  in addition to host plant shifts  entering a new habitat may provide shelter for herbivores and thereby accelerate herbivore speciation  Galler shifts into arctic alpine habitats have apparently led to speciation in at least two parasitoid groups  suggesting that habitat shifts could accelerate also parasitoid diversification  
Evolution of hawkmoth pollination in the gourd family  Cucurbitaceae   Hawkmoth pollination evolved multiple times in the gourd family  Cucurbitaceae   with five of these lineages  together totalling more than 100 species  possessing showy tubular flowers with long fringed petals  GCMS analyses of scent samples collected from the floral headspace of two of these lineages  Ampelosicyos and Trichosanthes  have identified a number of compounds well known as floral scent constituents in other hawkmoth pollinated species  and highlighted some potentially interesting similarities and differences in their respective scent profiles  Furthermore micromorphological analysis of floral tissue has indicated the presence of osmophores on the petal fringes suggesting their role may not solely be a visual one  A shift to hawkmoth pollination leads to a significant increase in diversification rate in one of the five lineages  the snake gourds  but not in the other four lineages  The role of fringed petals as a key innovation in cucurbit evolution is therefore discussed  
The effects of partitioning on phylogenetic inference  In this study we investigate the effects of partitioning on phylogenetic inference   Partitioning is a commonly used phylogenetic method that aims to accommodate variation substitution patterns among sites  Most phylogenetic studies use one of a small number of approaches to choose a partitioning scheme  no partitioning  partitioning by gene and codon position  or optimising a partitioning scheme using the BIC or the AICc  But despite partitioning s popularity  there have been few systematic studies of its effects on phylogenetic inference  and there have been no studies that compare different approaches to partitioning across many datasets  In this study  we applied four partitioning schemes to each of 34 publicly available empirical datasets  and compared the topologies  branch lengths  and branch support estimated with each scheme in a maximum likelihood framework  We find that the choice of partitioning scheme almost always affects tree topology  particularly when partitioning is omitted  Most notably  we find occasional instances where the use of a sub optimal partitioning scheme produces highly supported but incorrect nodes in the tree  Branch lengths and bootstrap support are also affected by the choice of partitioning scheme  sometimes dramatically so  We discuss the reasons for these effects and make some suggestions for best practice  
The evolution of Acacia and biogeographic connections of the Australian continent  The Acacia s s  clade is a dominant element of the Australian flora  with over 90  of the c  1000 species having a distinctive phyllodinous leaf type   In contrast  there are relatively few phyllodinous Acacia species found outside the Australian continent  these comprise 18 taxa found in Malesia and on islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans   Dating divergences of the Acacia clade allows investigation of what were the drivers for the lineage s diversification and the timing of biogeographical links between Australia and Malesia  and beyond   Acacia has rarely been used for such studies due to the large sampling of taxa needed to make meaningful biogeographical conclusions  and there have also been difficulties in dating divergences  due to the paucity of fossils for age calibrations   This has meant that this critical Australian lineage has been little represented in understanding the biogeography of the Australasian region   In this study  we extensively sample the diversity of Acacia species found within and outside Australia  use multiple DNA regions  and apply a reliable age constraint  obtained from the extensive microfossil pollen record  in order to co estimate phylogenetic relationships and molecular divergence dates for the Acacia clade   Using these chronograms we demonstrate that most major clades of Acacia diversified in the Miocene  Divergence dating of Acacia species found outside Australia reflects two main patterns  a recent Pleistocene connectivity of taxa  especially those found across the Sahul shelf between Malesia and Australia  and in contrast  a pattern of relationship indicating older Austral Malesian Pacific links   
Preadaptation to human environmental impacts  Deforestation filters species and facilitates geographic reshuffling in an anthropogenic world  Habitat conversion is reshaping biological communities  yet it remains unclear why some species suffer while others prosper after environmental changes  Given that the majority of large scale human impacts are quite recent  most traits that confer survival ability in evolutionarily novel anthropogenic habitats are likely preadaptations  To identify which species characteristics promote survival after habitat conversion  we examined two closely related species of Neotropical leaf litter frogs with contrasting affinities for deforested habitats  We show that a species  thermal niche corresponds with deforestation tolerance  with the more deforestation affiliated species  Craugastor fitzingeri  occurring warmer climate zones  occupying warmer microclimates within landscapes  and possessing optimal performance abilities at warmer temperatures than the more forest affiliated species  Craugastor crassidigitus   We verified the generality of the role of thermal niche in deforestation tolerance by expanding our analysis to a community of 33 reptile and amphibian species in southern Costa Rica  Mean annual temperature across a species  range better predicted a species  presence in deforested habitat than commonly used traits  such as body size  Because temperature  rather than just vegetative structure  determines affiliation with deforested habitats  changing local temperature regimes as a result of land use conversion may allow species to expand into colder climate zones  We tested for such recent range expansion by assessing the population genetic structure of the two focal Craugastor species  We find evidence for upslope range expansion  of C  fitzingeri into middle elevation landscapes  By understanding how habitat conversion interacts with species  niches we can gain insight into lasting human signature on the evolutionary trajectory of Earth s biota  
A genomic selection component experiment in Mimulus guttatus We combine a field selection experiment with multiplexed shotgun genotyping   Genotype and fitness measurements on plants over two successive field seasons yields estimates for natural sexual selection on thousands of SNP markers dispersed across the Mimulus genome 
Diversification of East African Soda Lake Cichlids  Cichlid fishes have radiated in many freshwater lakes  however  uniquely they have also colonised the East African soda lakes  Lakes Natron and Magadi   The Alcolapia species flock includes three sympatric species in Lake Natron  A  alcalicus  A  latilabris  A  ndalalani  and a further species  A  grahami  restricted to Lake Magadi  Here  we aim to characterise this radiation using an integrated approach combining genomic  ecological and morphological datasets  Stable isotope analysis indicates trophic niche segregation between A  alcalicus and the two other sympatric species in Lake Natron  A  latilabris  A  ndalalani   and geometric morphometric analysis demonstrates significant morphological differences between all described species  However  analysis of genome wide variation using RAD Seq data reveals shallow divergences between species  with on going gene flow  Phylogenetic analysis includes maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods  while population genetic approaches are used to test for introgression and admixture including clustering algorithms  FST  and the f4  four population  test  Taken together  these results suggest a recent radiation with extensive ecological and morphological diversification  
 Understanding Adaptation to Deserts in a Novel Model Organism  Peromyscus eremicus   The maintenance of water balance in animals is one of the most important physiologic processes  and is critical to desert survival  Indeed  mammals are exquisitely sensitive to changes in osmolality  with slight derangement eliciting physiologic compromise   When the loss of water exceeds dietary intake  dehydration   and in extreme cases  death   can occur   Unlike most mammals  animals living in desert habitats are subjected to long periods of extreme heat and intense drought   As a result  desert animals have evolved mechanisms through which physiologic homeostasis is maintained despite severe and prolonged dehydration  This presentation will describe research that integrates physiology  evolutionary genomics  and computational biology to better understand how the cactus mouse  Peromyscus eremicus  survives in what appear to be unsurvivable conditions  Specifically  I will describe the newly assembled draft genome and results of an ongoing RNASeq experiment  These results will be presented in the context of studies of electrolyte balance collected using captive animals held in a specially designed desert chamber  
 The Ruby Seadragon  a spectacular new species of seadragon  Syngnathidae    The discovery of a new large  ornamental vertebrate is a rare occurrence  Seadragons are elaborately camouflaged marine fish belonging in Syngnathidae  The clade is endemic to coastal seas along southern Australia  Two species are currently recognized  the Common Seadragon  Phyllopteryx taeniolatus   and the Leafy Seadragon  Phycodurus eques   both from fairly shallow waters  Here we present a new species of seadragon from slightly deeper water  which shows a characteristic red coloration  We therefore called it the Ruby Seadragon  We present evidence from molecular genetics  comparative morphology  and ecology that supports the designation of a new species  Genetic differentiation was examined using three nuclear markers and several mitochondrial regions   All markers showed considerable genetic differences between the Ruby Seadragon and the other seadragons  of a magnitude to suggest it is a discrete species  Phylogenetic analysis  4386 bp total  confidently placed the Ruby Seadragon in Phyllopteryx as the sister to Phyllopteryx taeniolatus  with Phycodurus eques as the sister group to this clade  Morphological analysis using a high resolution micro computed tomography scan  micro CT  of the new species revealed clear skeletal differences that distinguish it from its relatives  Animated three dimensional reconstructions of the species were used to outline shared traits with the other seadragons and morphological novelties unique to the Ruby Seadragon  Tracing of morphological characters in light of the molecular phylogeny allowed us to investigate evolutionary trends in the body organization of seadragons  Even though the Ruby Seadragon seems to inhabit similar areas on the Western Australian coast as the other two species  they are potentially bathymetrically separated  The new species may be isolated by inhabiting deeper waters  Three of four specimens were collected from 50 to 72 meters of depth  which is considerably deeper than the usual depth range of other seadragons  It is likely that the occurrence beyond recreational scuba diving depths hindered previous discovery  Therefore  the Ruby Seadragon is a glowing example of the importance of biodiversity studies and scientific collections  some of the specimens were housed in museum collections for almost a century but never recognized as a new species  Further research is needed on this enigmatic new species to establish the distributional and bathymetric range of the Ruby Seadragon  to study the biology of this species in its habitat  and to assess its conservation needs  
Extending the Ewens Sampling Formula to structured populations   Recursive computation of exact probabilities of allele frequency spectra  To accommodate the enormous amount of information available in a sample of entire genomes  many evolutionary analyses have relied upon summary statistics or data reduction methods that marginalize over full genealogical trees  An approach that appears to have received relatively little attention involves the Ewens Sampling Formula  ESF   which provides a closed form expression for the probability of the allele frequency spectrum  AFS  observed in a sample of arbitrary size under the infinite alleles model of mutation   We extend the ESF to accommodate population structure  here accommodating migration between two demes  We develop a recursion which relates a sample to its immediate ancestor sample  vertical in time    We then characterize properties of the next sampled gene  given the AFS already observed  horizontal in time    While the AFS probabilities are fully determined by the vertical recursion  their derivation is greatly simplified by the horizontal argument   A rescaling of time or mutation rate that would permit the use in structured populations of the ESF for unstructured population does not exist  even in the case in which the sample is derived entirely from a single deme in a multideme population   For that case  we propose an approximate scaling  which interpolates between no migration and the high migration limit   This approximation provides a qualitative description of the AFS probabilities   higher migration rates increase the effective mutation rate   Under other sampling conditions and for applications in which the exact likelihood is required  our method provides the AFS probabilities through a double recursion that accommodates successively greater numbers of observed alleles and successively greater sample sizes  
Resource abundance influences genome wide DNA methylation levels in wild baboons  Papio cynocephalus   Ecological variation  experienced in both early life and adulthood  can have strong  stable  and persistent effects on adaptively relevant traits in mammals  For example  resource limitation in early life predicts reduced adult fertility in preindustrial human populations  faster reproductive senescence in wild red deer  and lifetime fitness in wild baboons  However  the molecular mechanisms that mediate these relationships remain unclear  Recent evidence suggests that changes in DNA methylation  which can affect gene expression and  via these changes  downstream organismal phenotypes  may contribute to the persistence of early life effects  However  we still know little about  the degree to which ecological variation mediates epigenetic patterning in natural populations  or about the plasticity of these effects when the environment changes  To address these questions  we measured genome wide DNA methylation in wild male baboons  N 66  that experienced lifelong differences in resource abundance  either a calorie rich diet obtained by foraging near a human settlement  or a lower calorie diet obtained from natural foraging in a savannah environment  We used multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  mRRBS  to measure CpG methylation levels at over 350 000 sites  representing over 60  of genes and CpG islands in the baboon genome  We found evidence for a relationship between diet and DNA methylation at 2 fold more sites than expected by chance  Intriguingly  some of the most dramatic changes occurred near PFKP  an insulin responsive gene involved in the glyocolytic pathway  and KCNIP4  which has been linked to obesity in humans  To investigate plasticity in the diet DNA methylation relationship  we further investigated DNA methylation levels in males that switched between feeding regimes in early adulthood  N 8   Both clustering and machine learning classification approaches indicated that switching males more closely resembled low calorie  wild feeding males  regardless of whether they originated from wild feeding social groups or switched into them as adults  However  site by site analyses suggested a mosaic pattern containing molecular signatures of both early life and adult environments  Our findings suggest that some genes are stably affected by early life diet  while other genes remain plastic in response to prevailing resource abundance  
Immunogenomics of non model species  what can Ig seq tell us about the evolution of the adaptive immune system   High throughput sequencing applications have created new opportunities for eco immunological studies and are allowing researchers to study the molecular interplay between the immune systems of non model organisms and their pathogens  In particular  the high throughput sequencing of expressed antibodies  Ig seq  is a novel transcriptomic approach that holds great promise for eco immunology research  To date  Ig seq has been used for only a few organisms  e g   humans  cattle  zebrafish  and data generated from humans have provided new insights into a variety of important areas including personalized medicine  cancer and HIV research  and vaccine development  We posit that the characterization of antibody repertoires in wild populations will provide a fundamental contribution to our understanding of the evolution of the adaptive immune system and will help to advance the field of eco immunology  To this end  we used two advanced sequencing platforms  Pacific Biosciences RS and Ion Torrent PGM  to sequence the antibody repertoire of an endangered primate  Coquerel s sifaka  Propithecus coquereli   We generated sequence data from over 150 000 expressed antibodies and these data allowed us to describe the amino acid variation within the heavy chain antigen binding region  Our analyses suggest that similar VDJ expression patterns exist across all primates  with sequences closely related to the human VH3 immunoglobulin family being heavily represented in sifaka antibodies  Moreover  the antigen binding region of sifaka antibodies exhibited similar amino acid variation  length and composition  with respect to haplorrhine primates  Our study represents the first attempt to characterize sequence diversity of the expressed antibody repertoire in a species of lemur  We anticipate that methods similar to ours will provide the framework for investigating the adaptive immune response in wild populations of other non model organisms and can be used to advance the burgeoning field of eco immunology  
Impacts of Individual Loci on Species Tree Inference  An Empirical Example from Slender Salamanders  Batrachoseps   Species tree methods are now widely used to infer the relationships among species from multi locus datasets   Many methods have been developed  which differ in how gene trees are used to infer the species tree   While these methods all perform well on simulated data  less is known about what impacts their performance on empirical data   We used a dataset including five nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene for 22 species of Batrachoseps to compare the effects of method of analysis  within species sampling and gene sampling on species tree inferences   For this dataset  the choice of inference method had the largest effect on the species tree topology   Exclusion of individual loci had large effects in  BEAST and STEM  but not in MP EST   Different loci carried the greatest weight in these different methods  suggesting that the causes of their disproportionate effects differ   Even though substantial information was present in the nuclear loci  the mitochondrial gene dominated the  BEAST species tree   If loci with disproportionate impacts also violate the assumption of these species tree methods that all discordance is due to incomplete lineage sorting  then analyses may be positively misled   The potential for this problem is expected to be especially pervasive with animal mitochondrial loci  which are both typically far more variable than nuclear loci and highly subject to introgression   Within species sampling was also important  as shown by differences in tree topology across 100 subsampled datasets    BEAST showed high levels of variation in nodal support across these subsamples  ranging from 
A comparison of mammalian skull morphological integration throughout ontogeny  Mammalian skull is frequently used to study evolutionary processes  Under the evolutionary quantitative genetics framework  G or P matrices are usually estimated for adult individuals of the populations and then they are used to study micro and or macroevolutionary processes  Implicitly it is assumed in these analyses that the G or P matrices remained relatively constant throughout the ontogeny  Although cross sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that these matrices are not strictly identical or proportional during ontogeny  up to date it has not been addressed how similar these matrices are and to what extent the differences may affect evolutionary studies within and between populations throughout the ontogeny  We explored this question analyzing both the structure and the overall magnitude of integration of mammalian cranium P matrices  as surrogates to their G matrices   We determined cranium P matrices based on 35 linear distances for 13 genera of Didelphimorphia  Mammalia  at up to eight dental age classes encompassing from the first months of life after birth to adulthood and for Calomys  Rodentia  Mammalia  at seven age classes ranging from 20 days after birth  around weaning  to 400 days after birth   Structural similarity among matrices was evaluated within genus and between genera using the Random Skewers  RS  and the Krzanowski Projection  KP   The overall magnitude of integration for each dental age class and genus was determined for the correlation matrices by calculating the scale independent coefficient of determination  r2   RS and KP results were most often > 0 7  even in the comparisons between Didelphimorphia and Rodentia  The smallest r2 was 0 13 and the largest 0 58  For Didelphimorphia  some genera presented relatively larger r2 for the first three dental age classes in comparison to the other dental age classes  The r2 between age classes for Calomys are relatively similar  These results show a highly conserved structure of the P matrices within and between Didelphimorphia and Calomys throughout their post natal ontogeny  The r2 varied more markedly than the structure of the P matrices both between genera and age classes  suggesting that the intensity of inter trait relationships varies more than the pattern of these relationships  Nevertheless  RS results suggest that independently of the variation in the r2  responses to selection tend to be similarly oriented  Thus the assumption that the G or P matrices remained relatively similar throughout the ontogeny are supported for the taxa analyzed  Moreover  their phylogenetic distance suggest that this interpretation can be extended to all therian mammals   
WHOLE GENOME RESEQUENCING OF EXPERIMENTAL LINEAGES OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER EXPOSED TO CHRONIC LARVAL MALNUTRITION FOR OVER 150 GENERATIONS  Experimental evolution studies that are combined with whole genome sequencing offer great promise into providing insights about the mechanisms that drive evolution  Here we present a genome wide analysis of six replicate lineages of Drosophila melanogaster that have been exposed to chronic larval malnutrition for >150 generations of selection  Compared to six replicate control populations  these populations now survive much better and develop grow markedly faster on the poor food  The selected populations also have considerably longer development times and are smaller when raised on standard food  We pool sequenced 400 flies of each of the selected and control lineages after selection was relaxed and the lines were raised on standard food for two generations  Using next generation sequencing technology  we hope to unravel the genomic basis of evolutionary change driven by this malnutrition and identify candidate genes and pathways that are involved in the response to selection  We also hope this will generate new hypotheses about the molecular and physiological basis of improved malnutrition tolerance   
The role of hybrid incompatibilities in hybrid zone structure              Bateson Dobzhansky Muller  BDM  incompatibilities are the major genetic model for speciation  but so far have been studied primarily in model organisms  We recently mapped hybrid incompatibilities distinguishing two naturally hybridizing species of swordtail fish  Xiphophorus birchmanni and X  malinche  These two species form multiple natural hybrid zones in the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico  and these replicated instances of hybridization provide an opportunity to study repeatable dynamics of selection on hybrid genomes  Using our hybrid incompatibility mapping results  we model hybrid genomes in a range of scenarios and draw conclusions about the effects of incompatibilities on hybrid genomes  We further extend our simulations to understand the role of BDMIs in driving reproductive isolation at hybrid zones under a range of genetic architectures  
Genome wide rates of molecular evolution are higher in mutualistic plant nesting ants  The obligate mutualism between ants in the genus Pseudomyrmex and acacia trees is one of the most well known of any ant plant relationship  In this particular mutualism  ants nest in and feed on the hollow thorns  food bodies  and extra floral nectar provided by the acacia  In exchange for these resources  resident ants aggressively protect their hosts by attacking herbivores  trimming encroaching plants  and removing pathogenic fungi  This ant defense is incredibly effective and their absence ensures plant death  In addition to the acacia specialists  the Pseudomyrmex ant genus includes two other obligate mutualistic clades that nest in trees from the genera Triplaris and Tachigali  These trees have hollow trunks and leaf petioles  respectively  instead of thorns and do not provide direct food rewards  as do acacias  Instead  ants feed on honeydew from plant sucking insects cultivated inside the plants  Despite the differences in diet and nest structure  these ants behave in the same way as acacia nesters  aggressively biting and stinging any intruders  Amazingly  these three groups of plant ants evolved mutualistic behavior convergently  We present three newly sequenced Pseudomyrmex genomes representing species from each mutualistic clade as well as four genomes of closely related non mutualistic Pseudomyrmex species  Despite their independent evolutionary origins  all three mutualistic species show genome wide signatures of elevated rates of molecular evolution  This pattern is present in both coding and non coding sequence and is not the result of genetic drift due to generation time or population size  suggesting that mutation rates are higher in mutualists  We also find a small set of genes with consistent signatures of positive selection in all mutualists  suggesting their involvement in the evolution of mutualistic behavior  Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the genetic features involved in and  possibly  resulting from  the evolution of this complex behavior  
 Reef specific patterns of osmotic response in larval and adult eastern oysters  Crassostrea virginica  from a single estuary   Differential fitness among genotypes in response to environmental variation results in natural selection  particularly beyond the limits of phenotypic plasticity  Understanding the interaction between selection and plasticity is important for predicting species  persistence in rapidly changing environments  In species with sedentary adults  many traits typically show broad phenotypic plasticity  However  when coupled with high fecundity and widely dispersing offspring  there is an opportunity for selection to reshape the functional genetic composition of populations across fine grained habitat heterogeneity every generation  We tested for this pattern of selection using RNA seq methods to study functional genetic variation controlling gene expression in adult eastern oysters  Crassostrea virginica  from different reefs after acclimation to salinity in common gardens  We analyzed 24 adult oysters collected from high and low salinity source reefs within a single estuary after they were acclimated in common gardens at 10 and 30 salinity for 9 weeks  We modeled patterns of expression using reef source  treatment salinity and the reef by treatment interaction term as predictors  A total of 9 921 reference transcriptome contigs  reftigs  23 6   were significantly differentially expressed  DE   with 0 6  of all reftigs DE for the reef source  18 9  DE for treatment salinity  and 13 9  DE for the reef by treatment factor  The reftigs responding to treatment and the reef by treatment factors demonstrate a genomically pervasive pattern of plastic gene expression in response to osmotic pressure  Additionally  the reef specific reaction norms and abundant GxE patterns suggest that the history of selection at each source reef is generating different plastic responses after acclimation to the same osmotic condition  To further test the hypothesis of recurrent viability selection  we made within reef pair crosses from low  intermediate and high salinity source oysters  Survival analyses of larvae over a ten day period  starting 48 hours after fertilization  indicated a significant parent reef source by larval salinity treatment interaction  This result indicates that differences in plasticity in oysters from different reef sources are heritable  Overall  we conclude that reef specific patterns of gene expression and larval survival indicate that oyster responses to habitat heterogeneity are shaped both by phenotypic plasticity and recurrent selection on each generation of migrants  Studies on the interaction between plasticity and evolutionary responses typically classify these two mechanisms as acting within and between generations  respectively  We suggest that for many high dispersal species with type III survivorship  intra generational selection molds patterns of plasticity across habitats such that the interaction between these two processes expands the niche margin  
Evolution of sexual dimorphism in floral scent   Animal pollinated flowers often emit various signals  e g  color and scents  to attract pollinator insects   In plants with unisexual flowers  such signals are similar between the sexes because attraction of the same animal to both sexes is essential for reproductive success  We focused on the reproductively highly specialized clades of the tribe Phyllantheae  Phyllanthaceae  which are pollinated by species specific  seed parasitic Epicephala moths  Gracillariidae   Female adults of Epicephala moths pollinate actively   they purposefully collect pollen on male flowers and deliberately pollinate female flowers to secure food for their seed feeding larvae  Thus  Epicephala moths may have the ability to distinguish male and female flowers  which is crucial for successful reproduction of both the moths and the plants  Here  we present the findings undermine commonly accepted theory that floral signals should be similar between sexes in flowering plants  We found the major qualitative differences in scent between male and female flowers in Epicephala pollinated Phyllantheae plants  In a choice test  mated female Epicephala moths preferred the scent of male flowers over that of female flowers  suggesting that male floral scent elicits pollen collecting behavior  Epicephala pollination evolved multiple times in Phyllantheae  at least thrice accompanied by transition from sexual monomorphism to dimorphism in floral scent  This is the first example in which sexually dimorphic floral scent has evolved to signal an alternative reward provided by each sex  provoking the pollinator s legitimate altruistic behavior   
Exploring the origins and diversification of ratsnakes using anchored hybrid enrichment to generate 100s of loci for species tree estimation  Sampling a sufficient number of loci across the genome is paramount for estimating credible species trees with high nodal support  These trees with low topological and branch length error are important for use in downstream comparative approaches to properly understand species and morphological diversification  Here we produce a species tree phylogeny of all recognized global ratsnakes   83 species  using 304 loci generated with anchored phylogenetic methods  We compare different techniques for estimating species trees from large data sets  but note that we obtain nearly 100  support at all nodes with these data  We demonstrate that the ratsnakes are monophyletic with origins in Asia and discuss processes of species diversification across continents    
Genetic basis of alkaloid resistance in harlequin toads and poison frogs  Chemical defense using alkaloids has evolved multiple times in amphibians  including newts  Cynops  Taricha   toads  Atelopus  Melanophryniscus   and poison frogs  Mantella  Dendrobatidae   Tetrodotoxin  TTX  in Taricha  Cynops  and Atelopus  and diverse lipophilic alkaloids  e g  pumiliotoxin  PTX  in many dendrobatids and mantellids  bind to and disrupt the function of voltage gated sodium channels  a family of genes that encode proteins responsible for muscle and nerve function  Explaining alkaloid resistance is important because some predators evolve resistance to prey alkaloids  and prey organisms must be resistant to their own alkaloids  Alkaloid resistance can be traced directly to amino acid  AA  substitutions in sodium channels at sites where the alkaloids bin  d  AA substitutions that contribute different levels of TTX resistance have been identified in garter snakes  exposed to TTX when consuming Taricha newts  and in pufferfish  exposed to their own TTX defenses   Using Next Generation Sequencing we found AA substitutions at homologous sites in two sodium channels of Atelopus  as well as at a novel site unknown in other TTX defended organisms  Convergence in the mechanism of alkaloid resistance suggests that the binding sites of alkaloids such as PTX can be identified by phylogenetic analysis of AA substitutions in alkaloid defended and non defended clades  We are analyzing sequences of several species of poison frogs to locate the binding site of PTX  currently unknown  as well as AA substitutions that may contribute to PTX resistance   
Performance and utility of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms  SNPs  in fine scale population study  In the era of high throughput generation of genomic data  genome wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms  SNPs  have been increasingly popular in population studies of model and nonmodel organisms  The rapid growth of SNP data in public databases and the advent and accessibility of cost effective  multiplexing platforms provide powerful opportunities to select and apply SNPs on various scales of study  While SNPs have been shown to be useful in revealing population structure with broad scale samples  i e   at the continental or regional levels   it remains unclear whether they provide resolving power to microgeographical samples  and whether different types  e g   nonsynonymous and silent  and numbers of SNPs yield different clustering results  This study evaluated the performance of SNP markers and their utility compared to microsatellites in a fine scale population study using Plasmodium parasite samples collected from Western Kenya  Nonsynonymous and silent SNPs were found to indicate different levels of genetic variability and signature  A small subset of  quality  SNPs outperformed a larger number of SNPs and provided the best resolving power to fine scale samples  even when compared to microsatellites  A cautionary  sophisticated assessment and selection of SNP markers is needed for fine scale population studies to capture and reveal population signals  This process entails knowledge of SNP loci and testing population samples in depth  Our study highlights the importance of SNPs selection and identifies a set of loci useful in tracing Plasmodium spread on a fine scale and potentially in broader areas  In addition  we provide an overview and caveat of contemporary SNP typing platforms with the aim to facilitate decision making between budget and scale of study  
Balancing selection and the recognition system of the honey bees  Recognition systems are almost universally under balancing selection where diversity of a recognition signal allows for accurate discrimination of self vs non self  or kin vs non kin  In many social insect colonies  members are able to discriminate from non members using differences in the cuticular hydrocarbon  CH  profile each individual expresses  In honey bees  each member of a colony expresses a heritable  colony specify coating of hydrocarbons  derived in part from comb wax  The genes underlying variation in hydrocarbon have recently been identified  and include genes known in Drosophila to be responsible for hydrocarbon synthesis and desaturation  Here  I investigate the role balancing selection has on recognition systems in the honey bee using a full genome scans of 40 honey bees  I scanned the genome for shared polymorphisms between Apis mellifera and its sister species A  cerana  such variants are highly unlikely by chance alone and are candidates for balancing selection  The resulting map of selection across the genome yielded evidence of balancing selection acting on genes known to be involved in the development of the honey bee s CH profile  These data are the first empirical demonstration of balancing selection on a social insect and add credence to the fact that recognition genes are among the most diverse in the genome of many organisms  
Whole Genome Sequence of the Behaviorally Polymorphic White Throated Sparrow 2  Population Genomics  Chromosomal inversions are thought to contribute to adaptation and speciation as they reduce recombination  protecting favorable combinations of alleles  White throated sparrows are a remarkable species in which a major intraspecific structural polymorphism in the genome is perfectly associated with a suite of behavioral and morphological characteristics  This polymorphism  in combination with dissasortative mating  leads to the stable maintenance of two  morphs  within the species   Among the behavioral traits that vary predictably by morph include key aspects of behavior including levels of aggression and parental care in both sexes  The unique features of this system have made white throated sparrows a model system for the study of social behavior  With this is mind  we sequenced and assembled to the complete genome of the white throated sparrow Zonotrichia albicollis   Doing so  in combination with pooled whole genome resequencing data  poolseq   enabled us to resolve the evolutionary and demographic history of the inversion  As expected  we find a bimodal distribution of Fst across the genome  with regions encompassing the structural polymorphism displaying high Fst  0 3  between morphs  We also find that the white morphs show essentially perfect linkage disequilbirum across the inversion  Analyses of allele frequency spectra suggest that the  white  form of the chromosome represents a large partial sweep with little recombination between the derived and ancestral chromosomes  Comparison with transcriptomic data from two songbird outgroups indicates that within the inversion  that the tan morph more closely resembles the ancestral form  suggesting a transition from a more highly parental  less aggressive form to a more territorial form represented by the white morph  
 Distribution  specificity and horizontal transmission of microbial symbionts in army ant colonies   Symbiotic microorganisms play a variety of important roles in the biology of their arthropod hosts  Despite this  symbiont diversity  distributions and functions are poorly understood outside of a few model systems  Even less is known about the horizontal transmission of microbes between species under natural conditions  Neotropical army ants  Formicidae  Ecitoninae   predatory social insects known to host specialized microbes and whose colonies are inhabited by dozens of species of unrelated arthropods  offer an excellent opportunity to investigate these processes  We use a collection of over 30 Ecitoninae species from across the Americas to characterize the symbiont diversity at species  regional  colony and individual levels  as well as to understand host specificity of the dominant microbial associates of army ants  Furthermore  we investigate the microbial communities of 15 species of myrmecophile beetles collected from colonies of one of the army ant species  Our data indicate that despite large variation between individual ants and consistent differences between species  the microbial communities of Ecitoninae workers are dominated by the two previously reported symbionts  Unclassified Firmicutes and Unclassified Entomoplasmatales  These bacteria form host species specific clades  with evidence for geographic differentiation within these clades   but multiple and often divergent strains are present within each colony   Weissella  Firmicutes  and Arsenophonus are the dominant microbes in ant larvae  Strikingly  Weissella and Entomoplasmatales are among the most common microbes in most species of myrmecophile beetles  Sequencing of protein coding genes revealed that in many cases the same bacterial genotypes are hosted by ants and beetles  Thus  colonies of social insects  where different organisms constantly interact  may serve as arenas facilitating transmission of microbes across unrelated hosts  We discuss the possible ecological and evolutionary consequences of these processes  including the evolution of vertebrate pathogenicity in a close relative of the army ant Weissella  
Stepwise evolution of social complexity in ground dwelling squirrels  Understanding why sociality evolved in its many present day forms is a central question in evolutionary biology  The Marmotini  a clade of ground dwelling squirrels  exhibits considerable variation in social structure  This variation provides an excellent system in which to explore both the way in which social complexity evolves and its ecological and life history correlates   Early studies on ground dwelling squirrels proposed that social systems evolved in successive stages from less to more complex  In this study  I use a molecular phylogeny to test this prediction  I show that social complexity does evolve in a linear stepwise manner  with transitions occurring most often between adjacent social grades  However  unlike earlier predictions  social evolution is not constrained to increases in complexity  I also find that more socially complex species live in visually open habitats and exhibit delayed sexual maturation  These results suggest that predation risk  which is generally considered to be higher in more visually open environments  played a role in ground dwelling squirrel social evolution  Life history and evolutionary history also constrain social evolution in this clade  Species that exhibit delayed sexual maturation  also delay dispersal and live in natal family groups longer  thereby increasing chances for cooperation  In most cases  delayed maturation has led to complex social systems where individuals of multiple generations cooperate with one another  Together  my results highlight the importance of considering both shared evolutionary history and local adaptation when studying the evolution of sociality and other behavioral traits  
 Cyanobacterial host response to infection by a novel cyanopodophage  and inferred co evolutionary interactions in the environment   Cyanophages  viruses which infect cyanobacteria  are known to critically influence population diversity and functional activity of their hosts in the oceans  however  as yet  little is known regarding interactions over time between phages and cyanobacteria in freshwaters   Cyanophages were isolated from freshwater locations known to support cyanobacterial blooms in Southern England   Of the cyanophages isolated  the majority infected a single host   Some  however  were found to have a broader host range  and one  designated  MHI42  was infectious to strains of both Microcystis and Planktothrix   Using transmission electron microscopy  TEM    MHI42 was shown to be morphologically similar to members of the Podoviridae  with a very large capsid  the size estimation was supported by analysis under atomic force microscopy  AFM    It was not possible to generate amplicons from phage DNA using previously published primer sets   Attempts made to sequence the viral genome has also presented a unique set of problems   Characterization of host growth after infection with  MHI42 was assessed under a range of conditions  and the phage was found to demonstrate different lifestyle strategies across a number of strains of cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Microcystis and Planktothrix   Furthermore  infection of the host by a virus appeared to increase cell growth rate and metabolism   Preliminary data also suggested that changes in temperature can alter phage infection characteristics   These results combine to suggest that  MHI42 demonstrates high novelty  confirming that freshwaters are likely to represent a rich reservoir of as yet uncharacterized bacteriophages   Furthermore  a complex relationship between endemic populations of cyanobacteria and cyanophages is likely to have resulted in differing host response to infection   We hypothesize that within these samples a large community of specialist cyanophages are present that are divergent in terms of their ability to switch hosts over time   Freshwater cyanophages are often touted as a solution to the control of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the environment   However  these results begin to demonstrate the highly dynamic co evolutionary responses between cyanobacterial host and virus  in an aquatic environment which is likely to be considerably more diverse than the marine   as well as the considerable and immediate effect certain environmental parameters can have between the two   This information has clear implications for the use of phages to control naturally occurring populations of bacteria    
 No divergence in sympatry on a remote oceanic island  Cocos Island  Costa Rica    Cocos Island is a small  24 km2  volcanic island located 550 km off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica  It was formed 1 9   2 4 million years ago and constitutes the only island in the Eastern Pacific with tropical rainforest  It has 189 native vascular plant species  including 32 endemics  We categorized the modes of speciation for the plants on Cocos Island using a phylogenetic approach  including species from the source regions for the island s flora  Endemic species were only classified as products of a sympatric speciation event if they had a sister congeneric endemic on the island  and the divergence time between the two could be confidently dated to be younger than the age of the island  Despite having eight genera with more than one endemic species  no convincing case of sympatric speciation was found  A total of 73  of the species were the result of colonization events  while 12  were instances of allopatric speciation  A similar study carried out previously on another remote island  Lord Howe Island  presented a stark contrast with these results  In that case  as much as 8  of the species were found to be the result of sympatric speciation  Allopatric speciation accounted for 25  of the cases and only 55  of the species were a result of colonization  These results suggest that immigration is the main force shaping the flora of Cocos Island  In spite of the physical isolation  multiple independent colonizations from congeneric species followed by anagenesis seem to have occurred in the relatively short lifespan of the island  The prevalence of sympatric speciation on Lord Howe Island was not mimicked on Cocos Island  This may indicate that not only physical isolation  but other factors such as age  topological heterogeneity or the conditions of the surrounding regions play a significant role in island evolutionary processes  Together  these factors determine the relative importance of immigration and the different modes of speciation in the species composition of oceanic island floras  
 The effect of genetic quality on the mutation rate  estimated from genome sequences of mutation accumulation lines   The deleterious mutation rate plays a key role in evolution  but mutation rate variation is poorly understood  We tested for an effect of genetic quality on spontaneous mutation in Drosophila melanogaster using a mutation accumulation approach  Genotypes constructed to carry deleterious alleles on one chromosome during mutation accumulation experienced an elevated rate of mutational fitness decline on a different chromosome  This elevation was correlated with the effect of the treatment alleles on body mass  suggesting that mutation rate is condition dependent  In a follow up study  we now examine genome sequences from a subset of lines to assess the effect of genetic quality on the rate of point mutations  indels  and gene conversion events  
Whole Genome Sequence of the Behaviorally Polymorphic White Throated Sparrow 1  Mapping Genes for Socio genomics  Chromosomal inversions are thought to lead to adaptation and speciation as they reduce recombination thereby protecting favorable genetic linkages   If this is the case  it is predicted that beneficial combinations of genes associated with fitness be located within chromosomal inversions   Here  we use whole genome sequencing and mapping with bacterial artificial chromosomes  BAC  to understand how gene arrangement leads to the morphological  behavioral  and physiological differences exhibited by two morphs of the white throated sparrow  Zonotrichia albicollis    In this species  both sexes occur as white or tan morphs that have adopted alternative life history strategies   Morph is determined by the presence or absence of a large rearrangement  which limits recombination of the second autosome   We have amassed 25 years of detailed data on this species making it possible to identify the genetic  epigenetic  and environmental bases of behavior   To begin these analyses we generated a high quality 1Gb reference genome with N50 contig length of 104kb and scaffold length of 4 9Mb   We then used high resolution BAC mapping to anchor the genome  and in doing so we were able to identify the breakpoint in this chromosome as well as several other smaller rearrangements of gene order   Despite considerable synteny in avian genomes  evolutionary analyses indicate minimums of 11 rearrangements between white and tan morphs  35 rearrangements between chicken and sparrow  and 26 rearrangements between zebra finch and sparrow   Morphs of the white throated sparrow provide a unique opportunity to study intraspecific genomic differences  which have resulted from two separate  yet linked evolutionary trajectories   such results can transform our understanding of the evolution of genomes as well as highlight the importance of inversions as drivers of evolution  
An experimental test of alternative hypotheses for male wing color pattern evolution in rubyspot damselflies  Social interactions between closely related species have largely been studied in reproductive contexts  under the rubric of reproductive character displacement  RCD  theory  Nevertheless  aggressive interactions between species are also very common  yet agonistic character displacement  ACD   a process wherein natural selection acts on traits that mediate the occurrence or outcome of interspecific aggression  is an understudied evolutionary phenomenon  Previous research suggests that patterns of geographic variation in wing color patterns and competitor recognition of male rubyspot damselflies  Hetaerina spp   have resulted from ACD  However  RCD may also have acted to produce the same geographic patterns  and recent theoretical work has shown that RCD dominates ACD when mate recognition and competitor recognition are based on the same traits  To determine whether female mate recognition in Hetaerina is based  in part  on male wing color patterns  we carried out a phenotype manipulation experiment in the field  Compared to control males  male H  americana that we manipulated to have wing coloration resembling a sympatric congener  H  titia  suffered no reduction in mating success with conspecific females  Thus  in H  americana  female mate recognition is not based on male wing coloration  Moreover  experimental males experienced increased interspecific fighting rates  These results strengthen the case for ACD as the process responsible for the character displacement pattern in Hetaerina wing coloration  
EVOLUTION OF FEMALE SONG PRODUCTION IN DROSOPHILA VIRILIS GROUP SPECIES  Many species throughout the animal kingdom use acoustic communication for mate attraction   Typically  only males produce courtship song  as in the fruit fly model species Drosophila melanogaster  but in rare cases  females can acoustically participate in the courtship ritual   Female courtship song was previously observed in the twelve Drosophila virilis group species  who diverged from D  melanogaster approximately 40 mya  Using new high throughput and quantitative methods for song recording and analysis  we confirm that D  virilis group females produce species specific songs distinct from the primary courtship songs of their male counterparts   However  song features are highly correlated between female song and male secondary courtship song  This suggests that these song modes may share common neural elements   Specifically in D  virilis  we find that female song production is important for mating success and signals receptivity   Finally  we show that male and female courtship songs are temporally coordinated  which represents the first demonstration of predictable acoustic duetting in a Drosophilid species   Based on neurogenetic principles of coursthip song established in studies of D  melanogaster  we are developing genetic tools to evaluate the evolution of the song production neural circuitry in D  virilis males and females  These tools  combined with our behavioral analysis  lay the groundwork for establishing D  virilis as a useful model for comparative studies of acoustic communication systems  
Expression of venom homologs in the python suggest a model for venom gene recruitment and question the definition of a venom toxin  The evolution of snake venom genes has been studied intensively over the past several decades  Essentially all previous studies  however  have lacked the context of complete snake genome data  We took a novel approach to studying snake venom evolution by leveraging the complete genome of the Burmese python  including extensive information on tissue specific patterns of gene expression  We identify the orthologs of snake venom genes in the python genome  and conduct detailed analysis of patterns of gene expression of these venom orthologs in the python to identify patterns of gene expression that differentiate snake venom gene families from all genes in the python  Under the hypothesis that the python may largely represent an ancestral state  prior to the evolution of substantial venom gene family radiations   we argue that these data provide novel insight into biases in which genes were recruited in venom production in snakes  We also use data from an oral gland  the rictal gland  as a vignette to understand the pros and cons of using transcriptomic data alone to define  venoms  in snakes 
Early Evolution of the Genetic Basis for Soma in the Volvocine Green Algae  To understand the hierarchy of life in evolutionary terms we must explain why groups of one kind of individual evolve into a new higher level individual as observed in the evolution of eukaryotes  multicellular organisms  and eusocial societies  In the evolution of multicellularity  a fundamental step is the division of labor into reproductive germ and non reproductive soma  In the volvocine green algae  a well developed model system for the evolution of multicellularity  the regA gene determines the fate of somatic cells in multicellular Volvox carteri  The Volvox regA gene has a homolog in unicellular Chlamydomonas containing a conserved protein domain thought to down regulate growth in poor environments  We sought to determine when the somatic cell fate determining protein  regA  evolved in the Volvocales  We report the sequence of regA like genes and several syntenic markers from divergent species of Volvox as well as the absence of these genes in a colonial species  Gonium pectorale  We show that regA evolved early in the Volvocales  after group formation but before the evolution of cellular differentiation  We predict that lineages with and without soma descended from a regA containing ancestor  The variation in presence of soma may be explained by multiple lineages independently evolving soma utilizing regA or alternate genetic pathways  Our prediction that the genetic basis for soma exists in species without somatic cells raises a number of questions  most fundamentally  under what ecological conditions would species with the genetic potential for soma not evolve these traits  We conclude that the evolutionary history of somatic cells in the volvocine algae is more complicated and labile than previously appreciated on theoretical grounds  
Early burst in ecological radiation of birds  Birds represent the most diverse clade of tetrapods  and in the modern world they span across three orders of magnitude in body mass and occupy niches on every continent  When this diversity evolved has been a long standing question  due to both uncertainty in the higher level phylogenetics of birds  and their meagre fossil record  To help address this question  I made 22 skeletal measurements across 604 extant genera  1375 specimens  as well as 336 fossil specimens  The extinct taxa are derived primarily from three exceptional deposits  stem birds  pygostylians  from the 125Ma Jehol deposits from China  and crown birds from the 52Ma Green River deposits from North America and the 47Ma Messel pits from Germany  I found correlations between ecology in morphology in extant birds  and used those correlations to predict ecology in the fossil taxa  and tested those predictions against preserved gut contents in 18 fossil genera and found the extant ecomorphological correlations predicted gut contents significantly better than random  p 
Evolution of the venom gland transcriptome in widow spiders  Spiders are the largest taxon of venomous metazoans  and are important predators in nearly every terrestrial food web  Their venom plays a critical role in successfully obtaining prey  and can also function in deterrence of both competitors and spider predators  The expansive spider Family Theridiidae currently contains close to 2400 species  several of medical importance due to human envenomations  Among these are the notorious black widows of the genus Latrodectus and the closely related false widows of the genus Steatoda  The venom of these and other spiders is a complex mixture of small molecules  peptides and proteins  most of which have never been fully characterized  despite their potential for pharmacological development  Widow spiders are unusual in their possession of a family of atypically large neurotoxins   1100 1400 amino acids  called latrotoxins  which form pores in the presynaptic membrane of their prey  causing massive and uncontrolled neurotransmitter release  We identified a set of venom gland specific transcripts  VSTs  from three widow spider species  L  hesperus  L  geometricus and S  grossa  using RNA Seq data from replicates of three tissue types  venom gland  ovary and cephalothorax   Among these VSTs we find numerous latrotoxin transcripts  greatly increasing the diversity of this toxin family  We also identify transcripts corresponding to members of other toxin families  including inhibitory cystine knot  ICK  toxins  CRISP family toxins  enzymes with toxic potential and putatively novel small toxins  As venom gland transcriptome evolution may proceed by changes in the number of transcripts of a given type  by changes in the primary sequence of expressed proteins  or via the magnitude or spatial pattern of expression of its component transcripts through regulatory mechanisms  we explore each of these potential avenues  We test for changes in gene family membership in VSTs of the three species  whether VSTs are more rapidly evolving at the sequence level or undergo more positive selection than more broadly expressed genes  and whether positive selection is involved in driving the molecular evolution of specific toxins  We explore to what extent transcripts exhibit conserved patterns of venom gland biased expression across species  and whether expression levels of VSTs in general evolve more rapidly across species or exhibit signatures of lineage specific positive selection more often than broadly expressed transcripts  
In search of nuclear correlates of massive boreal mitochondrial DNA introgression in hares  Mitochondrial DNA introgression is the most frequently described case of secondary interspecific gene exchange in nature  Whether this phenomenon is relevant to the evolutionary trajectory of the species or if it is most often a neutral marker of interspecific interactions remains a matter of debate  Given that mtDNA encodes for proteins involved in important metabolic processes  which closely interact with nuclear encoded proteins  we here use a situation of massive ancient mtDNA introgression from the boreal  cold adapted  species Lepus timidus into the temperate Lepus granatensis to test for mt nuclear co introgression or co evolution  This massive introgression is geographically structured  being absent in the southern range of the temperate species but predominant in the north  Using transcriptome sequencing data and SNP genotyping we identified nuclear genes that showed apparent high levels of differentiation between northern and southern regions  mimicking mtDNA but contrasting with the low differentiation inferred for most of the other nuclear genes  which may thus reflect mito nuclear coevolution   
A new method of colour pattern analysis helps explain the existence of inaccurate mimics in an insect community  A  Batesian mimic  is a harmless organism that resembles a more dangerous  model   thus deceiving potential predators into leaving it alone  Scientists have long been fascinated by the astonishing level of similarity that some mimics have evolved  Lately  however  attention has turned to those at the other end of the scale  why do some mimics have only a passing resemblance to their models  when we expect natural selection to drive them to increasing accuracy  Plenty of theories have been put forward  but testing them has been hampered by the difficulty of quantifying similarity between a mimic and its model   Since models are almost always aposematic  their colour pattern is a highly salient feature of their appearance  However this is often ignored when assessing mimetic accuracy because it is difficult to analyse  with the focus instead on morphometric features  We recently developed a method to calculate similarity among colour patterns  and showed that this captures a high proportion of the variance that observers use to distinguish harmful from harmless prey  We applied our method to data from a community of wasps and bees  models  and hoverflies  mimics  in order to calculate mimetic accuracy for nearly 500 individuals of more than 40 mimic species   The mimic species in our study all have similar levels of phenotypic variation  which suggests that inaccurate mimics are not in a transitional evolutionary state  nor are they restrained by a lack of genetic variation  It is likely  therefore  that a trade off limits the evolution of mimetic accuracy  Our data suggest two possibilities  Firstly  in contrast to morphometric studies  we find that some mimics do occupy an intermediate position between two or more model species  They may benefit from increased protection as a result  and increased similarity to one model would mean lower accuracy to another   Secondly  we find an association between patterns with a higher proportion of black and low mimetic accuracy  Dark abdominal colours may be important to hoverflies for thermoregulation  and therefore species that evolve highly wasp like patterns may be limiting their ability to regulate temperature  This tallies with the observation that more accurate mimicry tends to evolve in larger species  which may be better able to retain heat   As we demonstrate  the ability to compare colour patterns effectively has opened up a new set of possibilities in the study of mimetic communities  which is leading to novel insights into well studied systems  
Drought tolerance of locally adapted Arabidopsis thaliana  One of the major foci of evolutionary biology is to identify the key traits involved in adaptation  Drought tolerance is one such trait that can explain local adaptation between Sweden and Italy Arabidopsis ecotypes  which show contrasting levels of water content and water availability in their local environments  To identify quantitative trait loci  QTL  controlling drought tolerance traits and  adaptive trait  QTL  genomic regions where trait QTL and fitness QTL co localize   we performed QTL mapping on 374 F9 Recombinant Inbred Lines  Sweden x Italy  in well watered and terminal drought conditions  We found a total of 72 QTL across five drought tolerance traits   13C  rosette area  dry rosette weight  leaf water content and   leaf nitrogen  Some of these genomic regions co localize with fitness QTL and with each other in defined hotspots  In addition  we found signatures of conditional neutrality  increase decrease in drought tolerance trait in one environment and no effect in another environment  and potential tradeoffs  opposite effect on drought tolerance traits from one environment to another   Finally  we identified highly divergent candidate genes  in silico  Our results suggest that adaptation through drought tolerance may be influenced by many genes with minor effects and that pleiotropic drought tolerance QTL may have fitness consequences   
ADAPTIVE POTENTIAL AND TRAIT VARIATION OF A WIDESPREAD GRASS Andropogon gerardii ACROSS A GREAT PLAINS CLIMATE GRADIENT  IMPLICATIONS FOR CLIMATE CHAN  Midwest grasslands are dominated by big bluestem  Andropogon gerardii that grows across a strong precipitation gradient  500 to 1200 mm yr from western KS to IL   Grassland response to drought is critical for informing restoration plantings and predicting response to climate  We used reciprocal gardens to investigate ecotype differences in vegetative and reproductive traits  Three ecotypes  from central KS  CKS   eastern KS  EKS   and southern Illinois  SIL   were reciprocally planted in Colby  Hays  and Manhattan  KS  and Carbondale  IL  We evaluated ecotypic differences in vegetative  canopy area  height  blade width  and emergence  and reproductive features  seed production and flowering time  across planting sites  We predicted ecotypes would perform best in their home environment  Canopy area and height increased from west to east  with no evidence for any ecotype differences in Colby and Hays  However  in Carbondale  the SIL ecotype showed disproportionate increase indicating local adaptation  Ecotypes varied in blade width  SIL>CKS>EKS   and blade widths of all ecotypes increased eastward  For all ecotypes  leaves emerged earlier in eastern Illinois site  In Carbondale and Manhattan planting sites  the CKS ecotype flowered 20 days earlier than other ecotypes and showed a greater probability of seed production in the western sites relative to other ecotypes  while the SIL ecotype had greatest seed productivity in its home site  The CKS ecotype shows a suite of traits consistent with drought tolerance reduced canopy  short stature  and early flowering in its home environment  Our results provide insight into plasticity of trait variation and ecotypic adaptability in drier climates   
Asynchrony of seasons  genetic differentiation associated with geographic variation in climatic seasonality and reproductive phenology  Many organisms exhibit distinct breeding seasons tracking food availability  If conspecific populations inhabit areas that experience different temporal cycles in food availability spurred by variation in precipitation regimes  then they should display asynchronous breeding seasons  Thus  such populations might exhibit a temporal barrier to gene flow  which may potentially promote genetic differentiation  We test a central prediction of this hypothesis  namely that individuals living in areas with more asynchronous precipitation regimes should be more genetically differentiated that individuals living in areas with more similar precipitation regimes  Using mitochondrial DNA sequences  precipitation data  and geographical ecological distances between individuals of 57 New World bird species mostly from the tropics  we examined the effect of asynchronous precipitation  a proxy for asynchronous resource availability  on genetic differentiation  We found evidence for a positive and significant cross species effect of precipitation asynchrony on genetic distance after accounting for geographical ecological distances  suggesting that current climatic conditions may play a role in population differentiation  Standing spatial asynchrony in climate may thus drive evolutionary divergence in the absence of overt geographic barriers to gene flow  this mechanism contrasts with those invoked by most models of biotic diversification emphasizing physical or ecological changes to the landscape as drivers of divergence   
Genomic Studies of Red Snapper  Lutjanus campechanus  in U S  Waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean  Red snapper  Lutjanus campechanus  historically has supported extremely important commercial and recreational fisheries in U S  waters  but has been overfished for at least the last 25 years   Successful rebuilding efforts and future management of these fisheries depend on accurate knowledge of how genetic connectivity and localized selection are shaping the genomic structure among subpopulations  Using double digest restriction site associated DNA tags  ddRAD   we surveyed variation in >3 500 single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  from red snapper sampled at eight geographic localities  five from the northern Gulf of Mexico and three from the U S  southeast Atlantic coast   Here  we present estimates of genetic structure and population connectivity based on presumed  selectively neutral loci  and we examine the geographic partitioning of putative loci under selection  identified by FST outliers    Lastly  we will present evidence of post recruitment  environmental selection by exploring frequencies of putatively adaptive loci among adult and young of the year samples  and discuss the role of using both neutral and adaptive loci in delineating the population structure of an exploited marine fish   
Molecular evolution of the selfish sex ratio X chromosome in Drosophila neotestacea  Sex ratio  SR  is a selfish X chromosome that kills Y bearing sperm in carrier males  In Drosophila neotestacea  SR is found in wild populations at stable frequencies of up to 30   I sampled SR and standard  ST  X carrying males from across the geographic range for DNA sequence polymorphism at 12 X linked markers and 7 autosomal markers  I found that SR is derived from ST  and inversions on SR limit gene flow between them to cause genetic differentiation  The ratio of nucleotide polymorphism between SR and the autosomes is lower than for ST but higher than expected given SR s average species wide frequency  which could result from occasional recombination between SR and ST  High  stable frequencies of SR  clear evidence of genetic differentiation  and potential long term maintenance through recombination strongly suggests that SR has had a large impact on genome evolution in this species  
Obligate insect endosymbionts exhibit increased ortholog length variation and loss of large accessory proteins concurrent with genome shrinkage   Extreme genome reduction has been observed in obligate intracellular insect mutualists and is an assumed consequence of fixed  long term host isolation  Rapid accumulation of mutations and pseudogenization of genes no longer vital for an intracellular lifestyle  followed by deletion of many genes  are factors that lead to genome reduction  Size reductions in individual genes due to small scale deletions have also been implicated in contributing to overall genome shrinkage  Conserved protein functional domains are expected to exhibit low tolerance for mutations and therefore remain relatively unchanged throughout protein length reduction while non domain regions  presumably under less selective pressures  would shorten  This hypothesis was tested using orthologous protein sets from the Flavobacteriaceae  phylum  Bacteroidetes  and Enterobacteriaceae   subphylum  Gammaproteobacteria  families  each of which includes some of the smallest known genomes  Upon examination of protein  functional domain  and non domain region lengths  we found that proteins were not uniformly shrinking with genome reduction  but instead increased in length variability and variability was observed in both the functional domain and non domain regions  Additionally  as complete gene loss also contributes to overall genome shrinkage  we found that the largest proteins in the proteomes of non host restricted bacteroidetial and gammaproteobacterial species often were inferred to be involved in secondary metabolic processes  extracellular sensing  or of unknown function  These proteins were absent in the proteomes of obligate insect endosymbionts  Therefore  loss of large proteins not required for host restricted lifestyles in obligate endosymbiont proteomes likely contributes to extreme genome reduction to a greater degree than ortholog shrinkage  
Life history evolution and the role of a chromosomal inversion for ecotype divergence in Mimulus guttatus  Organisms demonstrate a diverse range of life history strategies as an adaptive response to environmental variation  One of the most dramatic life history shifts is from perenniality  where organisms persist and reproduce over multiple years  to annuality  where the life cycle is completed within a single growing season  The yellow monkey flower Mimulus guttatus provides an unparalleled example of life history variation within a species  with the early flowering annual and late flowering perennial ecotype broadly coexisting across Western North America  Here  we test the evolutionary relationship between ecotypes by applying genotyping by sequencing to populations from across the species  native range  Our use of 40 000 SNPs allows us to generate the first well resolved intraspecific phylogeny for this recently diverging species   Our results show strong geographic structuring of genetic variation  both at the local scale  and a broad latitudinal gradient in variation  Annuals and perennials do not appear as monophyletic clades  instead the two ecotypic forms are scattered across the phylogeny  In contrast to the genome wide pattern of genetic variation  SNPs within a chromosomal inversion separate out populations by life history  Overall  our results indicate that key life history characters may be extremely variable among closely related populations  with inversions playing a critical role in divergence between populations on a potential trajectory towards speciation    
Asymmetric mismatch in secondary genital morphology increases harm to Drosophila females  Although several evolutionary forces have been proposed to contribute to genital morphological diversification  it is unclear which might act early during the evolution of novel structural traits   We test the hypothesis that mismatch between interacting male and female secondary sexual structures gives rise to increased harm to females  consistent with the outcome predicted from a history of sexual conflict   We mate Drosophila sechellia females to males from a collection of D  mauritiana D  sechellia interspecific genetic introgression lines that possess quantitative morphological variation in the posterior lobe of the genital arch  an external genital structure that can cause wounds to the female abdomen during mating   We find that males with smaller posterior lobes  and those that possess lobes with similarities in shape to D  mauritiana  cause more severe wounding compared to either D  sechellia males with strain specific morphologies or introgression males that possess larger lobes or lobes with more pronounced D  sechellia features   These results suggest a possible history of sexual conflict during the evolution of the posterior lobe in D  sechellia  but also suggest a potential contribution of divergence in sensory recognition mechanisms to posterior lobe evolution  
Is the ectomycorrhizal lifestyle an evolutionary key innovation  Trophic evolution in the Tricholomatoid clade  Agaricales   The Tricholomatoid clade is one of several major clades of Agaricales  the largest order of mushroom forming fungi  Members of this clade exhibit variation in nutritional modes  including mycoparasites  saprotrophs  termite associates  and ectomycorrhizal  ECM  symbionts  The Tricholomatoid clade represents an ideal group for the study of evolution of the ECM habit because it contains a variation of trophic modes and independent origins of the ECM association  Here  we evaluate whether the ECM mode is a key innovation that promoted diversification within the Tricholomatoid clade  Nutritional modes are inferred from carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures  We will reconstruct a time calibrated phylogenetic tree and identify any diversification rate shifts  In order to detect the effect of switches from saprotrophic to ECM mode on diversification rates and to evaluate whether these switches represent an evolutionary key innovation  we will implement the binary state speciation and extinction model  BiSSE   Thus  evidence will be presented to accept or reject the hypothesis that ECM mode represents a key innovation that promoted diversification in the Tricholomatoid clade  
Evaluating the immediate capacity for ongoing adaptation  Adaptation of natural populations has been assessed almost exclusively retrospectively  but insight into the capacity for ongoing adaptation is also valuable  both to ground understanding of the dynamics of the adaptive process and to inform management of populations as environment changes   A populations capacity for immediate adaptation is set by its additive genetic variance for lifetime fitness  Va W    as RA Fisher showed   Estimates of Va W  and the distribution of additive genetic effects on fitness for populations of the annual plant  Chamaecrista fasciculata  and the long lived perennial  Echinacea angustifolia  will be presented  and their implications will be considered  
Biting into it  Occlusion and development force correlations and anticorrelations in dental characters  Since fossils are indispensable to date phylogenies and answer comparative questions  scoring morphological characters from the best remains available is a critical step in many evolutionary studies  Among mammals  teeth are exceptionally well preserved and important sources of characters for phylogenetic analyses  We simulated character matrices based on a matrix of 278 dental characters that was designed to infer the phylogeny of very incomplete Miocene fossils from an ecologically hyperdiverse clade of mammals  Compared to the simulated matrices  the observed data had clusters of extremely high and low similarity  indicating both correlations and anticorrelations in character states  Analyses of character ontology revealed occluding premolars and molars were significantly more likely to encode identical character states  while dental features from adjacent locations were more likely to encode completely dissimilar patterns  We propose that selection for functional occlusion underlies the excess similarity in molar and premolars  and developmental programs for individual dental loci explain the extreme dissimilarity in character states  Out results reject the assumption of character independence implicit in the vast majority of analyses integrating phenotypic characters  and caution against collecting large matrices under the presumption that more is more  
Climate change and the high fitness costs of seasonal camouflage mismatch in snowshoe hares  Decreasing snow cover duration is one of the strongest signals of climate change across the temperate zone of the Northern hemisphere   The resulting later onset of snow in the fall and earlier loss of snow in the spring represents a new  potentially severe stressor for at least 11 color molting species and their respective communities   Snowshoe hares  Lepus americanus   an important prey species for many forest carnivores  molt from brown to white in winter to match their background and avoid detection from predators   The mistiming between ground snow cover presence and photoperiod induced color molts results in camouflage mismatch during spring and fall   We previously found minimal plasticity in either seasonal color molt phenology to track seasonal snowpack or anti predatory behaviors to minimize color mismatch  implying a 4 8 fold increase in mismatch by the end of the century   Here  we investigated the cost of color mismatch and the potential to adapt to the increasing mismatch through evolution  We observed nearly 200 wild hares over three widely disparate snow years and two study sites in Montana  USA  and monitored their survival  coat color molt phenology and color mismatch weekly using radiotelemetry   First  we found high variation in phenology of coat color molts and consequently in color mismatch between individuals   Next  we detected high fitness costs of mismatch  with hares suffering 3  7  lower weekly survival rates when color mismatched   Without adaptive changes in the molt phenology  these fitness costs coupled with decreasing duration of snow season were projected to decrease annual survival by 12  by mid century and 24  by late century   Such decreases in survival could be sufficient to cause hare populations to decline strongly towards extinction  with annual geometric growth rate decreasing by 11   24   by mid  late  century  However  because natural selection is operating against color mismatch and there is a substantial individual variation in coat color phenology  we conclude that there is a strong potential for evolution to rescue hares from the dire consequences of camouflage mismatch  
Eco evo dynamics of mutualism decline in response to nitrogen fertilization  Mutualisms are predicted to be evolutionarily unstable and sensitive to environmental change  Given the importance of mutualisms in nature  understanding how mutualisms evolve in response to global changes such as nitrogen  N  deposition  and how these evolutionary responses feed back on ecological processes  might be important for predictions of community and ecosystem level responses  Such feedbacks are particularly likely for ecologically important mutualisms  such as the legume rhizobium symbiosis  in which traded benefits play a roles in structuring the plant community and mediating nutrient cycles  In the legume rhizobium resource mutualism  symbiotic rhizobia provide their legume hosts with fixed N in return for plant photosynthates  Theory predicts that increased N availability should favor the evolution of less beneficial rhizobium symbionts  We isolated clover associated Rhizobium from replicated N fertilized and control plots in the Kellogg Biological Station LTER and tested these strains in controlled greenhouse experiments to study how 22 years of N fertilization have influenced the stability of the legume rhizobium mutualism  We found that fertilization led to the evolution of rhizobia that are less beneficial for clover hosts  as evidenced by smaller plants with lower chlorophyll content  Genetic analyses implicate microevolution  and horizontal gene transfer of genes on the symbiosis plasmid  in this phenotypic change  Moreover these evolutionary effects are not limited to the mutualist partners themselves  In a community mesocosm experiment  inoculation with N adapted rhizobia shifted plant community composition to favor grasses and forbs  at the expense of clover species  and also caused soil nitrate and ammonium pools to decline  The results of several experiments thus suggest that the evolution of benefits in the legume rhizobium mutualism  and ultimately mutualism stability  depend on N availability  Moreover these microevolutionary responses scale up to influence ecological interactions in the plant community  shifting the abundance of functional groups  and altering ecosystem level processes  soil N availability   Mutualism evolution might play a surprisingly important role in predicting community and ecosystem responses to global environmental change  
Bayesian Co estimation of Selfing Rate and Locus Specific Mutation Rates for a Partially Selfing Population  We present a novel Bayesian method for inferring the selfing rate and scaled mutation rates in a partially selfing population  We use the infinite alleles model  and obtain the likelihood for diploid samples by extending the Ewens Sampling Formula to account for partial selfing  Our method allows inference from multi locus data under a model that accounts for mutation rate variation by allowing each locus to draw a mutation rate from a common distribution of mutation rates  This distribution is itself estimated from the data  We construct an MCMC algorithm and apply this model to an androdioecious population  jointly inferring the frequencies of males and hermaphrodites along with the selfing rate and other model parameters  
 Rapid evolution and duplication of a key centromeric protein in Mimulus  a genus with female meiotic drive   Centromeres mediate faithful segregation of chromosomes and are defined by the centromere specific histone  CENH3   In all eukaryotes  CENH3 assembles the kinetochore  the proteinaceous structure that links chromatin with spindle microtubules to organize chromosomal movement   Despite its essential and conserved function  CENH3 evolves rapidly and adaptively across plants and animals   Female meiotic drive of selfishly evolving centromeres has been hypothesized to explain this pattern   Under this model  the fundamental asymmetry of female meiosis fuels an evolutionary  arms race  between centromeres and kinetochore proteins  such as CENH3   the byproduct of which is extreme sequence divergence   Although theorized to be a widespread and potent evolutionary force  there is scant empirical evidence of centromeric drive and much remains unknown about the nature and consequences of antagonistic coevolution between centromeric DNA and kinetochore proteins   Here  we investigate the molecular evolutionary patterns of CENH3 across Mimulus  the genus with the empirical model for centromere associated meiotic drive  Mimulus guttatus   We sequenced CENH3 genus wide and  intriguingly  discovered a duplication that dates to a period of dynamic chromosomal and centromere evolution   We find that 1  the two copies are expressed and highly divergent  with most divergence concentrated in the meiosis specific N terminal  2  there are signatures of long term positive selection acting on both duplicates  3  both inter  and intra specific patterns of variation suggest the paralogs are under different selective regimes and are on distinct evolutionary trajectories   Our results show that centromere associated drive can have profound effects on the pattern of genetic variation at key kinetochore proteins  and may directly play a role in promoting diversity at centromeres and centromeric proteins  
Exploring reticulate evolution in Amaryllidaceae tribe Hippeastreae using target enrichment and NGS of low copy nuclear markers  Amaryllidaceae tribe Hippeastreae constitute a horticulturally valuable group of approximately 180 species of American petaloid monocots  characterized by disploidy and polyploidy  x   6  8  9  10  11  2n   12 150   A recent hypothesis based on ITS and chloroplast sequence data states that Hippeastreae experienced ancient diploid hybridization s  that preceded the radiation of the major subclade  Hippeastrinae  Additionally  the Hippeastrinae have likely gone through successive events of allopolyploidization  which further obscure the inference of phylogeny and form a complex network like pattern of evolution  We used transcriptomic data to identify putative single copy nuclear genes in Hippeastreae and developed biotinylated RNA baits  MYbaits  to capture 48 genes longer than 2 Kb  Illumina DNA libraries were built for  68 taxa  and pooled libraries were used in capture experiments  Captured genes were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform  2x150 or 2x250 paired end reads   Great care was taken to address the assembly of in paralogs  which are likely to be encountered in a group with such a complex and reticulate pattern of evolution as Hippeastreae  Given the complex data  and our previous knowledge and hypotheses about the phylogeny of Hippeastreae  multiple markers were thoroughly and individually analyzed to compare gene trees  Several tests of the deep reticulation hypothesis were performed  including recombination detection  Lento plots  and network analyses  The resulting phylogenetic framework will serve as a basis for understanding patterns of character evolution in Hippeastreae and for reclassification of the tribe at the genus level  
Convergent evolution of alternative developmental trajectories associated with diapause in African and South American killifish  There are several contrasting views of conservation during vertebrate embryology  One view is that early development is conserved because it cannot readily be changed without disrupting later development  In contrast  Darwin argued that all stages of development are potentially subject to adaptive diversification  but early development tends to be conserved because embryos reside in an egg or their mother s womb and hence are not exposed to strong selection  Raff s hourglass model represents a sort of compromise between these views  it accommodates known diversity in early development owing to different egg types and starting material  but retains the notion of developmental constraint and hence conservatism with respect to a mid embryogenesis phylotypic period  characterized by the patterning of the main features of the adult body plan  Short lived annual killifish enable us to contrast these different models  and support Darwins view of embryology  Annual killifish are adapted to life in seasonally ephemeral water bodies and persist through the production of desiccation resistant eggs that undergo long periods of diapause  or developmental arrest  enabling them to traverse the inhospitable dry season  Environmental cues that indicate the season govern whether eggs enter a stage of diapause mid way through development or skip this diapause and are direct developing  We report  based on construction of a supermatrix phylogenetic tree of the order Cyprinodontiformes and a battery of comparative analyses  that the ability to produce diapause eggs evolved independently at least six times within African and South American killifish  We then show that in species representative of these lineages  embryos destined to enter diapause display significant reduction in development of the cranial region and circulatory system relative to direct developing embryos  This divergence along alternative developmental pathways begins mid way through development  well before diapause is entered  during a period of purported maximum developmental constraint  the phylotypic period   Finally  we show that entering diapause is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in metabolic rate and concomitant increase in long term embryo survival  Morphological divergence during the phylotypic period thus allows embryos undergoing diapause to conserve energy by shunting resources away from energetically costly organs  brain and heart  thereby increasing survival chances in an environment that necessitates remaining dormant  buried in the soil  and surrounded by an egg shell for much of the year  Our results indicate that adaptation to seasonal aquatic environments in annual killifish imposes strong selection during the embryo stage leading to marked diversification during this otherwise conserved period of vertebrate development    
Nextgen data and phylogenetics   can we ignore incomplete lineage sorting and gene tree species tree conflict in phylogenetics   One of the major areas of research in phylogenetics is whether and how to combine data from multiple markers when estimating phylogenies   Using multiple markers introduces the possibility of conflict among markers due to incomplete lineage sorting and gene trees that do not reflect the  true  species tree   These issues are extremely relevant given the large number of markers generated by NextGen sequencing technologies   Using over 6000 genes from closely related Drosophila species  we simulated NextGen datasets based on 100 bp and 500 bp reads from these genes   We demonstrate that concatenation of sequences from all loci produces a highly supported species tree even though roughly 40  of the genes produce alternate topologies when analyzed singly   Furthermore  the results are robust to changes in sequence length  demonstrating that improved sequencing technologies yielding more data will not change the outcome  We suggest that the sheer volume of data from markers scattered across the genome will produce highly supported species tree even when the phylogenetic histories of some of those markers are inconsistent with the species trees   
Improving model based phylogeographic inference by developing new spatially explicit summary statistics  Improving our understanding of the relative contribution of different historical processes on structuring populations and species is at the forefront of phylogeographic research  Such understanding is of pressing importance in light of the drastic ongoing landscape and climate changes  To assess the relative likelihood of different plausible evolutionary histories  it is often useful to distill raw population genetic data into a small set of summary statistics that capture information relevant to competing evolutionary histories  However  the traditional population genetic summary statistics used overlook the spatial component of genetic variation  and to overcome this limitation  we present a large set of novel and informative spatially explicit summary statistics focused on assessing the degree of spatial distribution and autocorrelation of genetic variation  We then use spatial demographic and genetic simulations to illustrate their utility for model based phylogeography by assessing their behavior and performance under two alternative classes of demographic histories that involve expansion and admixture from multiple refugia  cyclical expansion and single expansion  A comparison of the two classes of demographic histories show that both histories could be distinguished by a combination of new and classical summary statistics under a range of parameter values  although they were almost indistinguishable when employing only classical summary statistics  In line with this finding  spatial summary statistics constituted more than 75  of the top 10 most discerning statistics in discriminant function analyses  These results  which were consistent under two different simulated scenarios of cyclical and single expansion  confirm that the use of spatially explicit summary statistics has the potential to substantially improve our ability to use geo referenced genetic data to test alternative complex species histories  Together with classical non spatial summary statistics  this new set of spatial statistics offer a valuable instrument to understand how past events shapes genetic diversity  Future developments in the selection of meaningful sets of statistics together with further integration of spatial analyses into statistical inference approaches are expected to provide valuable insights into species and community responses to environmental changes   Keywords  climate change  model based phylogeography  range expansion  summary statistics 
RNA seq reveals strong evidence of positive selection and gene expression differences over 20 million years of evolution in Heteromyid rodents  When populations evolve under disparate environmental conditions  they experience different selective pressures that shape patterns of sequence evolution and gene expression   These  in turn  may be manifested in genetic and phenotypic differences between species   For instance  water scarcity may drive adaptations for efficient osmoregulation in desert species that are relaxed or absent in related species from mesic habitats   Desert rodents have been shown to have an extraordinary ability to retain water during waste production   Although much is known regarding the unique kidney physiology of kangaroo rats  Dipodomys spp   and their ability to retain water during waste production  the genetic basis of these physiological adaptations to desert life is relatively unknown   Here  we utilized RNA seq data to conduct a comparative study to identify osmoregulatory genes expressed in Heteromyid rodents   We sequenced kidney tissue from two temperate desert species  Dipodomys spectabilis and Chaetodipus baileyi  from two separate subfamilies of the Heteromyidae and compared these transcriptomes to a tropical mesic species  Heteromys desmarestianus  from a third subfamily   The evolutionary history of these subfamilies provided a robust phylogenetic control that allowed us to separate shared evolutionary history from convergence   Using two methods to detect differential expression  DE   we identified 1 890 genes that showed consistent patterns of DE between the arid and mesic species   A three species  reciprocal BLAST analysis revealed 3 511 sets of putative orthologues that  upon comparison to known Mus musculus sequences  identified 323 annotated and full length genic regions   Selection tests displayed evidence of positive selection  dn ds >1  on 6 genes in the two desert species and remained significant for one of these genes after correction for multiple testing   Additionally  we took advantage of the geographic distribution of these species to explore whether species from tropical latitudes have a more diverse immunogenetic repertoire due to exposure to greater parasite burden   To test this idea we compared the spleen transcriptomes of the tropical species  H  desmarestianus  to the two temperate species   In this comparison we identified 632 genes that were consistently upregulated in H  desmarestianus and 492 genes that were consistently downregulated in H  desmarestianus   Additionally  we found some evidence of immune related gene ontology terms that were overrepresented in H  desmarestianus   Thus we find consistent differences in evolution of genes expressed in two tissues   Due to strong natural selection in disparate environments  these genes have evolved differently in related species in terms of expression levels and or nucleotide sequence  
The genomics of adaptation and divergence in a wild sunflower  Helianthus argophyllus is a wild sunflower that exhibits striking phenotypic variation across its small native range in south Texas  Populations growing on the coast include some individuals who flower early  in mid Summer  and grow only about a meter tall  while other individuals flower in early Fall and can reach heights of over four meters  Populations growing inland are almost uniformly tall and late flowering  In a common garden  late flowering plants produced more flowers  potentially due to their longer growing season  but our 2011 field study of natural selection in wild populations shows strong evidence for directional selection on early flowering  especially in coastal populations  A comparison of flowering time and height QST values to nuclear SNP FST values supports this hypothesis of divergent selection  We then investigated the genetic architecture of adaptation and divergence in this system  using transcriptome data to identify outlier loci and peaks of genomic divergence between inland and coastal populations   Candidate genes for salt tolerance are associated with peaks of genomic divergence  which is sensible given the saline habitats of coastal populations   However  we found no genes related to flowering time among the outlier loci or underlying the divergence peaks  suggesting that selection on another trait may be acting pleiotropically on flowering time  or that the key differences may be in non coding regulatory sequence    
A general nonparametric method for correcting the allele frequency spectrum for misidentified ancestral states  The allele frequency spectrum is an effective tool for the detection of positive selection  But the power of the frequency spectrum depends on being able to correctly determine which alleles are derived and which are ancestral  Misidentification of the derived state mimics the effect of positive selection  leading to frequent false positives  The problem is compounded when the variants are indels  because misidentification leads to classifying an insertion as a deletion  and vice versa   The ancestral allele is often determined by estimating the allele carried by the common ancestor of the lineage of interest and an outgroup species  and using this as a proxy for the true ancestral allele   This is problematic  even when a probabilistic model is used to do so  due to multiple mutations on the lineage of interest   Requiring consistency with additional outgroup species does not fully resolve the misidentification and results in much of the data being discarded  Here we present a straightforward nonparametric method for correcting the observed allele frequency spectrum for misidentified ancestral states  The method uses the frequency of polymorphic and fixed site patterns to estimate the ancestral state probabilities and treats the observed allele frequency spectrum as a mixture of correctly identified and misidentified sites  The method makes no assumptions about the presence or absence of natural selection  the model of evolution  or the exact phylogenetic tree relating the species  Additionally the method can be used for both SNPs and indels and can be used with any group of species  
The shape of adaptive genetic covariance  Chromosome walking using population graphs  Throughout the genome  regions that have experienced selection can be identified by changes in structure and diversity   Indeed  outlier analyses have provided valuable insights into how selection has operated throughout the genome   Outlier status  while sufficient to hypothesize selection  is not necessarily the only physical signature that selection leave in the genome   Selection may change the covariance among populations yet not result in a net increase in divergence  there are many alternative neutral and adaptive histories that lead to the same exact FstÉ  Here I present work on quantifying the topographic shape of adaptive genetic covariance   Selection changes the shape of covariance defined in a population graph  deviating from neutral history in predictable ways   By focusing on the shape of covariance rather than the amount of divergence  population graphs can be used to classify alternative  outlier  genomic regions into groups based upon the way in which selection changed among population covariance   A topological focus also allows the testing of hypotheses based upon external features such as genomic inferences  e g   What else in the genome has covariance shaped like LCT    phenotypic changes  e g   What regions are congruent with among population differences in morphology    and environmental conditions  e g   Where is covariance structured in a way that matches changes in altitude     I close by discussing the general utility of adopting a topological approach to identifying and understanding putatively adaptive genomic regions and its utility in non model systems  
 Ecological divergence  adaptive radiation and the evolution of sexual signaling traits in a complex of Australian agamid lizards   Diversification is often linked to either ecological diversification or sexual signal evolution  We explore the contribution of adaptive and sexual signal evolution in the radiation of the Ctenophorus maculatus species complex using species trees  multivariate niche comparisons and comparative phylogenetic analyses  In the C  maculatus complex  lineages have radiated in response to arid sand habitat development  with ecological and phenotypic diversification in ecomorphology  dorsal marking  chemical signaling  and visual signaling traits tracking habitat diversification through time  We suggest that the evolution of chemical signaling and dorsal marking traits is significantly impacted by ecological factors  Our results also suggest that visual signaling traits may function to reinforce the boundaries between ecologically distinct lineages in the C  maculatus complex  This study provides empirical support for an intricate relationship between ecological and signal evolution in speciation  one often ignored when these factors are studied in isolation  
Strong interspecific interactions help drive the evolution of life histories in the Trinidadian guppy  Populations of Trinidadian guppies  Poecilia reticulata  exhibit extensive  genetically based differences in life histories associated with the types of predators with which they co occur    Prior research has focused on the contrast between low predation environments  where guppies co occur with just the killifish Rivulus hartii  and high predation environments  where guppies co occur with Rivulus plus other species of predatory fishes   These differences in predation pressure are associated with other ecological factors  including physical characteristics of streams  primary productivity  and other aspects of the biotic communities   The life history differences between guppies from high  and low predation communities have long been attributed to the different risks of predation   However  while lowered predation risk at higher elevations is necessary for the low predation life history to evolve  it is not sufficient   There are three additional hypotheses for this evolution  all of which postulate some form of feedback from the ecological effects of guppies on their ecosystems to the selection gradients favoring the low predation life history   Here we present evidence for one of them  that strong pairwise interactions of guppies with Rivulus create selection pressures that facilitate the evolution of the low predation life history   We show from a field introduction experiment that guppies decrease Rivulus population density and alter the size structure of Rivulus populations   The magnitude of these effects is associated with changes in guppy population density and phenotype   We show from mesocosm experiments that in the presence of Rivulus drawn from locations in which guppies do not occur  guppies with the low predation phenotype have higher population growth rates than do guppies with the high predation phenotype   We also show that low predation guppies have higher population growth rates when paired with Rivulus drawn from locations in which the two species coexist than when they are paired with Rivulus drawn from locations where guppies do not occur   Taken together  these results indicate that strong ecological interactions between guppies and Rivulus create selection pressures that drive a coevolutionary feedback loop that contributes to the successful evolution of the low predation phenotype   
Using transcriptomes for functional phylogenomic studies  promises and pitfalls  Transcriptome sequencing provides a new path for cost effective genome scale functional analysis in non model species  Homolog and ortholog sets from housekeeping genes are rich resources for reconstructing phylogeny and mapping genome wide molecular rate shifts and genome duplications  In addition  the large number of homologs obtained from these data sets provide a rich resource for investigating candidate genes that may have contributed to adaptive changes  We discuss key methodological issues and misconceptions involving homology and orthology inference  evaluation of gene tree conflicts  and detection of shift in dN dS ratios  
Using the multi species allele frequency spectrum  msAFS  for next generation comparative phylogeography  Comparative phylogeography involves reconstructing the history of biological communities with population level genetic data collected from assemblages of species that presently co occur spatially  One of the long standing objectives of this discipline is to test hypotheses of shared demographic histories that may arise from climate shifts that might affect whole communities in order to gain understanding of large scale processes underlying regional patterns of biodiversity and community assembly   However  most studies to date have been limited to using mtDNA and a handful of nuclear loci  Now  next generation sequencing allows the potential to overcome this limitation to gain community scale inference at unprecedented resolution  yet aggregate data sets of such size bring analytical challenges   The allele frequency spectrum  AFS  has become a powerful way of characterizing population genomic data for demographic inference  and here we expand this into the multi species allele frequency spectrum  msAFS   This study describes how the msAFS is constructed over an arbitrary number of co occurring populations and subsequently investigates how it behaves under different simulated co expansion scenarios for 5 to 100 species with 25 000 SNPs from each species  By compressing the super matrix into the first two axes of a principle component analysis  we demonstrate that various alternative multi species histories can be discriminated with the msAFS  In addition  we utilized RAD tag data from three lake populations and two oceanic populations of the three spine stickleback  Gasterosteus aculeatus  to assess the applicability of the msAFS with empirical data   The msAFS will be suitable for using within a hierarchical modeling framework  allowing selection of co expansion models and hyperparameter estimation  i e  the variability of species specific parameters   This study is the first to explore methods for the analysis of multi species population genomic scale data  and as RAD seq protocols become routine for obtaining large scale SNP data from non model taxa  the msAFS opens the door for more powerful community level demographic inference for next generation comparative phylogeographic studies   Keywords  comparative phylogeography  population genomics  allele site frequency spectrum  co expansion  hierarchical modeling 
A Cross   species Study of Probabilistic Measures for Protein Amino Acid Codon Preference Given Structure Environment Using Residue Level Features  People have long been interested in studying the impact of protein structure on protein evolution  Here  we constructed probabilistic models for protein amino acid codon preference using high resolution protein structure data from humans and mice    We were interested in detecting differences between the models from these species because such differences could stem from differences in effective population size   In addition  we examined whether tertiary structure had correlations with codon preference beyond those that can be explained via the amino acid encoded by the codons  
Anchored Phylogenomics in Angiosperms  Maximizing Data Compatibility Through Coordinated Locus Selection  Targeted enrichment of DNA libraries prior to next generation sequencing permits the assembly of datasets with 100s or 1000s of putatively orthologous loci from across the genome for sophisticated species tree inference  A potentially transformative goal for the angiosperm phylogenomics community is agreement on a common set of target loci  since it would potentially remove the marker development step and maximize data combinability across studies  With collaborators we have identified and validated the candidate set of loci suitable for target enrichment across angiosperms   We began with the 959 genes previously identified by other researchers as apparently single copy in the genomes of Arabidopsis  poplar  grape  and rice  identified the corresponding exons in Arabidopsis  found that 3050 of the exons were above a threshold size necessary for enrichment  and narrowed these down further to 1721 exons that are ³55  similar between Arabidopsis and rice  Using these two taxa as a reference we then identified orthologous regions from 33 complete angiosperm genomes  representing the phylogenetic breadth of angiosperms  including Amborella  and nine low coverage genomes that we produced for non model angiosperms  499 of the exons had an average copy number ²1 2 and occurrence in ³85  of the genomes  The sequences for those 499 exons in 26 genomes were used to produce a custom Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit  We enriched genomic libraries for 50 angiosperms  representing orders from across the phylogeny  Poales  Brassicales  Dipsacales  Caryophyllales  Proteales  and Magnoliales   The kit had an average enrichment success of 93 6  of the targets across the 50 species  range   82 4 98 2    and the assembled locus length averaged 903 bases  range   428 2766  for the 50 species   Variability in the 499 target regions  the exons  with an average pairwise distance of 75 3   produced a phylogeny for 91 taxa  the 50 enriched species  the 33 angiosperms with complete genomes used in the earlier step  and nine non model angiosperm with low coverage genomes  that was broadly consistent with previously published whole plastid phylogenies when those agreed with previous functional nuclear phylogenomics results  but it echoed  mostly  the latter when the previous plastid and nuclear results did not agree   We will discuss utility of the flanking regions at shallow levels of the phylogeny in a second talk   
Disentangling phylogenetic relationships in an explosive bird radiation  Rapid evolutionary radiations allow tremendous insights into speciation and biogeographic history   However  a major challenge in studies of these brief bursts of diversification has been poor resolution of species  phylogenetic relationships owing to short internodes among ancestral lineages  incomplete lineage sorting  long branch attraction  and homoplasy   As a consequence  too few robust phylogenetic hypotheses are available to document such radiations   This study aims to resolve relationships within a very rapid and diverse radiation using both simulated and empirical data to illuminate underlying processes of lineage splitting and dispersal   The passerine family of white eyes  Zosteropidae  presents an ideal system for investigating one of the most striking evolutionary radiations known among vertebrates   The distribution of this group of 120 species spans a vast area in the Old World  from the eastern Atlantic to the Western Pacific  A vast majority of this lineage is estimated to have begun diversifying only in the early Pleistocene  resulting in the highest speciation rate yet documented among land vertebrates  The relatively recent diversification of this clade minimizes problems of long branch attraction and homoplasy confounding phylogenetic inference   Hence  this young and species rich group provides an excellent system in which to examine macro evolutionary and biogeographic patterns in rapid radiations  lines of research that depend on a robust estimate of phylogenetic relationships   Data from three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear introns yield a poorly resolved phylogeny  but simulations suggest that increasing the number of loci to  100 may improve resolution considerably   As predicted  DNA sequence data from hundreds of ultraconserved elements provide a much better resolved estimate of phylogenetic relationships in this rapid radiation  Resolution of phylogenetic relationships within Zosteropidae is vital to opening novel research avenues in historical biogeography and population genetics across several archipelagos and understanding the process of speciation in a species rich but morphologically conserved group   More broadly  this study provides methodological insights into paths toward resolving relationships in other rapid evolutionary radiations across the tree of life  
Rate of resistance evolution in long  and short lived hosts  Conventional wisdom suggests that adaptive evolution should occur more slowly in long lived organisms with long generation times than in short lived organisms  However  the opposite may be true for the evolution of disease resistance traits where the strength of the selection for resistance increases with longevity   We model evolution of resistance to a sterilizing disease and show that longer lived hosts evolve resistance over a greater range of conditions and do so more rapidly than short lived hosts   Our results may explain the low disease infection rates that have been observed in many long lived host species    
Structure and function of sites under positive selection  Selective pressure acting on a protein coding gene can be estimated by comparing the ratio of non synonymous substitutions per non synonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  dN dS    Values of dN dS larger than 1 are indicative of positive selection  whereas dN dS   Most analyses of selective constraint to date were conducted without regard for functional and structural characteristics or were limited to a small set of genes   Here  we attempt a global characterisation of selective pressures  taking into account the impact of structural and functional features   Using a method previously developed in the group  Sitewise Likelihood Ratio  we obtain estimates of selective constraint in the coding genome  9 million sites in total  in different mammalian species groups   These data indicate that the selective pressure on a site is strongly affected by structural features such as relative solvent accessibility and secondary structure   We also identify the pathways and domain types enriched in regions under positive selection   In addition to providing insight into the evolutionary history of mammals  these findings have implications for development of more powerful methods of detecting positive selection  
Holarctic biogeography of a widespread host symbiont association  Cophylogenetic analyses of host symbiont communities provide insight into the history of the association as well as patterns and processes of evolution within each taxonomic component  Unfortunately  challenges arise when a robust phylogeny or fossil evidence is lacking for either host or symbiont  In such cases  cross validation of host and symbiont phylogenies in a biogeographic framework may provide valuable resolution to coevolutionary patterns  Astacoidean crayfishes are ecologically important and highly visible components of freshwater habitats across much of the Holarctic  Despite numerous studies on astacoidean phylogeny  several deeper relationships remain unclear  Astacoidean crayfishes are host to a group of obligate ectosymbiotic clitellate annelids called branchiobdellidans  crayfish worms   The obligate nature of the symbiosis suggests a shared evolutionary history between host and symbiont  Our objective is to reconstruct cophylogenetic relationships of astacoidean crayfishes and branchiobdellidans to elucidate the evolutionary history of both host and symbiont  as well as the evolutionary history of the symbiosis  We used a supermatrix approach incorporating publicly available data and fossil evidence to estimate a time calibrated crayfish phylogeny  and a combination of four genes  COI  16S  28S  and 18S  and transcriptome data to reconstruct the branchiobdellidan phylogeny  We employed maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods  Lagrange  BioGeoBears  to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the crayfish and approximate Bayesian computation  Coala  to infer the coevolutionary history of the crayfish branchiobdellidan symbiosis  Preliminary results show that our well supported branchiobdellidan phylogeny provides valuable insight to the biogeography of their crayfish hosts  
 Selfing  Local Mate Competition  and Reinforcement   Due to local mate competition  highly selfing plant species often evolve to produce less pollen  and thus lower pollen ovule ratios  than related outcrossing species   If the two species share floral visitors  there is the potential for gene flow between the two species   Under these conditions  intuition suggests that gene flow from the selfer to the outcrosser may favor the evolution of increased pre zygotic isolation in the outcrosser  i e  the evolution of reinforcement   This expectation arises because the offspring of a cross between an outcrosser and a selfer will produce less pollen  and thus have reduced male fitness  compared to the offspring of a cross between two outcrossers    I present the results from analyzing a four locus diploid model of this process in which prior selfing prevents gene flow from the outcrosser to the selfer   The model indicates that reinforcement can evolve  but only under a restricted set of conditions that include   1  discrimination against selfer pollen must be caused by mutations of large effect and substantial dominance  and  2  alleles causing reduced pollen production must exhibit some degree of dominance   In addition  for a given level of gene flow  there is a threshold value of pollen production by selfers above which reinforcing selection will not occur  
Phylogenomics shows multiple human infectious lineages of Trypanosoma brucei  Using whole genome sequencing from 39 T  brucei strains  we construct the first comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the group based on over 750 sequence loci  totalling over 37kb in data  This analysis shows that multiple lineages of T  brucei are human infective  conclusively demonstrtating that the current taxonomy of the group does not reflect its evolutionary history  It also confirms the critical role that horizontal transfer of the Serum Resistance Associated  SRA  plays in the generation of human infective T  brucei strains  and that all circulating strains of T  brucei have the potential to become infective to humans   
Phenotypic shifts in urban areas in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus  Urbanization is an important dimension of global change and human dominated landscapes are increasing in both spatial extent and intensity worldwide  How populations of urban persistent species might be adapting to these habitats is a topic of interest to evolutionary biology and conservation  We studied populations of a common neotropical lizard  Anolis cristatellus  in paired urban and natural habitats in three of the most populous regions of Puerto Rico to test the hypothesis that populations are adapting to urban conditions  We found significant evidence of a morphological shift in urban areas in this species  We are presently using a common garden rearing experiment combined with natural selection studies in the wild to help determine if this shift is genetically based and in the direction predicted by differences in natural selection between environments  
Evolution of weed phenotypes in radish  Agricultural fields are an atypical habitat for most plants  and adaptation to such an environment generally requires plants to grow  flower and set fruit quickly or risk being tilled under  We use the genus Raphanus  radish  to understand which traits influence the success of weedy populations  and how those traits have evolved  We analyzed multiple subspecies  crop cultivars and geographically distinct weeds from Raphanus ssp  populations from around the world at neutral genetic markers to determine population structure  and also performed several large common garden experiments  Our analysis suggests that weedy radish has evolved from non weedy ancestors  which would have had extremely low fitness in an agricultural setting  We are now taking a genome scan approach to look for signatures of selection in several weed populations  
Sequential speciation multiplicitively amplifies biodiversity across trophic levels  Diversity can beget diversity when speciation by one organism drives diversification of associated organisms in adjacent trophic levels  If organisms diverge and create new niches for others to exploit and catalyze a chain reaction of sequential speciation events  it is important to know the  1  frequency of such events in nature and  2  barriers to gene flow evolving between diverging populations that reinforce diversification  The apple maggot fly  Rhagoletis pomonella  Diptera  Tephritidae   is a classic example of sympatric speciation in action  Host races of hawthorn and apple flies and sibling species in the pomonella complex differ in eclosion timing  host odor preference and allele frequencies  Recently  the R  pomonella attacking parasitoid wasp  Diachasma alloeum  Hymenoptera  Braconidae   has undergone sequential speciation as a result of diversification of its fly host  Paralleling the flies  wasps exhibit differences in allele frequencies  eclosion timing  and odor preference  We tested the hypothesis that sequential speciation is not simply linearly  but multiplicatively  amplifying biodiversity across trophic levels in the remaining members of Rhagoletis attacking parasitoid community  Two additional parasitoid wasps  Diachasmimorpha mellea and Utetes canaliculatus  also exhibited differences in eclosion timing  host odor preference and allele frequencies between sympatric populations  Ecological and genetic evidence supports the hypothesis that allochronic isolation via eclosion timing and behavioral isolation via host odor discrimination contributes to host associated genetic structure in sympatry and is an important mechanism generating biodiversity and structuring parasitoid communities in this system  
RAD Seq based phylogenetics of New World oaks  Quercus L      The genus Quercus  oaks  of North and Central America comprise the majority of oak global diversity  however relationships within and among the taxonomic sections and series remain poorly understood  Here we utilize genomic scale DNA sequence data  RAD Seq  to infer the relationships among the New World oaks  leveraging the most species  and nucleotide rich dataset to date  Sequence data was collected for 287 individuals  homologous loci across individuals were identified via clustering algorithm  and maximum likelihood estimates of phylogenies were produced  When concatenated  3252671 sites  174373 parsimony informative sites   these data provide a robust estimate of the deep splits among the major clades of North American oaks  largely validating previous treatments  but also revealing some novel relationships  Clustering at differing percentage similarity thresholds within loci produced largely concordant trees  with differences within each estimate due to anomalous placement of poorly sequenced individuals  The phylogeny reveals a pattern of early branching northern clades  with parallel dispersals into Latin America for the two major clades  red  section Lobatae  and white oaks  section Quercus   We also find evidence for two distinct Holarctic radiations in the white oaks  With a framework of the phylogeny established  these data are being used to explore genomic signatures of hybridization in regional subclades by subsampling both taxa and loci  and employing methods that incorporate population level processes  such as lineage sorting and introgression  into models of sequence evolution  
Ants show distinct gut microbiome convergence at opposite ends of the trophic scale  Ants are among the worlds most abundant terrestrial animals  with dominant roles in many ecosystems  While known as symbiotic creatures  symbioses with bacteria have not been explored in a systematic fashion across this diverse group  Our research aims to uncover the drivers and implications of such associations  Through a combination of molecular screening and next generation sequencing  we have characterized microbial communities and symbiont distributions across ants from four geographic locations  spanning much of the family phylogeny and much of the trophic scale  We find notable convergence among ants from herbivorous and predatory ends of the food chain  with unrelated ants from the same trophic extremes harboring overlapping communities of specialized gut bacteria  Ants from distinct herbivore or predator groups seem to harbor taxon specific communities  suggesting impressively long term evolution between some host taxa and their gut bacteria  In summary  these trends reveal a great importance for diet and ecological niche in favoring the origin of specialized symbiotic associations  while also suggesting an importance for particular bacteria within such niches  Our findings  thereby implicate bacteria as substantial players in the evolution of some ants  Yet the lack of such specialized associations across many ant groups hints that such symbioses may be a defining feature at the very ends of the food chain  
The Role of Selection in the Rapid Evolution of Reproductive Genes  Are we using the correct null hypothesis   Male reproductive genes tend to have elevated levels of divergence among species  a pattern frequently attributed to strong sexual selection acting on these genes within species   We model the expected level of polymorphism and divergence for sperm protein genes evolving by post copulatory  pre zygotic fertility competition   We find that  in theory  both the equilibrium level of polymorphism at mutation selection balance  as well as the expected level of divergence between species  are functions of the harmonic mean number of mates per female  the greater the harmonic mean number of mates  the stronger the intensity of male male sperm competition   We compare the theoretically expected levels of polymorphism and divergence of sperm competition genes with the observed levels of polymorphism and divergence in 17 Drosophila melanogaster male reproductive protein genes   We find that the observed levels of elevated sequence variation for male reproductive genes are better explained by relaxed selection than by any of the adaptive hypotheses proposed to date   We argue that tests of specific adaptive hypotheses require more robust theoretical predictions and we propose such a method for discriminating among alternative hypotheses  
The evolution of host perception in parasitic plants of the Orobanchaceae          Parasitic plants of the Orobanchaceae attack crop species including grasses  grains  and legumes throughout the world  In sub Saharan Africa alone  they cause billions of dollars of annual economic losses  Parasitic plants germinate in response to strigolactones  which are hormones exuded from host roots  Karrikins are structurally similar compounds found in smoke that stimulate post fire germination in other plant species  Karrikins stimulate germination and strigolactones regulate plant architecture in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana  In A  thaliana the KAI2 and D14 proteins are putative receptors for karrikins and strigolactones  respectively  kai2 mutants have increased seed dormancy  no germination response to karrikin  and decreased light sensitivity  d14 mutants germinate normally but have increased axillary branching  consistent with strigolactone insensitivity              It is not known how parasitic plants perceive strigolactones  but this knowledge could result in the development of new strategies to control parasitic weeds  We hypothesized that D14 or KAI2 is involved in the germination response of parasites to strigolactones  To address this hypothesis  we have combined molecular evolutionary and functional analyses  We found that KAI2 has undergone gene duplication in parasitic plants  We performed phylogeny based selection tests and found that parasite KAI2 orthologs belong to three clades with three different rates of evolution  In members of the fastest evolving clade  we found evidence of positive selection on three amino acid residues predicted to contribute to ligand specificity  We transformed A  thaliana kai2 mutants with KAI2 orthologs from parasitic plants  Slow evolving parasite KAI2 orthologs rescue the Atkai2 seedling light sensitivity phenotype  A parasite KAI2 ortholog with an intermediate rate of evolution confers a karrikin specific germination response  Fast evolving parasite KAI2 orthologs confer a strigolactone specific germination responses  These data suggest that slower evolving parasite KAI2 orthologs may retain evolutionarily conserved roles in light sensitivity and perception of karrikin like compounds  while faster evolving orthologs may have adapted to sense host derived germination cues  
 Clade dynamics in size shape space  Diversity  duration  and extinction risk   Members of a clade are not randomly distributed in morphospace   a multi dimensional space constructed using morphological traits  Previous studies on various biological systems have shown that the species richness and evolutionary durations of subclades can vary with position in morphospace  However  mechanisms behind these patterns are poorly understood  Here  we investigate the patterns of morphospace occupancy in a macroecological macroevolutionary model system  the marine bivalves  to elucidate the underlying mechanisms  For each bivalve family separately  we defined the center of a simple morphospace based on shell size and shape  and examined the composition of the species assemblages in central versus peripheral zones of family morphospaces to test three hypotheses  1  Species belonging to species rich genera are more concentrated near the center than expected by chance  leaving the species from species poor genera mostly at the periphery  2  Species belonging to older genera are more concentrated near the center than expected by chance  leaving the species from young genera mostly at the periphery  To investigate the link between morphospace occupancy and extinction as a possible mechanism for hypotheses 1  and 2   we use geographic range size as an indicator of extinction risk  and test the hypothesis that 3  geographically widespread species are more concentrated near the center than expected by chance   Our results support all three of our hypotheses  suggesting that the center of a family s morphospace represents a location where diversity is maximized  most likely because of lower extinction rates  However  within the most diverse living family  Veneridae   where we have the morphologies of the earliest fossil member of each living genus  n   51   genera did not move through morphospace in a manner suggesting that the center of the morphospace is an adaptive peak or evolutionary attractor at the species level  Therefore  the apparent preference for the central morphospace does not appear to be the outcome of the dynamics  or trajectory  of morphospace occupancy within individual genera  but seems to be a product of differential survivorship among species and genera  e g  clade level effects of geographic range or species richness   
Plasticity in offspring growth maximizes potential fitness in unpredictable environments  In ideal conditions postnatal growth should be limited primarily by the ability of tissues to differentiate because suboptimal growth due to resource limitation can have immediate and long term consequences for fitness  However  conditions rarely are ideal and growth rate often exhibits considerable variation from the optimum  Passerines are a large and diverse group of animals that maximize postnatal growth to the rate at which skeletal tissue can differentiate  By maximizing growth rates  parents increase the number of possible nesting attempts per season and hence the total number of offspring they can produce  but limit the variation in nestling growth strategies  I analyzed growth rates for more than 5 000 nestlings in three populations of a multi brooded songbird  the house sparrow Passer domesticus  over 32 years  2 901 nestlings from 1975 1978 in Kansas  2 047 nestlings from 1988 2013 in Illinois  and 257 nestlings from 2012 2013 in North Carolina   Growth rate shows substantial spatial and temporal variation  Despite this extensive variation  growth rate and nestling survival are highest in rural populations in Kansas and North Carolina  and are consistently low in a residential population in Illinois  Faster growth rates during cicada emergences in 1990  2002  and 2007 suggest that poor growth in Illinois is caused by limited food availability  However  growth in these superabundant food years never exceeded the maximal rate seen in Kansas birds  These results show that house sparrows maintain considerable plasticity in offspring growth strategies  and support the assertion that growth rate may be limited in some populations and years by the ability of tissues to differentiate  Plasticity in postnatal growth likely enables parents to maximize fitness in unpredictable food environments and may have facilitated the rapid expansion of house sparrows across North and Central America  as well as the successful colonization of house sparrows in diverse environments around the world  
 Assessing eco evolutionary feedbacks among pea aphids  defensive symbionts  and natural enemies   The microbiome can significantly impact eukaryotic phenotypes and serve as an additional source of heritable genetic variation  While patterns across eukaryotes are consistent with a role for symbiotic microbes in host macroevolution  few studies have examined symbiont driven host evolution or the ecological implications across short timescales  In this study we report seasonal shifts in the frequencies of heritable defensive bacteria from the pea aphid  Acyrthosiphon pisum  across two host races and geographic regions  These shifts were consistent with symbiont responses to host level selection and  indeed  findings from one population suggested symbiont driven adaptation to seasonally changing parasitoid pressures  Conversely  symbiont levels seemed to influence enemy success when measured across host races  revealing ecological impacts of microbiome divergence  But overall the lack of clear patterns for several symbionts suggests disruption of symbiont driven host enemy dynamics  a finding of broad significance given the widespread nature of defensive microbes across plants and animals  
The dynamics of autotetraploid formation in Arabidopsis arenosa  Whole genome duplication  WGD   which results in polyploidy  is a significant evolutionary force throughout the tree of life  but is curiously common in plants  Understanding the evolutionary relationships between polyploids and their diploid progenitors can give us important insights into the dynamics of polyploid formation  establishment  and the generation of biological diversity  We focus on autopolyploids  which contain duplicated but equally homologous chromosomes  This chromosome duplication allows for greater intra individual allelic diversity and potentially larger effective population sizes  Demographic analyses can help us address how polyploid formation varies across the landscape of potential diploid progenitors and how it alters the evolutionary trajectory of species  We investigate the dynamics of autotetraploid formation and evolution in Arabidopsis arenosa  a close relative of A  thaliana and a new model for molecular understanding of polyploidy  We performed demographic analyses using coalescent based models on three genomic datasets that have different yet complementary ascertainment biases   1  Restriction Associated DNA sequencing  RADseq    2  whole genome sequencing of pooled samples  and  3  individual whole genome sequencing  Although the separate datasets yield different interpretations for some details of population history  all analyses agree that particular diploid gene pools preferentially contribute to autotetraploid diversity  suggesting frequent polyploid formation events and or interploidy gene flow from specific diploid genotypes  Moreover  our analyses show some autotetraploid lineages exhibit altered patterns of purifying selection and have experienced relatively recent  rapid demographic expansions and colonization of new niches  
Museum specimens illuminate paraphyly within the Asiatic striped squirrels  genus Tamiops    The Asiatic striped squirrels of the genus Tamiops belong to a highly diverse group of sciurids in the subfamily Nannosciurinae with over 60 recognized species  This genus is composed of small striped arboreal squirrels that are widely distributed across SE Asia and occupy a diversity of habitats from lowland to montane forests  up to 4 000 meters in the Himalayan mountains   Four species are currently recognized in the genus  T  mcclellandii  T  rodolphii  T  swinhoei and T  maritimus   although recent molecular work revealed that six populations within the T  swinhoei maritimus species complex were highly differentiated and may represent different species  In this study  we generated a phylogeny using whole mitochondrial genomes for representative populations from all four species of Tamiops from museum specimens  Our results revealed that the remaining two species  T  mcclellandii and T  rodolphii  were also paraphyletic in our analyses   No currently recognized species in the genus formed a monophyletic group   This is in agreement with previous research that found incongruent phylogenies generated from autosomal versus mitochondrial genes  Our data is thus compatible with the hypothesis that historical mitochondrial introgression events generated this pattern throughout the genus   However  the timing of these events remained unresolved and in this study we combined both mitogenomic and morphological data to attempt to clarify the species boundaries in all species of Tamiops  We used the program BEAST to date the mitochondrial divergence between and within species  Additionally  morphological measurements and pelage characteristics were studied in 140 museum specimens to evaluate if intermediate phenotypes occur  or if the incongruent mitochondrial lineages represent ancient introgression events  Our results indicate that the speciation process in this genus involved ancient mitochondrial capture introgression resulting in the pattern observed today  Additionally  nuclear DNA will be necessary to more clearly delineate species of Tamiops  drawing on a large number of samples from across each species  range   
Origin and evolution of Oceanic pelagic communities  In order to investigate the origin and evolution of communities of large pelagic predators in todays Oceans I generated megaphylogenies for three major fish groups  Scombriformes  Istiophoriformes  Clupeiformes  and dated the molecular trees using the rich fossil record of each of these groups  Together with previously available time calibrated trees of cetaceans  cephalopods and sharks  these new phylogenies reveal for the first time the pattern of origination and diversification of all the major groups of pelagic inhabitants of the worlds major Oceans  The result show two major bursts of origination and diversification  the first spanning the late Cretaceous Early Paleogene  in some cases slightly predating the KPg extinction events  and a second one spanning the Late Miocene Early Pliocene  The first burst of origination and diversification gave origin to many lineages that are currently assigned familial status  while the second episode saw the origin of most of the specific diversity of some of the largest pelagic predators  such as marlins and sailfishes  and tunas  I will discuss what factors may have been responsible for these two separate bursts of diversification in these clades  and how the radiation of these groups led to the present day diversity of pelagic communities 
Asymmetric host resources affect mycorrrhizal responses to host relatedness  Mycorrhizal colonization of soil and plant roots has been demonstrated to depend upon the relatedness of the group of plants  i e  whether they are siblings or strangers  However  the symmetry or asymmetry of resources available to each plant may also have important implications on the symbiosis  Since mycorrhizal hyphae connect neighbouring plants  an individual with less to give to the fungal partner could act as a freeloader and effectively cheat  by paying less carbon while still reaping benefits from its neighbour s contributions to the fungus  But kin selection should favour a well supported fungal partner even when siblings are experiencing asymmetric resource availability  Here we show that fungal responses to the relatedness of a pair of Plantago lanceolata plants depends on whether one plant  neither plant  or both plants are shaded  In particular  when shading was asymmetric  sibling pairs had greater fungal colonization than stranger pairs  These results indicate that siblings will cooperate to help their shaded neighbour but strangers will not   Thus plants can show altruism to relatives by maintaining a strong fungal network  
Deeply conserved r opsin phototransduction cascade genes may underlie a novel expansion response of chromatophores to light in isolated Octopus skin  Understanding the evolutionary origins of novel traits  whether morphology  physiology or behavior  sheds light on the processes that help shape the exuberant diversity we see in life  A key question is the extent to which novel behaviors depend on new underlying components or arise through evolutionary  tinkering   which may borrow and recombine existing components to produce new behaviors  Cephalopod mollusks like octopuses and squids dazzle prey  woo mates and seamlessly blend into the background by changing the color and pattern of their skin  Embedded in their skin are novel colored organs called chromatophores that they use to perform these astounding color changing feats  While changes in body patterning are known to rely on eyesight  we have also found that bright white light causes the chromatophores in isolated Octopus bimaculoides skin to expand in the absence of eye or CNS input  We call this behavior Light Activated Chromatophore Expansion or LACE  To identify potential molecular mechanisms that may underlie LACE  we found that r opsin phototransduction genes are expressed in octopus skin  and identified peripheral sensory neurons in the skin that express r opsin  LACE suggests that octopus skin is intrinsically sensitive to light  and that this dispersed light sense could contribute to their unique and novel camouflage abilities  Further  finding r opsin phototransduction cascade genes expressed in octopus skin suggests that a common molecular mechanism for light detection in eyes may underlie LACE and may have thus been co opted for light sensing in octopus skin  
 Gene flow and local adaptation at the lower elevation range limit of the montane salamander  Plethodon ouachitae   Many species range limits appear to be stable  even when occurring along gradual environmental gradients  A widely discussed but under tested hypothesis is that asymmetric migration from the densely populated range center to the sparsely populated periphery limits potential for local adaption at the range edge as alleles with the highest average reproductive success across the range get fixed even though these genotypes are poorly adapted to conditions on the periphery  We are testing predictions of this hypothesis in the terrestrial salamander  Plethodon ouachitae  which occurs at higher elevations on six mountains in the Ouachita Mountains  To quantify gene flow  we sampled 100 individuals across four elevation transects that descend the north slope of Winding Stair Mountain  analyzed one mitochondrial  three anonymous nuclear  and eight microsatellite loci  We measured local adaptation to abiotic conditions through closed system respirometry  which resulted in multiple measures of standard metabolic rate at temperatures spanning 5 30¼C for individuals collected at the highest and lowest elevation populations along two transects  Preliminary results using Migrate N shows little difference in effective population size within transects and high levels of gene flow in both directions  Additionally populations within all but one transect showed little to no genetic differentiation  However  we found significant differences in thermal sensitivity of standard metabolic rate between salamanders from high and low elevations on one of two transects based on a mixed model regression analysis  Salamanders collected from the highest elevation displayed thermal depression at high temperatures with metabolic rate plateauing  while those collected from the lower elevation point followed a linear increase in metabolic rate with increased temperature  Future work will examine additional transects increase sampling resolution at mid elevations and expand the metabolic rate sampling to more transects and test temperatures   
Joint effects of pollen limitation and pollen competition on offspring quality in a wind pollinated herb  Pollination intensity regulates both seed set and offspring quality  with pollen limited plants producing fewer seeds and progeny produced under high pollen loads and thus intense pollen competition expressing potentially better genotypes  Moreover  low seed production may result in larger seeds due to size number tradeoffs  Surprisingly  however  these links between pollen competition and pollen limitation have seldom been made  We measured several components of fitness for progeny produced by females of the wind pollinated dioecious plant Mercurialis annua under different levels of pollen limitation and thus pollen competition  Specifically  we tested the effect of pollination intensity on offspring performance in a design that allowed us to distinguish genetic and seed size effects on offspring quality  We found that pollination intensity and maternal effects significantly affected offspring performance  Most of the first seedlings to emerge has been sired under high pollen loads  Pollen limited mothers produced larger seeds  and larger seeds enjoyed growth advantages over smaller ones after emergence   We also found significant genetic and maternal effects on reproductive effort that depended on the competitive environment  Our results illustrate for the first time the contrasting genetic and maternal effects of pollen limitation on offspring quality   
Estimating gene flow directionality and demography of western Atlantic Syngnathidae with population genomic RADseq data  Powerful ocean currents and historical climatic fluctuations play a significant role in the diversification and population connectivity of coastal fishes  However  the impact of these abiotic forces cannot be decoupled from life history traits  including early stages of larval development or adult biology traits such as swimming capacity and zonation preference  One often over looked trait is the ability of species to raft on floating mats of vegetation  specifically Sargassum spp  shown to be a as a significant determinate for successful long distance dispersal in the Atlantic  Seahorses  Hippocampus  and pipefish  Syngnathus  are direct developers and relatively poor swimmers  though some species exhibit substantial connectivity across regional distributions  partially attributed to their rafting ability  Rafting is passive and therefore gene flow between populations is predicted to follow directional ocean currents  whereas climactic driven changes in available habitat could result in a history of divergence and genomic admixture that is incongruent with oceanic currents  To test the relative contribution of these two processes  we use RADseq from five co distributed species of western Atlantic Syngnathids and estimate gene flow directionality and magnitude between regional populations    Keywords  population genomics  RADseq  gene flow  ocean currents  fishes  seahorse and pipefish  Syngnathidae  
Coexistence of sexual and asexual reproduction in the wild mustard Boechera retrofracta  Evolutionary theory predicts that sexual and asexual reproduction should not coexist  Yet apomixis  asexual reproduction via seed  is widespread  co occurring with sexual reproduction in hundreds of flowering plant genera from numerous families  In nearly all of these groups  apomixis is strictly associated with hybridization and polyploidy  However  in the perennial mustard species Boechera retrofracta  diploid and polyploid apomixis co occurs with sexual reproduction within multiple populations  What evolutionary and ecological factors permit asexual and sexual reproduction to coexist in these populations  We used a four garden reciprocal transplant to explore the hypothesis that selection may favor one reproductive mode over another  or vary spatially or temporally to maintain this polymorphism  We found no significant difference in fecundity between sexuals and asexuals  However  asexuals experience significantly higher levels of herbivory than sexually reproducing individuals  No evidence for spatially variable selection was found  We also examined the hypothesis that asexuality  tightly associated with hybridization in this largely self fertilizing genus  may be maintained by heterosis  Results from a greenhouse experiment comparing fitness of interspecific F2 hybrids and their self fertilized parents show that selfed individuals enjoy higher fitness in early life stages  but surviving hybrids have higher fecundity  Although all hybrids display fecundity higher than the mean of their progenitors  cumulative fitness deviates from this pattern in some hybrid lineages  These results suggest that asexual reproduction may be maintained by heterosis in this group  but that the effect strongly depends on the identity of hybrid parents  
MHC polymorphism and divergence in wild and domesticated zebra finches  The zebra finch  Taeniopygia guttata  is a passerine bird comprising two subspecies native to Australia and the Lesser Sunda Islands  respectively  Domesticated populations in the United States have also been derived from the two subspecies  The Lesser Sundas zebra finch appears to have gone through a severe genetic bottleneck during the colonization of the islands from Australia  Previous studies of domesticated zebra finches also show divergence between wild and captive populations at neutral genetic loci  Comparisons utilizing functional loci  however  are lacking  Here  we characterize the polymorphism and divergence in the third exon of the highly variable major histocompatability complex  MHC  class I   chain  which encodes the  2 domain of the peptide binding region  PBR   Immune genes are thought to strongly rely on genetic variation to convey a greater resistance to pathogens  Genes of the MHC  a component of the vertebrate adaptive immune response involved in antigen presentation  have received considerable attention in immunogenetic studies due to their importance in the immune response  Despite historical bottlenecks in nature and during domestication  high MHC polymorphism persists in all zebra finch populations  We report higher levels of nucleotide diversity when compared with neutral loci and strong evidence of positive selection acting on important residues forming the PBR  Due to its importance in pathogen recognition  selection seems to have maintained variability of the MHC class I  even following population bottlenecks  Although there is high genetic diversity in all populations  we do find evidence of genetic differentiation between zebra finch subspecies and between wild and domesticated zebra finches  both potentially representing adaptation to novel environments  
Dimorphic development in Streblospio benedicti  genetic analysis of morphological differences between larval types  The marine polychaete Streblospio benedicti exhibits two distinct larval types  making it a model for the study of developmental evolution  Females produce either large eggs or small ones  which develop into distinct lecithotrophic or planktotrophic larvae with concomitant morphological and life history differences  Here  we investigate the inheritance of key morphological traits that distinguish the larval types  We use genetic crosses to establish the influence of maternal and zygotic differences on larval phenotypes  We find a large maternal effect on larval size and the number of larval chaetae  while the number and length of these chaetae are also strongly influenced by zygotic genotype  Interestingly  the distribution of larval phenotypes produced by these crosses suggests traits intermediate to the two parental types should not be uncommon  Yet  despite gene flow between the types in natural populations  such intermediates are rarely found in nature  suggesting that selection may be maintaining distinct larval modes  
Global Influenza A H3N2 Migration under Changing Prevalence throughout the Year  Influenza A H3N2 is a highly seasonal  single stranded  segmented RNA virus that has been circulating in the human population since 1968 and is the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality  A fundamental question in the dynamics of seasonal H3N2 influenza is identifying the relationship between changing prevalence throughout the year and the level and timing of immigration and emigration of the virus between global communities  This question has remained elusive because we have lacked a methodological framework to address seasonal  as opposed to constant phylogeographic migration rates  Here  we build and expand upon recently developed methods to infer migration rates which differ from season to season  and to calculate the expected number of migration events between global communities throughout the year  Our results reveal clear patterns of seasonal migration within regions and globally  with rapid local turnover and windows of immigration and emigration mapping to epidemic spread and decline respectively  At a global level  strain persistence  as manifested through the trunk of the phylogenetic tree of H3N2  is strongly correlated with reduced seasonal variability in incidence within the global communities which were examined  One main implication is that the current emphasis on connectivity  including air travel  should be complemented with a better understating of the conditions and timing required for the successful establishment of migrants  Our approach provides a basis to better understand seasonal drivers  to expand prediction horizons and to improve vaccine updating by identifying strains that not only escape immunity but also have the seasonal opportunity to establish themselves  In addition  our inference framework can inform the study of seasonal phylogeographic migration patterns in other pathogens and in microbes in general  
 Experimental removal of parental care leads to the evolution of reduced offspring dependence in the burying beetle  Nicrophorus vespilloides   Parents of many species provision their young after hatching or birth   Such provisioning is an important component of parental care that simultaneously influences the phenotype of offspring and the selective environment they experience   While there is considerable direct evidence that parents infleunce offspring phenotype  the evidence that offspring adapt to varaition in the level or form of parental care is less direct   We used experimental evolution to examine how populaitons of the burying beetle  Nicrophorus vespilloides  adapt to the complete removal of post hatching parental care   We found that adaptation to the removal of post hathcing parental care involved rapid changes in larval survival in the absence of care   Other measures of larval performence  such as the ability of larvae to consume a breeding carcass and larval mass at dispersal did not differ consistently between lines that had evolved with or without care  
Accelerated molecular evolution in brood parasitic finches  demography or selection   Indigobirds  Vidua sp   are host specific brood parasites that have become an important model for the study of speciation   Speciation in indigobirds has been driven by the colonization of new hosts  this process likely has resulted in repeated bottlenecks over the history of host shifts in this group   Furthermore  brood parasitic species are generally less abundant than their hosts   These aspects of indigobird natural history should lead to a decreased effective population size  Ne  and therefore  a higher rate of fixation of nonsynymous substitutions     in indigobirds relative to non parasitic species   Indeed  Sorenson and Payne  2005  found support for this using 505 codons of the mitochondrial ND2 and ND6 genes  and this effect is also seen across the entire mitochondrial genome   Here we test whether this pattern of rate acceleration also spans the nuclear encoded portion of the genome   To do so  we sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of a male indigobird Vidua chalybeata   The transcriptome was sequenced from multiple tissues  brain  testes  liver  and the Illumina platform   Transcripts were assembled in Trinity and yielded a putative ortholog set of over 10 540 genes   We used Phylogenetic Analysis using Maximum Likelihood  PAML  to compare rates of evolution in the indiogbird lineage relative to transcriptomes of three non parasitic species   zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata  song sparrow Melospiza melodia and white crowned sparrow Zonotrichia leucophrys   The finding of an accelerated rate of evolution throughout the indigobird genome would support the hypothesis that small effective population sizes have caused the accelerated molecular evolutionary rates in these parasitic species   Alternatively  if the rate acceleration is restricted to the mtDNA  that could suggest selection acting specifically on female lineages  perhaps in the context of selection on genes associated with the evolution of host mimicry by parasites  
Behavioral Diversity in Malawi African Cichlid Fishes  The adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Malawi has resulted in a species flock that is ideal for studying diversity among many phenotypically divergent but closely related species in a natural context  wild derived cichlid fish can be examined in a controlled laboratory setting  while interpretations of results can be informed by ecological studies   Because of this unique feature  laboratory lines of African cichlids can be used to examine the genetic basis of a variety of morphological and ecologically relevant phenotypes  including fundamental differences in how species use and investigate their environment  In order to identify behavioral differences between cichlid species  I modified classical behavior tests to quantify individual responses to novel environments  objects  and individuals in five wild derived cichlid lines representing two genera  Four sister species of the rock dwelling genus Metriaclima were used to provide a picture of the behavioral differences between recently diverged lineages  and were compared to Aulonocara baenchi for more distant evolutionary context  Recorded videos of each assay were analyzed with computer software to generate measures of movement  such as speed  and exploration  such as number of approaches to a novel object   Preliminary findings suggest that both open field speed and novel object investigation differs by species  providing exciting prospects for future genetic studies   
Does separation between sexual organs affect mating   A case study from the alpine primrose Primula halleri  Bankground  Floral design profoundly affects reproductive strategies  In self compatible plants  variation in the distance between sexual organs  either within or between individuals  can enable a mixed mating strategy  The ability to reproduce via both outcrossing and selfing is thought to be beneficial for reproductive success and species survival under variable ecological conditions  such as those experienced by alpine plants  In the alpine  self compatible Primula halleri  anther stigma separation  herkogamy  decreases during floral development and differs between the mature flowers of distinct individuals  We investigate the relationship between herkogamy and mating system by comparing outcrossing rates among plants with different herkogamy levels in mature flowers  Methods  Levels of separation between male and female sexual organs of mature flowers were measured in the field for four populations of P  halleri from Switzerland by assigning each plant to one of two herkogamy classes  0 1 mm or >1 mm  Eleven microsatellite loci were used to estimate outcrossing rates with both population structure and progeny array approaches  The latter also allowed us to infer individual level outcrossing rates  Finally  we statistically compared outcrossing rates among plants with different herkogamy levels  Results  At the population level  outcrossing rates  t  range from 0 690 to 0 750  based on the population structure approach  and from 0 684 to 0 718  based on the progeny array approach  At the individual level  multilocus outcrossing rates  tm  range from 0 017 to 1 across all populations  with values of 0 017 to 1 in the low herkogamy group  0 1 mm  and 0 462 to 1 in the high herkogamy group  >1 mm   Three out of four populations show significantly broader variation of outcrossing rate in the low herkogamy group compared to the high herkogamy group  Conclusions  The results show that all studied populations exhibit intermediate outcrossing rates  0 2 P  halleri  The low herkogamy group has more individuals with low outcrossing rates  tm  
Sex Chromosome Dosage Compensation in Heliconius butterflies  Dosage compensation is the equalization of gene expression levels in response to differences in gene dose or copy number   It is classically considered to play a critical role in the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes  As the X and Y diverge through degradation and gene loss on the Y  or the W in female heterogametic ZW taxa   it is expected that dosage compensation will evolve to correct for sex specific differences in gene dose  Although this is typically observed in male heterogametic  XY  species  recent genome wide expression studies in other taxa have revealed striking exceptions  especially in ZW taxa such as birds and snakes   In these taxa  the single Z of females is under expressed relative to males  These results fuel speculation that incomplete dosage compensation may be a defining characteristic of female heterogamety   However  Lepidoptera  moths and butterflies  are also female heterogametic  and evidence is accumulating that at least some moth species show balanced expression between sexes on the Z chromosome  contradicting the emerging consensus that ZW taxa lack complete dosage compensation   We report the first genomic assessment of sex chromosome dosage compensation in butterflies  focusing on the genus Heliconius   Our results show that Z chromosome global expression is significantly lower than autosomes in both sexes  similar to previous reports in Silkmoth  and suggesting a novel mechanism of dosage compensation may exist in the Lepidoptera   We additionally detect a significantly greater global Z expression in males over females  indicating dosage compensation is imperfect in this species   However  the magnitude of this dosage effect is much less than the magnitude of reduced Z expression in both sexes   Methodologically  we introduce mixed model linear regression with a poisson error structure as a useful statistical framework for assessing sex chromosome dosage compensation  
Shade avoidance and Brassica rapa leaf development  Bayesian modeling and QTL analysis allows for predicting phenotypes from genotypes  Leaves perform the crucial task of photosynthesis  therefor we examined the morphological development of leaves throughout ontogeny in an experimental segregating population of B rapa  RILs   RILs were grown in crowded and uncrowded conditions over multiple years  and leaf length and width data were collected throughout ontogeny  We generated Bayesian models of leaf development and use parameters of these models in quantitative genetic analyses to demonstrate that crowding affects leaf development  and that developmental patterns are correlated with photosynthetic rate  plant architecture as measured by spectroradiometric readings  circadian rhythms  and fitness  To explore the g e interactions  model parameters describing leaf development were mapped to a high density linkage map of B  rapa  In addition to uncovering significant g e  this study highlights the importance of an ontogentic approach for understanding the genetic and environmental components of leaf development  because different QTL underlie growth rate and final leaf size  When predicting phenotypes based on genotypes  final measures of leaf size do not reveal important aspects of leaf morphology  especially growth dynamics during early development when leaf based photosynthesis is particularly critical for carbon assimilation  
The evolution of bet hedging and phenotypic plasticity  In light of an uncertain future  organisms face a difficult trade off   They can either specialize on a single phenotype across a range of environments  hedge their bets by randomly choosing among a set of phenotypes  or invest in physiological machinery to adjust their phenotype plastically to the environment   Understanding the evolutionary relationship between these strategies remains a puzzle   Here  we present a simple model for the evolution of specialization  bet hedging  and plasticity that reveals how these strategies are fundamentally sensitive to how the fitness cost of sensing varies with plasticity   When costs accelerate as a function of plasticity  the level of plasticity depends on how fast costs change   In contrast  decelerating costs can lead to full adaptive plasticity  but only when initial conditions are right   The shape of the cost curve is almost certainly due to the genetic and metabolic network machinery underlying plastic traits  which means that certain networks are more likely than others to evolve adaptive plasticity  
Ecomorphological evolution in the Liolaemus darwinii species group  Squamata  Liolaemini   adaptive diversification to climatic niches  Patterns of diversification at the macroevolutionary level can be due to adaptation processes or simple random divergence  In turn  adaptive divergence can be driven by natural selection in response to ecological factors  In this work  we evaluated diversification models in the L  darwinii species group using comparative phylogenetic methods  We took seven morphometric measurements in males of 18 species and we obtained climatic data from georeferenced localities  First  we compared the fit of Brownian vs  adaptive models of diversification based on the morphological variation among species and a phylogeny for the group using the R packages  picante  and  geiger   Second  we evaluated the evolutionary correlation between the morphological variation and the climatic niches using a phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis with the R package  phytools   Third  we fitted Ornstein Uhlenbeck  OU  models of adaptive evolution to randomly evolving predictor  climatic  variables using the R script  slouch   Three morphometric traits showed phylogenetic signal and fitted a model of adaptive optima better than a Brownian model  Taking into account phylogeny  the morphological variation among species is highly and significantly correlated with the variation in climatic niches  OU models show that phylogenetic signal of several morphometic traits is the result of adaptive change to climatic variation instead of phylogenetic inertia  These results suggest that adaptive diversification in the L  darwinii group took place as a response to divergent climatic niches in the wide  latitudinal and altitudinal gradients of the Monte Desert in west central Argentina  
 The effect of herbicide resistance on mating system in the common morning glory  Ipomoea purpurea   Plant mating systems are labile and affected by various biotic and abiotic environmental conditions  Although modeling efforts suggest that the mating system can directly influence the evolution of herbicide resistance in nature  empirical examination of the relationship between resistance and variation in the mating system is absent in the literature  Here  we investigated populations of the common morning glory  Ipomoea purpurea  across the species  weedy range in the Midwest and Southeast of the United States to assess the relationship between mating system and resistance to glyphosate  which is the active ingredient in the widely used herbicide RoundUp  We examined resistance by performing population dose response screens and measured the neutral genetic diversity of progeny arrays across 23 field collected populations to determine if the mating system  outcrossing versus inbreeding  has been influenced by resistance evolution  or vice versa  across the species  range  We found a positive correlation between resistance and inbreeding  F   suggesting either demographic shifts from glyphosate use leading to greater self fertilization and sib mating in resistant populations than in susceptible populations  or evolutionary changes in the mating system as a result of resistance evolution  Additional temporal examination of mating system estimates  in particular of populations that increased in resistance level between 2003 and 2012  will aid to our understanding of how variation in the mating system is influenced by the process of resistance evolution  
Differential natural selection on codon usage among amino acids in Drosophila pseudoobscura   Like other species of Drosophila  D  pseudoobscura has a distinct bias toward the usage of C  and G ending codons   Codon bias differs among amino acids  and other codon classes  in Drosophila  which may reflect differences in the intensity of selection on codon usage   Ongoing natural selection on synonymous codon usage should be reflected by shifts in the site frequency spectra of derived states at polymorphic positions  with more pronounced shifts when the intensity of natural selection is increased  33 729 synonymous polymorphic sites on Chromosome 2 in D  pseudoobscura were analyzed  and shifts in the site frequency spectra are consistent with differential intensity of natural selection on codon usage   The shifts are more pronounced for polymorphic synonymous sites than for polymorphic intron sites  also consistent with natural selection  
Does sexual selection reinforce or impede responses to competitively mediated disruptive selection   When populations experience disruptive selection for resource use  females are generally expected to prefer mates of their own ecotype  By doing so  females are less likely to produce offspring of intermediate phenotypes that would be selectively disfavored  This pattern of mate choice should facilitate an evolutionary response to disruptive selection and thereby promote resource polymorphism within the population  Yet  in many populations  females exert directional condition dependent preferences for males  Such a pattern of sexual selection could actually inhibit a response to disruptive selection if females with these preferences produce intermediate offspring  Consequently  polymorphism would be reduced and disruptive selection enhanced  We experimentally evaluated these alternatives in spadefoot toads  which experience strong disruptive selection favoring alternative resource use morphs  Our results suggest how sexual selection affects adaptive evolution in response to competitively mediated disruptive selection    
Genetic population structure of Blanding s turtle  Emydoidea blandingii  in southeastern Wisconsin  The genetic population structure of Blanding s turtle  Emydoidea blandingii   a threatened species through much of its range  was examined in southeastern Wisconsin using nine microsatellite loci in three populations  N 35   A low but significant value of FST  0 05212  indicated low levels of population structure  Deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium within populations provided little evidence for within population structure  An M Ratio test for recent genetic bottlenecks in the populations under study showed low ratios of allelic diversity to allelic size ranges in two of three populations  indicating possible genetic bottlenecks  Genotype assignment tests indicated that all turtles were most likely from their source populations  Effective population sizes for all populations were similar and large  759 815   These data suggest that Blanding s turtle was once widely distributed in southeastern Wisconsin  but that recent habitat fragmentation and loss has contributed to a genetic bottleneck in the resulting subpopulations  
Population genetics and phylogeography of wild maize along environmental gradients   Wild maize or teosinte  Zea mays ssp  parviglumis and Zea mays ssp  mexicana are found in Mexico from altitudes ranging from 300 meters above sea level to almost 2600 m  growing in a wide range of climates  soils and surrounding vegetation  We  describe here the first results of an analysis of 41 wild populations  including data form chloroplast  mitochondria and nuclear genes  ISSRs  microsatellites and 33000 SNPs   along with detailed climatic and ecological analyses  Our results show that the overall genetic diversity in teosinte is high within most populations for nuclear markers  but some populations have only one chloroplast or mitochondrial haplotype  The analysis indicate very strong genetic structure for maternal markers  both chloroplast and mitochondria   in contrast  we found moderate differentiation with the nuclear genes  but clear patterns of local adaptation and a large number of candidate genes   The results suggest that local adaptation    in addition to geographic distance    are important drivers of differentiation among populations   The genetic structure found in our studied wild maize population in Mexico does not adjust to the standard classification of two subspecies  including several well defined geographical clades  It also throws some intriguing light on the areas and dates of the origin and domestication of maize that does not adjust to published models and literature  These results show the importance of using climatic and ecological analyses in addition to a large set genetic nuclear data  along with chloroplast and mitochondria information from big set of populations and individuals to understand the patterns of differentiation and the origin of new genetic groups   
Looking for evolutionary history of nematodes on the beach to better manage their populations in the fields  Heterodera schachtii and Heterodera betae are two cysts nematodes causing severe damages in sugar beet  Beta vulgaris subsp  vulgaris  crop every year  Several control methods exist but resistant varieties are often the most cost effective alternative to pesticides  New varieties are currently developed with genes associated with resistance coming from the wild relative species of cultivated beet  Beta vulgaris subsp  maritima  which is a suitable host plant for both nematodes species  Beta maritima recolonized the Atlantic coastline after the Last Glacial Maximum and wild nematode populations are thus supposed to have historically evolved on this wild host and to have recently being transferred to cultivated fields  This hypothesis has hitherto not been tested though it may have non negligible consequences on the management of nematode populations in crop fields  In this context  we developed a phylogeographical approach to  i  evaluate similarities between evolutionary histories of both nematodes and the wild beet at the European scale and  ii  to develop hypotheses on coevolution in the Heterodera schachtii Heterodera betae Beta vulgaris subsp  maritima complex  We carried out a hierarchical sampling scheme from southern Spain to northern Europe in order to investigate the occurrence  the ecological preferences  and the spatial structuring of nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic diversity of the three species  Interestingly  results suggest that those species have different ecological niches with different pattern of genetic structure even though they are co distributed  
Method to identify small scale gene transpositions in rearranged genomes   Duplications and transpositions leading to gene rearrangements are frequent in eukaryotic genomes  These regions of rearrangements are readily identified through comparative genomics  But inferring the ancestral state of the genome  and the history of transposition events are still a challenge  Different algorithms have been developed to infer the phylogeny using gene order data and various distance models based on the rearrangement events  As an alternative to those approaches  I show that we can infer small scale gene transposition events by mapping the gene positions onto the known phylogeny  The location of extant genes are mapped to a common map defined by conserved segments across species  Using a parsimonious reconstruction of gene locations  gene transpositions are identified within rearranged genomes  I applied the method to six primate genomes  and identified the genes that have transposed along the branches of the primate phylogeny  Since the method can be applied to species groups with moderate rearrangements  it will be useful in identifying gene transpositions among a wide range of taxa  
Exploring patterns of symbiont diversity in natural pea aphid populations  Symbioses that involve maternally transmitted bacteria have proven to be highly prevalent in the natural world and serve as important sources of adaptive novelty   Many of these symbionts are facultative  found at intermediate levels within host populations and confer unique host level phenotypes that favor both the host and bacterium under certain conditions   High levels of symbiont diversity in some host populations in nature are likely maintained by a heterogeneous environment over space and time   Understanding adaptive evolution will require identification of the environmental forces that shape symbiont   and by extension  phenotypic  variation in the wild  The pea aphid  Acyrthosiphon pisum  and its diverse microbiome serve as a model to study the dynamics and diversity of heritable symbiosis   All seven symbionts have been implicated  to some extent  in defense against natural enemies   Recent surveys reveal that the frequencies of these symbiont species differ in relation to host plant  geography and  to some extent  fluctuating natural enemy pressures   Yet multiple strain variants exist for several symbiont species  and the known variation in effects conferred by different strains  suggest a need to track symbiont genotype along with species prevalence   Toward this end we have begun to investigate the genetic variation of Hamiltonella defensa and its associated bacteriophage over several scales  spanning multiple years  regions  and host race populations   Our findings reveal variation in strain types across regions and  potentially  seasons  They also show non random associations between H  defensa bacteriophage strains and other co infecting species  suggesting the potential for symbiont symbiont mutualisms or beneficial effects of specific co infections at the host level  Finer scale tracking currently underway will allow us to correlate symbiont strain diversity with natural enemy pressure  providing unprecedented insight into the natural dynamics of defensive symbiosis   
Tainted resurrection  Metal pollution is linked with high juvenile mortality in Daphnia egg banks  The life history strategy of many taxa relies on long lasting resting stages to transit harsh conditions  Plants  insects  zooplankton  algae  and fungi  to name a few  all produce resting stage propagules capable of temporal dispersal  Some of these propagules can persist for decades or even centuries before hatching or germinating  A wealth of research has focused on the functioning and evolutionary importance of these propagule banks  however relatively little is known about the effects of the abiotic environment experienced during dormancy on this complex life history strategy  This study examines the developmental success of Daphnia hatched from resting eggs from several lakes and time periods experiencing varying levels of heavy metal contamination  I hatched a total of 274 animals from resting egg banks going as far back in time as the early 1900s to the present day   I found strong evidence of increased juvenile mortality in Daphnia hatching from sediments contaminated by heavy metals  Post hatching juvenile mortality ranged from 0  to 45   This trend emerges from analysis of three polluted lakes and three different Daphnia species  Animals from a reference lake that experienced limited metal contamination had the lowest mortality rates  The mechanisms driving this trend will require further study  Heavy metals could have affected the eggs via maternal effects or bioaccumulation or directly through years of exposure to metal contaminated sediments  Regardless of the specific mechanism  exposure to heavy metals may impose strong selection on Daphnia hatched from resting egg banks    
Uncovering venom neurotoxin gene family evolution from black widow and house spider genomes and transcriptomes  Venoms are key adaptations that have independently evolved in several diverse animal lineages largely to facilitate rapid prey capture   Most venoms contain a wide assortment of toxins aimed at disrupting the nervous and circulatory systems of injected victims   Across divergent animal lineages  venoms also show remarkable similarities in their constituent proteins  implying the convergent recruit of homologous proteins for venom expression  However  determining the molecular diversity of venoms and deciphering the relationships of venom and non venom proteins has been challenging  given the limited number of multi tissue transcriptomes and genomes available for neglected venomous taxa   This talk will present recently completed and preliminary evolutionary analyses of the black widow latrotoxin venom gene family  based on high throughput multi tissue transcriptomes from the Western black widow  Latrodectus hesperus   and the recently sequenced genome of its non hazardous close relative  the house spider  Parasteatoda tepidariorum    Previous work identified a single protein  alpha latrotoxin  as the agent responsible for the extreme neurotoxicity of black widow venom  whereas the three other known latrotoxin paralogs were shown to be invertebrate neurotoxins   Results from a deeply sequenced L  hesperus transcriptome indicates the expression of at least 20 divergent latrotoxin paralogs in this species  venom   Moreover  phylogenetic analyses of latrotoxins from the P  tepidariorum genome show an unexpectedly large set of paralogs with highly variable domain structure  but all are very distantly related to L  hesperus latrotoxins  confirming the rapid evolution of this toxin family  and explaining the distinctly potent venom of black widows  
Male driven evolution of self compatibility in diploid and polyploid Arabidopsis  Stebbins stated that evolution of self compatibility is a most frequent evolutionary transition in plants  and moreover  polyploid species tends to be self compatible  SC   However  he also suggested that polyploidy may retard adaptive evolution because additional duplicated copies could retain original function  Then  how could polyploid species become self compatible despite of duplicated S loci  We have studied the molecular basis of the self compatibility of the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica  which was derived from diploid self incompatible A  lyrata and A  halleri  as well as of the diploid A  thaliana  In the sporophytic self incompatibility system of Brassicaceae including Arabidopsis  the S locus harbors female specificity gene SRK  male specificity gene SCR SP11 and Smi small RNA regulating the dominance of SCR  Using crossing experiments  we showed that the female components of SI  including SRK  are still functional in many accessions  Because SCR gene is too polymorphic to design conserved PCR primers  we obtained anther transcriptome data by using the Ion Torrent next generation sequencer  We found that both of the duplicated SCR were non functional in A  kamchatica  Our compilation of empirical data demonstrated that the evolution of self compatibility tends to be derived from mutations in the male component in wild species including A  thaliana  in contrast to cultivated species  We conducted forward simulation studies by integrating molecular data such as mutational bias  and indeed found the pattern that male SC conferring mutations were more likely to be fixed than were female SC conferring mutations in a wide range of parameters  
Evolution and Biogeography of the Bignoniaceae  Insights into the origin of the Neotropical Flora  The history of present day patterns of species diversity has fascinated biogeographers and ecologists for a long time  Yet  the exact factors that have shaped current distribution patterns remain to be understood  The plant family Bignoniaceae represents a conspicuous component of Pantropical forests  being particularly diverse and abundant in the Neotropics  The Neotropical representatives of the Bignoniaceae are distributed across multiple lineages  providing important insights into the origin of Neotropical ecosystems  Representatives of the Bignoniaceae occur in most ecological zones and exhibit considerable diversity in reproductive and vegetative morphology  The ecological importance of this group  combined with its broad distribution and morphological diversity make this plant family an excellent model for investigating the history of Tropical ecosystems  in particular the Neotropics where this plant family is most abudant and diverse  Here  I use broad scale molecular phylogenetic data to investigate patterns of diversity across the Tropics  I then use fine scale phylogenetic data of selected lineages to investigate finer scale patterns of diversity within the Neotropics  Insights gained from ecological  morphological  genetic  biogeographic  paleontologic  and geologic data suggest that patterns of modern diversity have complex evolutionary histories  
The identification and characterization of a behavioral isolation gene   Behavioral divergence is thought to be among the earliest reproductive isolation barriers to develop during speciation  While genetic mapping has elucidated the genetic architecture underlying behavioral isolation  no individual genes have been identified  limiting our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that enable species to develop and remain discontinuous from one another  Here  I present the identification and characterization of a gene influencing species specific female preference behavior between two species of Drosophila  
Using disease data to inform models of protein evolution  A mutation that causes disease is likely to be selectively deleterious and is unlikely to persist over time   For some protein coding human genes  a large number of selectively deleterious mutations have been identified   We are interested in combining this information from disease data with interspecific sequence data   One reason for doing this is to improve our probabilistic models of protein coding DNA evolution   Another reason is to predict whether a mutation might cause disease   A modelling challenge arises when an amino acid type at a protein sequence position causes disease in one species but not in another   Two separate attempts to meet this challenge as well as some preliminary results will be discussed  
A simple biophysical model of protein binding DNA predicts higher rates of allopatric speciation in small populations  Speciation is fundamental to understanding the huge diversity of life on Earth  Evidence suggests reproductive isolation arises most commonly in allopatry with an increasing rate of speciation for small populations  Current theory does not address how the speciation rate varies with population size in the important weak mutation regime of evolution  In addition  increasing data suggest that many species differences involve a divergence in the regulation of gene expression and that a number of speciation genes involve transcription factors  Here  we address the underlying biophysical basis of speciation by using a simple model of transcription factor DNA binding and how their co evolution in two allopatric lines leads to incompatibilities  Surprisingly  we find this simple consideration leads to a new prediction for the monomorphic regime of evolution  that smaller populations should develop incompatibilities more quickly  We show this arises due to two factors  1  smaller populations have a greater initial fixed genetic load  due to the effect of sequence entropy  and so are closer to incompatible regions of phenotype space  2  for larger populations substitutions are no longer nearly neutral and the divergence between lineages slows down  These predictions are consistent with observations of large species diversity in small habitats such as Cichlids in the East African lakes  contrasted with the lower diversity of marine animals  which have large ranges and population sizes  
Using comparative transcriptomics and a whole genome to study the evolution of cold tolerance in stick insects  We have used comparative transcriptomics to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance across a phylogeny of stick insects from New Zealand  These species are found from subtropical northern forests to alpine areas  where they overwinter above the snow line  We investigate the prediction that related stick insect species use similar strategies to survive cold  We have built a phylogeny based on 274 conserved orthologous genes and used this as a phylogenetic framework  Using RNA sequencing  RNA seq  we then compared differentially expressed genes following cold shock recovery in different species  A large number of differentially expressed genes were not shared among species  We did however observe shared patterns of expression in structural cuticular genes across five species  Maximum likelihood selection texts inferred a number of genes under positive selection in alpine and lowland species  We also present a preliminary genome assembly of the New Zealand stick insect Clitarchus hookeri whose genome was estimated by flow cytometry to be approximately 4 5 Giga base pairs  Gb  in size  The current assembly was constructed using  4 7 and  2 6 billion Illumina paired end and mate pair short sequence reads  respectively  from libraries of various insert size  resulting in a genome assembly size of 4 3 Gb  Multiple programs including SOAPdenovo  GapCloser  SSPACE and AllpathLG were used in the whole assembly pipeline  which we are currently optimising based on a number of evaluation criteria  This genome will be used for further studies on adaptive evolution in New Zealand stick insects  
Relaxing the molecular clock to different degrees for different substitution types  Because point mutations can arise from a variety of molecular mechanisms  the change in substitution rate over time can differ among substitution types    To quantify this variation among substitution types and to improve divergence time estimation  we sample histories of homologous sequences according to their posterior distribution    These histories allow us to infer   branch lengths   for each combination of branch and substitution type on a phylogenetic tree    We can then examine the degree to which substitution types vary in their tendency to change rates   In addition  we can use this information to infer divergence times    A nice feature of the approach is that context dependent substitution  e g   CpG hotspots  can be accommodated  
Uncovering genome wide targets of convergent evolution along a re established flowering time cline in the introduced range of Arabidopsis thaliana  Rapid evolution in response to new environments is repeatable  at least at the phenotypic level  In cases of convergent evolution however  the question remains whether the same heritable components are the repeated targets of selection  Do new or rare  locally restricted alleles facilitate adaptation  or does standing genetic variation and widespread gene pleiotropy largely constrain evolution to the same pathways and alleles at the molecular level  We addressed this question by studying the ecological genetic basis of flowering time adaptation in introduced populations of Arabidopsis thaliana  Using outlier analyses and genome wide scans  we have identified variants associated with flowering time differences along a re established longitudinal cline in eastern North America  We compare these with variants with the genetic basis of flowering time adaptation in the native European range and discuss implications for the role of standing genetic variation in underpinning convergent phenotypic adaptation  particularly with regard to species introductions  
Natural variants of the gene Crystallin are associated with differential seasonal adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster  The worldwide expansion of Drosophila melanogaster from tropical areas of Africa to temperate regions has required adaptation to the pronounced seasonality in temperate habitats  Diapause was shown to be a derived life history strategy that D  melanogaster take to increase overwintering survivorship  hence adapt to the temperate climate  It is a genetically determined syndrome cued by shortened photoperiod and or reduced temperature that results in lifespan extension  delayed senescence  increased stress tolerance and reproductive quiescence  In natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster  the expression of diapause is highly variable  In our study of the transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of diapause and non diapause populations  the gene Crystallin  Cry   which is known to be a structural constituent of eyes  came out as one of the most differentially expressed genes  with low expression in diapause populations as compared to non diapause populations  this was consistent at both the mRNA and protein levels  In our search of seasonal genetic variants in natural populations  a SNP on the intronic region of Cry is found to oscillate in frequency among seasons consistently over 3 consecutive years  indicating that it is subject to strong  temporally variable selection  This SNP is trans specific in D  melanogaster and D  simulans  thus is likely to be under balancing selection before the two lineages diverged  To investigate the functional significance of this SNP in Cry  we constructed pairs of out bred populations with the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel  DGRP  lines that are know to carry one or the other allele at this specific site  such that the only difference between the populations is their allele state on this SNP and the background is randomized  Another pairs of populations are constructed with a matched control SNP in the same way  Diapause incidence under long and short day conditions demonstrated that the summer adapted allele is more responsive to photoperiod than the winter adapted allele  Furthermore  the alternative alleles are also shown to affect a subset of other traits genetically correlated with diapause expression  These effects were also confirmed with complementation tests  Our result indicates that the two alleles in Cry may contribute to seasonal adaptation through differential perception of light  This study represents a comprehensive evaluation of seasonal adaptation  from genome wide screens to the functional validation of identified genes and SNPs   
Evaluating the influences of polyploidy and reproductive mode on life history variation in a snail model for the maintenance of sex  Sexual reproduction is both extremely common and costly  suggesting that there are profound benefits associated with sex that can counter its costs  Here  we focus on potential life history costs and or benefits of sexual reproduction as well as of polyploidy  a trait commonly associated with asexual reproduction that itself may influence important life history traits  We used a common garden approach to address these questions  quantifying growth rate  time to reproductive maturity  and adult size in diploid sexual and triploid and tetraploid asexual Potamopyrgus antipodarum  This New Zealand freshwater snail is well suited for studying sex and ploidy level evolution because sexual diploids and asexual triploids and tetraploids are ecologically similar and coexist in nature  allowing us to use comparisons of sexuals to asexuals and of triploid to tetraploid asexuals to in part decouple the effects of sex from effects of ploidy elevation  We detected significant variation in growth rate  time to maturity  and size at reproduction within each of the three ploidy levels  revealing genetic variation for these important life history traits  We also found reproductive maturity is not achieved until  4mm in length  indicating a size threshold that must be met before reproduction  Furthermore  individuals that grew more rapidly also reproduced at a younger age  These tight associations between size  growth rate  and age at maturity highlight the likelihood that growth rate is an important fitness related trait in P  antipodarum   While sexual P  antipodarum grew more slowly and reproduced at a later age than the polyploid asexuals  there were no apparent life history differences between triploid and tetraploid asexuals  The latter result suggests that ploidy level differences per se do not explain the relatively slow growth and maturation of sexuals  but instead indicates that reproductive mode itself may directly or indirectly influence life history traits  Taken together  these data suggest that the sexual diploid P  antipodarum persist in natural populations in spite of substantial life history disadvantages  
 Love   Bugs    Exposure to parasites increases promiscuity in a freshwater snail   Under the Red Queen hypothesis  outcrossing can produce genetically variable progeny  which may be more resistant  on average  to locally adapted parasites   Mating with multiple partners may enhance this resistance by further increasing the genetic variation among offspring  We exposed Potamopyrgus antipodarum to the eggs of a sterilizing  trematode parasite and tested whether this altered mating behavior  We found that exposure to parasites increased the number of snail mating pairs and the total number of different mating partners for both males and females  Thus  our results suggest that  in host populations under parasite mediated selection  exposure to infective propagules increases the rate of mating and the number of mates  
Genomic patterns of selection on genes of aerobic respiratory pathways in vertebrates    Linking genomes to phenomes is one of the grand challenges of 21st century biology  Because the availability of ATP limits most cellular and physiological processes  organismal adaptations with even modest energetic demands should be influenced by the functional efficiency of cellular respiration  Signatures of natural selection on respiration genes may therefore reflect a significant role in the evolution of life history traits  organismal fitness and biodiversity  We investigated patterns of natural selection on component genes of the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in the genomes of mammals and fishes  Ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in coding regions of genes of respiratory pathways were compared to a set of non respiratory housekeeping genes  Results suggest that specific targets of selection are variable but many organismal adaptations are associated with inferred positive selection on genes of the respiratory pathways  
The Contribution of Rare and Common Variants to Standing Variation for Quantitative Traits in Capsella grandiflora  What are the evolutionary mechanisms that maintain quantitative trait variation  This is a fundamental question with implications for the genetic architecture of traits and the relevance of standing variation in the process of adaptation   In particular  the contributions of balancing selection to the maintenance of quantitative trait variation is unclear   Our dataset comprises 189 Capsella grandiflora individuals from one deme  ¹syn 0 012   sequenced with deep coverage  30 110X  and phenotyped for a number of ecologically relevant traits including nitrogen use efficiency  flowering time  and fertility   The population sample consists of largely unrelated outbred individuals  and is highly polymorphic with rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium between polymorphic sites  We conduct a Genome Wide Association Study to identify common alleles underlying quantitative trait variation  and ask whether patterns of variation in linked sites indicate the contributions of balancing selection or partial sweeps   
The evolutionary interplay between dispersal traits and habitat specialization  In spatially heterogeneous environments  patterns of gene flow have significant consequences for the evolution of specialization and phenotypic plasticity  Conversely  organisms that are restricted to patchy or isolated habitats will experience selection for local or more targeted dispersal  While the evolutionary interplay between dispersal traits and habitat specialization has been recognized in theory  few empirical studies have tested if these dynamics predict dispersal traits and habitat associations in natural systems  We tested the hypothesis that dispersal traits evolve in conjunction with habitat specialization in Lasthenia  Madieae  Asteraceae   a clade of herbaceous flowering plants that are widely distributed throughout the California Floristic Province of western North America  While many species of Lasthenia are broadly distributed throughout the region  others are endemic to geographically isolated ephemeral wetlands called vernal pools  Lasthenia seeds are predominantly wind and gravity dispersed  and vary substantially in fruit morphology and size as well as the presence absence and length of the pappus  a tuft of hairs or bristles attached to the end of the seed that aid in wind dispersal   We predicted that species that are restricted to vernal pools have fruit traits that promote local dispersal  while the  habitat generalists  have traits that enhance dispersal over longer distances  First  we obtained fruits from all species in the genus and measured a suite of traits  including fruit weight  fruit length and width dimensions  and pappus length  Correlated measures of fruit size and shape were converted into independent variables using principal components analysis  Next  we released all fruits into a controlled wind current in a wind tunnel  measured their flight distances  and identified the fruit morphological traits that best predicted flight distance using ANOVA  Finally  we used comparative methods to evaluate the degree to which the flight enhancing fruit traits evolved in conjunction with habitat affinity in Lasthenia  Results indicate that Lasthenia vernal pool specialists have smaller  shorter and wider fruits  as well as a drastically reduced  or absent  pappus  compared to their more widespread congeners  thus supporting the hypothesis that dispersal traits evolve in conjunction with habitat specialization   
Evolution of secondary woodiness in Hedyotis Oldenlandia complex  Rubiaceae  in Asia and the Pacific  Hedyotis Oldenlandia complex  ca  600 spp   lies within a primarily herbaceous tribe Spermacoceae of the fourth largest plant family  Rubiaceae  However  some of the members  eg  genera Hedyotis and Kadua etc  in the complex are characterized by their uniquely derived secondary woody habit  These secondary woody clades also exhibit high endemicity  a montane distribution with narrow altitudinal range and high species diversity compared to their wide ranging herbaceous sister lineages  This presentation will discuss the correlates of the secondary woodiness and differential rate of evolution and diversification between herbaceous and woody groups within Hedyotis Oldenlandia complex  
Ancient duplication of vomeronasal receptor class 1  V1R  genes in lemurs  Vomeronasal receptor genes have frequently been invoked as integral to the establishment and maintenance of species boundaries among mammals due to the elaborate one to one correspondence between semiochemical signals and neuronal sensory inputs   We report the most extensive sample of vomeronasal receptor class 1  V1R  sequences ever generated for a diverse yet phylogenetically coherent group of mammals  the tooth combed primates  suborder Strepsirrhini    Phylogenetic analysis confirms that we have intensively sampled from a single V1R subfamily  apparently unique to the strepsirrhine primates   We designate this subfamily as V1Rstrep   The subfamily retains extensive repertoires of gene copies that descend from an ancestral gene duplication that appears to have occurred prior to the diversification of all lemuriform primates excluding the basal genus Daubentonia  the aye aye   Comparison of the two clades reveals different amino acid compositions corresponding to the predicted ligand binding site and thus potentially to altered functional profiles between the two   In agreement with previous studies of the mouse lemur  genus  Microcebus   the majority of V1Rstrep gene copies appear to be intact and under strong positive selection  particularly within transmembrane regions  Finally  despite the surprisingly high number of gene copies identified by both Sanger and PacBio CCS methodologies  it is nonetheless probable that V1R diversity remains underestimated in these non model primates   
Comparing Patterns of Molecular Evolution in Nuclear Encoded Mitochondrial Genes in Sexual and Asexual Lineages of a New Zealand Freshwater Snail  Nuclear encoded mitochondrial  NEM  proteins directly interact with mitochondrial encoded  MT  proteins to form multi subunit enzymes necessary for mitochondrial function  The cooperative nature of NEM and MT proteins suggests that the genes that encode these proteins may coevolve and raises the question of how these cooperative relationships are maintained despite the fact that these two critical sets of genes are housed in two very different genomes  NEM and MT coevolution might itself be profoundly influenced by reproductive mode  sexual vs  asexual reproduction  because 1  NEM and MT genes are transmitted in complete linkage disequilibrium in asexuals but bi parental inheritance and recombination of nuclear genes breaks down NEM and MT gene linkage in sexuals  2  nuclear mutations may counter or compensate for harmful mtDNA mutations that often accumulate in asexuals at higher rates than related sexuals  and 3  the particularly tight coevolution between NEM and MT genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial enzymes in asexual vs  sexual lineages may reduce the potentially harmful effects of mutation accumulation  Here  we use Potamopyrgus antipodarum  a New Zealand freshwater snail  to address these possibilities  Potamopyrgus antipodarum is ideally suited for evaluating how reproductive mode influences coevolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genes because sexual and asexual P  antipodarum often coexist and compete in nature and because there have been multiple independent transitions to asexuality  allowing for direct comparisons between sexuals and asexuals without introducing potentially confounding effects of genetic background or source population  We are currently sequencing NEM genes in 26 asexual and nine sexual P  antipodarum lineages to compare patterns of molecular evolution in NEM genes and all 13 MT genes across reproductive modes  While data collection and analyses are ongoing  we have already detected polymorphisms at nucleotide sites at the NEM MT interface  suggesting the potential for compensatory evolution  Regardless of outcome  the data we are collecting will provide new insights into how reproductive mode influences patterns of molecular evolution in coevolving genes  and more broadly  how the lack of sex affects molecular evolution in the nuclear vs  the mitochondrial genome  
Interactions between behavioral thermoregulation and color change in pipevine swallowtail caterpillars  Battus philenor               Organisms can respond to environmental changes with plasticity in a wide variety of traits  from morphology to physiology to behavior  However  rather than being entirely independent  these different plastic phenotypic changes should influence each other s effectiveness and expression  We studied these interactions in the thermoregulation of Battus philenor  pipevine swallowtail  caterpillars  which can use behavior to avoid high temperatures  often leaving their host plant  but can also cool themselves via a slower  morphological change between black and red coloration  Using physical caterpillar models  we have shown that thermoregulatory behavior reduces the utility of color change  with the red color cooling models on a host plant  yet having no effect when the model is on a thermal refuge  Nevertheless  using field enclosures of live caterpillars  we have shown that being red does reduce how often caterpillars must leave their host to stay cool  These results suggest that the main benefit of color change is not increasing the caterpillar s overall ability to survive high temperatures  but instead allowing it to minimize how often it must leave its host during behavioral thermoregulation  Overall  we have demonstrated that plasticity in different traits cannot be considered purely independently  and instead we must consider how these traits can affect each other   
The Effects of Endosymbionts Across Food Webs  How Aphid Endosymbionts Affect the Survival of the Predatory Invasive Lady Beetle Harmonia axyridis  Non essential  facultative  symbiotic microbes can provide their hosts with protection from parasites  pathogens  and predators  Recent work has found that two facultative secondary symbionts Serratia symbiotica and Hamiltonella defensa  provide their host  the phloem feeding insect the pea aphid  Acyrthesiphon pisum   with protection against predation from the lady beetle Hippodamia convergens  Lady beetle larvae fed a diet of aphids with secondary symbionts had significantly reduced survival both to pupation  We have recently extended this work to look at the fitness effects of aphid secondary symbionts  Serratia symbiotica  Hamiltonella defensa  and Regiella insecticola  in another aphid predator  the invasive lady beetle Harmonia axyridis  Similar to previous results  we found the survival of juvenile lady beetles to be significantly reduced for those that were fed aphids with secondary symbionts Serratia  as well as Regiella  however no fitness costs were found for those fed aphids with Hamiltonella or no symbionts  Also  unlike our previous findings in Hi  convergens where larval survival was reduced  pupal survival was reduced in this lady beetle species  Ha  axyridis  while larval survival was unaffected by the presence or type of aphid symbiont in the larval diet  Additionally  Ha  axyridis larvae fed aphids without symbionts or with the Hamiltonella symbionts were significantly heavier as adults than those fed aphids with the Serratia and Regiella symbionts  The presence of aphid symbionts in the larval diet of Ha  axyridis was also found to significantly affect development time to adulthood  Therefore this is yet another example of aphid endosymbionts  by reducing the fitness of the aphid predator  indirectly defending their host against predation  since aphids reproduce clonally and are often found in large genetically identical groups  Interestingly  the survival effects appear to be different between the species of predator  with one species being most affected during larval development and the other during pupal development  Additionally  for both predator species  different symbionts had different affects suggesting that each symbiont reduces the survival of the predator through a different mechanism  This work provides yet another example of the often far reaching and unexpected effects that endosymbionts can have in ecological systems and highlights the importance of expanding our study of endosymbionts to include the many ecological interactions of their host species  
Using sequence capture to reconstruct North American mammoth phylogeny and phylogeography  Using a rapid  highly scalable and cost effective targeted enrichment technique  we reconstructed the complete mitochondrial genomes of dozens of extinct North American woolly and Columbian mammoths from previously uncharacterized areas of their range  Though we uncovered strong phylogeographic patterns in their matrilineal diversity during the Late Pleistocene  their overall   interspecific   mitophylogeny is not consistent with conventional paleontological models of North American mammoth evolution  Rather than having evolved entirely separately for over a million years  we found evidence that woolly and Columbian mammoths were likely biologically conspecific  the two paleontological species having interbred at different times and places during the Pleistocene  We also characterized the sensitivity  specificity  and predictability of the capture experiments  and thereby outline various design considerations for sequence capture experiments whatever the target organism or state of DNA preservation  
Evolution of defenses against parasitoid wasps in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup  Macroevolutionary tradeoffs occur when species have different fixed strategies for resource allocation across a set of traits   In some host parasite systems  hosts can use multiple types of immune responses to alleviate the fitness consequences of parasitism   However  hosts must expend resources to deploy these defenses and maintaining strong defenses can be costly to host fitness   Therefore  ecological immunology theory predicts that tradeoffs will occur among immune responses  but direct evidence for macroevolutionary immune tradeoffs is lacking   Fruit flies in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup  which coevolved with endoparasitoid wasps in the genus Leptopilina across their ancestral African ranges  are an excellent model system for investigating this prediction   Female flies can practice behavioral avoidance strategies to reduce the risk that their offspring will become parasitized  and fly larvae can mount melanotic encapsulation responses to kill developing wasps   We have found that the strengths of behavioral avoidance and melanotic encapsulation are highly variable across fly species   Several fly species are able to use melanotic encapsulation responses to survive parasitism by L  boulardi  but only one fly species shows significant survival against L  heterotoma  demonstrating that L  heterotoma is much more virulent across this host range   However  each fly species shows similar avoidance of both wasp species  suggesting that flies do not modulate avoidance behavior based on wasp virulence   The strengths of behavioral avoidance and melanotic encapsulation in response to L  boulardi are negatively correlated across fly species  providing strong evidence for a macroevolutionary immune tradeoff   However  there is no strong correlation between defenses against L  heterotoma  most likely because this wasp can disrupt key components of the melanotic encapsulation response across this host range   Comparative studies of immune responses against common parasites have the power to reveal macroevolutionary tradeoffs and greatly improve our understanding of host parasite coevolutionary trajectories  
The evolution of semelparity and egg size  Salmonids have evolved two contrasting life cycles  semelparity  reproducing once  and iteroparity  reproducting multiple times   Egg size diverges dramatically among salmon species  but there are few comprehensive explanations for why  To address this question  I use a comparative dataset on variation in egg size within and across salmonid species to show that egg size varies with latitude and with parity  I then use a matrix model to show how costs of reproductive investment to maternal survival could explain both the evolution of delayed semelparity and larger eggs  T his result suggests that female investment tactics could explain the striking diversity in life histories across salmonids  
Genomics of adaptation to altitude in Mus   Organisms living in high altitudes are presented with physiological and metabolic challenging conditions due to the increasing reduction in barometric pressure and consequently oxygen availability with altitude  Hypoxia is a major stress physiological processes that can be detrimental to survival  and a powerful homeostasis system has evolved in animals to cope with fluctuations in oxygen concentration  Besides the plastic physiological response displayed by many organisms  there is overwhelming evidence for genetic adaptation to altitude in humans and other vertebrates  It is increasingly clear that these adaptations have a genetic basis  This study aims at investigating the genomic basis of adaptation to altitude in an organism that has been recently introduced to extreme altitude  Our model organism is the common house mouse  Mus musculus  We collected specimens of this rodent in an altitudinal transect in Ecuador  from 0 to 3000 meters of altitude  We have sequenced 50 complete exomes  5 localities  10 non related individuals per site   The results of the sequencing were assembled  aligned and annotated using the protocols described on Bi et al  2013  We used Angsd for calculating summary statistics of interest  and Structure and admixture for estimating demographic structure  For association with environmental variables  we used the softwares Bayenv2  LFMM and SPA  On the one hand  the list of candidate genes so far does not include genes directly described in studies with humans or other organisms  On the other hand  the list includes interesting candidate genes  such as VLDL  which is directly regulated by HIF 1  therefore being part of the cellular response to hypoxia   as well as SGPP2 and APC  both expressed in the lung and related to lung function   The list also includes genes linked to myogenesis and other developmental genes related to muscle  TAF3  TMEM2  VSP13a  and adipose tissues  BRD8  Phb2   These genes offer interesting candidates for not only adaptation to hypoxia  but also for the extreme temperature fluctuations in high altitudes  
Genes vs  culture  song variation across an avian hybrid zone  Song is one of the most widely recognized premating barriers to reproduction between avian species  In oscines both genetic and cultural inheritance contribute to an individual s song phenotype  contributing to difficulty in predicting the role that song may play in reproductive isolation  interspecific song learning could promote interbreeding  Here I seek to better understand this phenomenon by studying song in a narrow hybrid zone between black throated green  Setophaga virens  and Townsend s warblers  S  townsendi   I use multivariate analyses to compare songs in the hybrid zone to those found in allopatry  predicting that if song is a strong barrier to interbreeding  then there should be a relationship between song and genotype in the hybrid zone  I employ a genotyping by sequencing  GBS  method to identify thousands of markers and develop a hybrid index  Playback experiments were carried out in the field to test responses to parental songs  and a cline analysis was conducted in order to compare transitions in genotype and song across the hybrid zone  I show that only parental song types are found in the hybrid zone  and furthermore  that there is little if any association between song and genotype in sympatric individuals  this suggests that song is not an important reproductive barrier  Allopatric individuals responded only to local songs  indicating that individuals may exhibit a learned response to songs that they are commonly exposed to  I observed discordance between the song and genotype clines  the song cline was much narrower indicating that song is under stronger selection  Taken together  these findings suggest that song is not a reproductive barrier in this hybrid zone  but is instead a cultural trait that is maintained by frequency dependent selection  Thus  it may be more beneficial for males to sing a locally common song than to broadcast accurate species membership information  
Evolution of Tomato Fruit Ripening Traits  Through ripening  fleshy fruits like tomato go through many phenotypic changes  which are believed to increase the possibility of animal mediated seed dispersal  Fruit traits that change during the course of ripening include color  firmness  flavor and toxicity  These changes allow the fruit to have different functions based on maturity  such as protection of forming seeds when unripe  and animal attraction when the seeds are fully mature  However  even closely related species often vary widely in fruit ripening traits  and not all fleshy fruits appear obviously palatable when ripe  Little is known about the evolutionary processes acting on fruit ripening traits  and the genetic basis of such traits has not been adequately explored  The clade of species that includes the cultivated tomato  Solanum section Lycopersicon  is a good model for study of the evolution of fruit ripening traits  as the 13 species in the clade vary in several fruit specific traits  To increase our understanding of the evolutionary processes affecting fruit evolution  we are currently characterizing all species in the tomato clade for color  firmness  sugar content and alkaloid content at two stages of fruit maturity  Color change upon ripening is relegated to the most recently diverged species  which show a range of colors from yellow to orange to red  Our results also suggest that firmness on maturity shows variation throughout the clade with no correlation to phylogeny  for instance the species with the hardest and softest fruits measured are sister species  The amount of softening also varies widely with some species ripening to 70  of their unripe firmness  while others do not show significant levels of softening  Sugar levels also show considerable variation in total content as well as amount of change in sugar content through ripening  Alkaloids are still underway for investigation into variation in alkaloid degradation during ripening  as well as identifying whether this trait is found throughout the clade  
Phylogeny suggests non directional and isometric evolution of sexual size dimorphism in argiopine spiders  Sexual dimorphism describes substantial differences between male and female phenotypes  In spiders  sexual dimorphism research almost exclusively focuses on size  and recent studies have recovered steady evolutionary size increases in females  and independent evolutionary size changes in males  Their discordance is due to negative allometric size patterns caused by different selection pressures on male and female size  converse Rensch s rule   Here  we investigated macroevolutionary patterns of sexual size dimorphism  SSD  in Argiopinae  a global lineage of orb weaving spiders with varying degrees of SSD  We devised a Bayesian and maximum likelihood molecular species level phylogeny  then used it to reconstruct sex specific size evolution  to examine general hypotheses and different models of size evolution  to test for sexual size coevolution  and to examine allometric patterns of SSD  Our results  revealing ancestral moderate sizes and SSD  failed to reject the Brownian motion model  which suggests a non directional size evolution  Contrary to predictions  male and female sizes were phylogenetically correlated  and SSD evolution was isometric  We interpret these results to question the classical explanations of female biased SSD via fecundity  gravity  and differential mortality  In argiopines  SSD evolution may be driven by these or other selection mechanisms  but perhaps at different phylogenetic scales  
Pyrosequencing of surface waters in the English Channel reveals novel early diverging fungal diversity  Although zoosporic fungi comprise the earliest branching lineages within the fungal tree of life  they are also the most poorly characterized phylogenetically  Limited sampling of these fungi  especially from marine and estuarine habitats  and the combination of short backbone internodes with long diverging branches during the early evolution of the Fungi  account for much of this uncertainty  The primary hindrance to uncovering the full extent of zoosporic fungal diversity is the historical reliance on culture dependent methods  resulting in the description of only the most abundant taxa  or those most amenable to isolation in the laboratory  The recent use of culture independent molecular methods to characterize fungal diversity and community composition in terrestrial  freshwater  and extreme environments has revealed novel  early diverging fungal phylotypes  Additionally  these studies have found that zoosporic fungal lineages are often the dominant fungal component of their respective ecosystems   Since the recent description of the Cryptomycota from environmental cloning studies  increased efforts have been made to characterize and catalog early diverging fungi  yet marine habitats   and surface waters  in particular   remain largely unexplored  For this study  the newly developed autonomous Water and Microplankton Sampler  WaMS  was used to capture microplankton   
Missing snowball in house mice  Evidence against the faster than linear accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between Mus musculus subspecies  Distinct species in nature exist because of reproductive isolation  a collection of barriers impeding gene flow between individuals of different species  Postzygotic isolation  the class of barriers that act after fertilization  is theorized to evolve according to the Dobzhansky Muller  DM  model  The DM model proposes that postzygotic isolation emerges from negative epistatic interactions between mutations that arose in allopatric populations  The  snowball effect  is a prediction from the DM model that has received substantial attention  it describes an acceleration in the rate at which hybrid incompatibilities accumulate between two species with respect to the time since their divergence  Evidence in favor of the  snowball  has been found in fruit flies and tomatoes  but the generality of this phenomenon remains unclear  We tested the  snowball  hypothesis in a recently diverged group of subspecies that show partial reproductive isolation  house mice  We used a statistical approach we developed that directly incorporates phylogenetic history and considers whether incompatibilities are shared or unique between hybrids  We compared QTL for hybrid male sterility phenotypes  including testis weight  sperm count  and sperm morphology  mapped in two F2 intercrosses  The subspecies tree was constructed by summarizing 43 000 gene trees estimated from whole genome sequence data  In contrast to the  snowball  prediction  a model postulating a linear increase of incompatibilities with time received the most support  This result raises the prospect that alternative genetic mechanisms were responsible for the evolution of hybrid male sterility in house mice and draws attention to interpretative challenges with comparative genetic mapping  
Life History Response to Juvenile Stress in Apis Mellifera  Developmental cues can induce phenotypic plasticity which increases subsequent survival and reproduction  However  juvenile stress adversely affects later life in many species  including humans  In social species such adverse effects can be buffered by social environment  We were therefore interested in studying the effect of juvenile stress on the life history of the highly social honey bee  Apis mellifera  Two stressors were selected to test the hypothesis that early life stress impacts adult behavior and life expectancy  The parasitic mite  Varroa destructor  was used to induce disease stress in the 5th larval instar and subsequent development  Secondly  the oxidative stressor paraquat was applied to newly emerged bees  Cohorts of individually tagged worker bees were introduced in a common observation hive environment for life long monitoring  Both stressors increased mortality during the first half of life but the effects on behavior were weak and inconsistent  and no behavior consistently influenced subsequent mortality risk  These results demonstrate lasting mortality effects of early life stress  However  the effects did not last until old ages  which may be due to demographic selection or a social buffering  However  we did not find evidence for behavioral shifts that could have potentially compensated for the earlier stress in these long lived bees  More research is needed to understand the interactions between stress  social behavior  and life history in the honey bee model  
A Nearly Neutral Theory of Ecology and Macroevolution  Ecological neutral theory has been controversial because it assumes all individuals are ecologically equivalent regardless of their species identity   Rather than taking this assumption literally  the theory is better regarded as a null model  an approximation or as a first step towards more realistic models  Perhaps one of the most exciting properties of ecological neutral theory is that it makes dynamic predictions about both ecology and macroevolution and so might provide an interesting approach to link these two fields  Unfortunately  there are problems with the predictions of neutral theory over evolutionary timescales  however  this presentation will reveal how small departures from neutrality are enough to resolve these   The addition of fitness differences to neutral theory does not prevent species coexistence as one might expect   Instead  when implemented with a progressive model of evolution analogous to the Red Queen Hypothesis  nearly neutral theory opens up a wide range of new possibilities for the modeling of ecology and macroevolution  
Looking for signatures of social conflict in secondary metabolites of cooperative amoebae  In the study of microbial cooperation  one of the earliest and strongest predictions of social evolution theory was that microbes would have adaptations to exploit unrelated social partners  So far  some evidence is consistent with this prediction but cannot rule out nonadaptive alternative explanations  Here we use phylogenomics to test whether Dictyostelium amoebae use polyketides small secondary metabolites that often act as antimicrobials for interference competition when forming multicellular fruiting bodies  In particular  we examine polyketide synthases for signatures of an evolutionary arms race  rapid evolution via positive selection to create new products expressed during development  
Gene to brain to behavior to fitness  maintaining variation in sociality through avpr1a and OXTR polymorphism in bank voles  The neuropeptide hormones vasopressin and oxytocin modulate a range of socio reproductive behaviors important for mammalian evolution  In Microtus voles  the length of the microsatellite locus situated in the arginine vasopressin receptor  avpr1a  5  promoter region regulates expression of this gene  but a comparable regulatory system has not been reported for the oxytocin receptor  OXTR   despite the presence of a microsatellite  We initially characterized polymorphic allelic variation in the promoter microsatellites of both OXTR and avpr1a genes on gene expression in the bank vole  Myodes glareolus   By genotyping wild caught individuals  we artificially bred males and females based on the length of the avpr1a and OXTR microsatellites  We measured their reproductive success and survival in two separate field enclosure experiments  focusing on avpr1a and OXTR respectively   where the social environment was manipulated  density and operational sex ratio  OSR   Our results indicate that the fitness of OXTR and avpr1a genotypes is dependent on the sex and social environment of bank voles  We will discuss how sexually antagonistic selection and density dependent selection can maintain allelic variation in avpr1a and OXTR by focusing on the gene to brain to behavior model of sociality in evolution  
Do ecological communities co diversify  An investigation into the Sarracenia alata pitcher plant system  Investigations into communities of co distributed species is of central importance for understanding biogeographic regions  as congruent patterns across multiple species provide strong evidence for a shared response to the presence of historical events that have shaped both genetic and species diversity  Examining such communities with ecological relations in this framework is expected to provide greater insight  as levels of congruence among phylogeographic patterns can allow us to disentangle the effect of how historical processes have helped shape community level structure and interactions  Although many studies have been performed in a comparative phylogeographic framework  i e   analyzing species individually  then comparing across species for congruent patterns   fewer studies have explicitly estimated the evolutionary history of a community itself  where simultaneous analysis of the species is used to recover a community level signal  Both approaches have merit  and we explore their use in an investigation into the Sarracenia alata  F  Sarraceniaceae  pitcher plant system  The carnivorous pitcher plant S  alata is found along the gulf coast of the southeastern US  and contains a disjunct distribution separated by the Mississippi River Atchafalaya Basin  Recent work has recovered phylogeographic structure congruent with the major rivers in the region  suggesting that these rivers have structured genetic diversity within the plant  Here we explore the arthropod community ecologically associated with S  alata  and test for simultaneous divergence across the Mississippi River Atchafalaya Basin  a known biogeographic barrier   
A phylogenetic model for measuring departures from the mutation selection balance  Codon substitution models have traditionally been used to measure selective pressures in protein coding genes by evaluating the ratio of rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  Recently  we have proposed a mutation selection framework in which site specific purifying selection at the amino acid level is explicitly modeled  Rodrigue et al   PNAS  2010    Loosely speaking  under this model  substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or near neutral rate when they are either synonymous  or when they correspond to replacements within a sub set of suitable amino acids   substitutions to ill suited amino acids have much lower rates  As an alternative to traditional methods  we explore the idea of using our recent model as the null against which to test for deviations from the neutral nearly neutral regime  We present applications of this approach on a few data set of protein coding genes  and discuss how the null model can be extended so as to test for different reasons for measured deviations  such selection on codon usage  
physiological synergism and antagonism in the evolution of life histories  Evolution acts on whole organisms and thus  on multiple traits simultaneously  We still know little of how the underlying physiology enables or constrains the response to simultaneous selection on multiple traits such as body size and development time  which are often highly correlated with fitness  Previous work with insects has shown that these two life history traits are regulated by the interaction of the same three underlying physiological factors  growth rate  the timing of the cessation of juvenile hormone secretion and the timing of ecdysteroid secretion   Here we test a Critical Point Framework that predicts how antagonism and synergism at the physiological level enables or constrains simultaneous selection at the phenotypic level of the two life history traits  We show that these three factors explain over 93  of the response to simultaneous selection on body size and development time  This framework provides a bridge between too much mechanistic detail to allow for testable predictions on the mechanisms underlying the response to simultaneous selection and too little detail that ignores mechanism altogether  Evidence suggests that the Critical Point Framework has broad applicability to a diverse range of taxa including green algae  plants  amphibians and mammals and to other insects  
Host range expansion of MERS Coronavirus and the permissivity of receptor orthologs  Dipeptidyl peptidase IV  DPP4  has been identified as the receptor for MERS Coronavirus  MERS CoV  infection  with bat  monkey  and human DPP4 able to mediate MERS CoV infection  Other DPP4 orthologs  including those from traditional small animal models such as mouse  ferret  and guinea pig  do not permit infection  In order to understand the evolutionary mechanisms of host range expansion  it is important to identify key determinants in DPP4 that govern MERS CoV host range  First  we demonstrate that mouse DPP4  mDPP4  cannot support MERS CoV infection  However  we identified a combination of two key mutations in mDPP4 that allows the molecule to confer infection at a level approaching that observed with human DPP4  We test whether these two residues regulate species specificity more broadly by similarly mutating the ferret and guinea pig DPP4 orthologs  Interestingly  in mDPP4  one of the key mutations disrupts a non conserved glycosylation site  Similar to mDPP4  sequence alignments and predictive structural studies indicate that both ferret and guinea pig DPP4 harbor non conserved glycosylation sites within the region of DPP4 that interacts with the MERS CoV receptor binding domain  Therefore  we explore the contribution of glycosylation sites in preventing infection in these DPP4 orthologs  particularly whether disruption of glycosylation at the key site in mDPP4 is responsible for allowing infection  Analysis of the conservation of glycosylation sites across DPP4 orthologs may help explain the evolution of host range for MERS CoV  We reveal whether glycosylation is an important mechanism by which species resist MERS CoV infection and the implications for development of small animal models  as well as the potential for DPP4 orthologs to support adaptation of MERS CoV  
Multi tagged pyrosequencing reveals highly polymorphic MHC genes in the endangered San Joaquin kit fox  The conservation of wild species and habitats is challenged by human population growth  urbanization  habitat fragmentation  and ever increasing demands on natural resources  A metapopulation of approximately 3 000 endangered San Joaquin kit foxes  Vulpes macrotis mutica  SJKF  remains in a highly fragmented area in central California  with the third largest population residing in the city of Bakersfield  Disease is a particular conservation concern for the SJKF because scientists have documented cases of rabies  distemper  CDV  and parvovirus  CPV  in other natural populations of canids  and small population sizes make the SJKF vulnerable to extinction  In addition  carnivores that inhabit urban ecosystems have increased disease risks from interactions with domestic pets  raccoons  and skunks  One way that animals naturally resist disease is through the genes that support their immune system  and animals with the most diverse immune system genes are usually the healthiest  Major Histocompatiblity Complex  MHC  genes are crucial to an individual s ability to defend against disease  provide an important measure of functional genetic diversity  and have been implicated in mate choice and recognition of relatives  Therefore these genes may help foxes avoid inbreeding and resist disease  especially in urban environments  We used multi tagged pyrosequencing to characterize genetic diversity of three MHC class II genes  DQA  DQB  and DRB  from a total of 96 individuals  half urban and half wild  Using rigorous bioinformatics methods to limit sequencing artifacts  we identified 11 DQA alleles  13 DQB alleles  and 29 DRB alleles  which translated into 1  6  and 25 unique antigen binding sites  respectively  The high polymorphism did not correlate with sequencing depth or sample location  but was present across individuals and indicated polygenic loci for DQB  2 gene copies  and DRB  3 copies   Using Tajima s D  we found support for negative selection in DQA  D  1 71  and positive selection in DRB  D  2 82   We did not find a significant difference in the number of alleles carried in wild or urban kit foxes  However  a few common DRB alleles found in the wild population were absent in the urban population  which may indicate an absence of functionally unique diversity in urban foxes  MHC diversity in the SJKF is similar or greater than MHC diversity of widespread canid species  These results will be used to further investigate strategies of inbreeding avoidance in urban kit foxes as well as the genetic diversity of 8 foxes that recently died during an outbreak of sarcoptic mange  
Genomic differences reflect fitness over a small scale thermal gradient in reef building corals  Local adaptation was traditionally thought to be rare in high gene flow systems  such as marine environments  as the influx of migrants would drown out any signal of natural selection  However  next generation sequencing techniques have been used to uncover population substructure at a number of selected loci even in populations previously thought to be panmictic   This begs the question  what is the smallest spatial scale at which adaptation can occur   If selection is strong enough  can it act within a single population   We explore an extreme case of selection in the face of gene flow in reef building corals  where the spatial scale of environmental heterogeneity is orders of magnitude smaller than the average dispersal distance   We combine whole transcriptome sequencing with reciprocal transplantation to examine adaptation to microclimate temperature regimes within a single reef in the tabletop coral  Acropora hyacinthus  We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  associated with temperature regime  even in the presence of gene flow   We found that rare variants representing a broad range of cellular pathways were maintained in more thermally stressful microclimates  evidence for balancing selection in a heterogeneous environment   Survival and growth measurements from transplant experiments mirror genetic data  suggesting some genotypes are more resilient in the face of heat stress than others   These results provide information on possible mechanisms for coral resilience as well as the potential for populations to adapt as ocean temperatures increase  
Ecological and Genetic Underpinnings of Wing Pattern Diversity and Evolution in Butterflies  The hallmark of life on earth is morphological diversity  which is represented in spectacular sexually dimorphic and polymorphic wing patterns of butterflies  Since early evolutionists such as Darwin and Wallace  biologists have tried to find general ecological explanations for the evolution of morphological diversity  especially at infraspecific levels  We address this problem by investingating the remarkable diversity of mimetic wing patterns in butterflies  manifested in numerous sex limited or otherwise polymorphic forms within species  Historically  the major hypotheses to explain these polymorphic forms have centered around the concepts of sexual selection  physiological tradeoffs  and shifting balance  While there is interesting evidence to support components of each of these ideas  a broad ranging ecological explaination for this type of polymorphic wing patterns is still missing  Towards this end  we present a simple mathematical model that may explain nearly the full gamut of polymorphic diversity exhibited by mimetic butterflies  Our model is based on frequency dependent natural selection  predation  and sex specific advantages of mimicry  both empirically resonably well established  Our model predicts that mimetic diversity is arranged along the gradient of mimic frequency in ecological communities composed of toxic models and undefended mimics  We tested this major prediction with data on three real mimetic butterfly communities  and found distinct types of sex limited and polymorphic mimicry clustered at different mimic frequencies as predicted by the model  We further show with controlled experiments on the Papilio polytes butterfly that female limited mimetic polymorphism in this species cannot be explained by sexual selection  physiological tradeoffs or other hypotheses  Thus  frequency dependent natural selection appears to be the most parsimonius explanation for wing patterning polymorphism in mimetic butterflies  How are these polymorphic wing patterns genetically controlled  Does ecology influence the genetic architecture of these polymorphic patterns  We show that specific ecological pressures such as predation and aposematism indeed tend to produce certain genetic architectures of polymorphic wing patterns  In particular  we illustrate how doublesex  a transcription factor that controls sexual differentiation in insects  also controls female limited mimetic polymorphism in Papilio polytes  Similarly higher level genetic controls  which are widely involved in distinctly different developmental processes but are co opted  are predicted to control other complex phenotypes  Overall  our results suggest that the ecological and genetic determinants of highly complex and diverse phenotypes may be surprisingly simple  and may involve frequent exaptations  
 Speciation and chemical differentiation in the aposematic and mimetic butterflies  Melinaea   The tropical butterflies in the genus Melinaea possess conspicuous aposematic warning colors and they are extensively involved in M llerian mimicry rings  including with silvaniform Heliconius  Previous studies using mitochondrial markers have failed to separate the different species  and as such are postulated to have only recently diverged  Here we present the population structure and diversification of 7 Melinaea spp  from San Martin  Peru  using 12 microsatellites  Based on these results  we redefine species boundaries  We also collected and analyzed pheromones from males  which gather pyrrolizidine alkaloids  PAs  pharmacophagously from certain flowers and withering plants for protection against predators and as precursors for their pheromones  We compared the chemical analysis with the population genetic analysis to determine whether communities are chemically structured  and to elucidate whether male chemical signals evolve to convey premating isolation  We found that the composition of individual blends was significantly more similar within species than between them  even when samples were collected from different localities  We discuss what this implies for species specific accumulation of volatiles in male Melinaea and in species diversification   
Conflict increases cooperation between microbial species  How does community context shape the selection for inter specific cooperation   We investigate this question with a novel mutualism between Escherichia coli and a mutant Salmonella enterica   In lactose media E  coli excretes carbon byproducts required by S  enterica  and the S  enterica mutant excretes a costly amino acid that the E  coli can no longer produce   We competed mutualistic S  enterica against the non cooperative wildtype in the presence of E  coli and found that the mutualist settled to 45  of the Salmonella population   The mutualism was then made more complex by changing the environment such that a third species  Methylobacterium extorquens  was required to provide nitrogen   Increasing community complexity dropped the frequency of cooperators maintained in the S  enterica population to 10    Interestingly  if M  extorquens is switched from a mutualist to a competitor with S  enterica  i e  nitrogen is made freely available   the ratio of cooperators increases to 60   the highest observed frequency   Genome scale metabolic modeling qualitatively recapitulates our results and suggests that a competitor increases inter specific cooperation by reducing the benefit of cheaters   This work indicates that to understand the prevalence of mutualists it will be important to consider not only with whom each species is interacting  but also how they are interacting  
Exceptional avian herbivores  Multiple origins of herbivory in the bird order Anseriformes and its correlation with beak shape and body mass  An herbivorous diet  or a diet consisting primarily of the fibrous parts of plants  leaves  stems and roots   has evolved repeatedly in multiple groups of vertebrates including lizards  fishes and mammals  Although herbivory has also evolved multiple times among birds  its origination is thought to be limited by its consequences for the cost of flight due to an associated increase in body mass  Species in the bird order Anseriformes  which includes ducks  geese  swans and mergansers  represent a great diversity of diets including granivory  piscivory and herbivory  I tested whether herbivory has evolved multiple times within Anseriformes and its relationship to beak shape and body mass  I compiled data from published stomach contents studies and handbook entries to create continuous dietary categories for over 95  of anseriform species  The major categories included animal matter  seeds  nuts  leaves  stems and roots  I also collected morphometric data on the 3D curvature of the beak  tomium and culmen  from skeletal specimens representing most anseriform genera  Body mass data were obtained from published species averages  Support was found for at least six independent origins of a primarily herbivorous diet in Anseriformes  equal to the number of times herbivory has originated across all the rest of birds  The first PC of beak shape correlated more strongly and significantly with a more herbivorous diet than with any other dietary category  explaining over 40  of the variance along PC1 using independent contrast regression  The beaks of herbivorous anseriforms tend to be shorter  wider at the base  and have a sharper  dorsal curvature of the culmen  Surprisingly  a more herbivorous diet did not correlate significantly with an increase in body mass  These results raise the question of whether herbivory in birds necessarily implies an increase in body mass and why Anseriformes is exceptional among bird orders in the number of origins of herbivory  
 The combined effects of artificial warming  competition  and community composition on life history traits and patterns of natural selection   Climate warming has influenced patterns of growth and phenology in many plant species   The adaptive nature of life history traits suggests that any warming induced plasticity is likely to influence patterns of selection   However  competitive interactions can also influence the expression of these traits  and studies examining responses to climate change have not typically accounted for variation in the competitive environment   Selection for specific traits may be weaker or stronger in the presence of competitors  depending on common responses to warming cues   For example  selection for earlier flowering onset with warming may be dampened when a competitor species has an earlier phenology  or alternately be heightened when a competitor has a later phenology   This potential for competitive interactions to alter the selective regimes imposed by warming remains unexplored   We manipulated competitive and thermal regimes for 3 competing weedy plant species    Sinapis arvensis  early flowering   Chamaecrista fasciculata  intermediate flowering  and Ambrosia artemisiifolia  late flowering    Each species was planted in high and low density monocultures as well as in polycultures that included all three species   These communities were then either artificially warmed via infrared heating or exposed to ambient temperatures   Seed production was measured for each individual and selection on flowering onset  a temperature sensitive trait  and plant size  a trait representative of competitive ability  was estimated in each environment  Artificial warming advanced flowering in the early and intermediate flowering species   Competition with non conspecifics delayed flowering time for the intermediate and late flowering species  producing a response antagonistic to that of warming for the intermediate species   Intraspecific competition and high densities reduced plant size for the earliest species  while interspecific competition and high densities had the same effect for the intermediate and late flowering species   Elevated temperatures increased plant size only in the last species to flower   Directional selection for larger plant size was significant for all species in all treatments but was stronger in monoculture plots for early and late species whereas it was stronger in mixed culture plots for the intermediate species   Selection for flowering onset was consistently insignificant for the middle and late flowering species and was only positive for the early flowering species when grown in noncompetitive conditions  These results suggest that the effects of increased temperature and competition on a species may depend on its position within the developmental sequence of a community   Specifically  species with intermediate flowering times face competition from early and later developing species  and this produces a constraint on selection for flowering onset   Over time  this may lead to altered competitive dynamics that can act synergistically with the direct effects of global warming  
Getting into the cold  Evolution of adaptations to freezing conditions in angiosperms  Early angiosperms are thought to have been woody evergreen species restricted to warm habitats with few environmental stresses on their water transporting vasculature  they have since expanded into almost every climate around the globe  As angiosperms spread  they needed to evolve traits that allowed them to survive in novel conditions such as freezing  In this expansion  stem and leaf construction are crucial as they determine how a plant experiences changing climates  To understand the evolutionary linkages between plant construction and freezing exposure  we assembled a large database of angiosperm growth habit  in conjunction with existing databases on leaf phenologies and water transporting conduit diameters  environmental exposure to freezing  and an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny  We used likelihood based modeling to test for coordinated evolution between freezing exposure and leaf and stem traits  Climate exposure transition rates were strongly coordinated with leaf and stem trait states leading to different constructions in the presence of freezing  An evolutionary shift into freezing was coordinated with a shift to small conduits and or a deciduous leaf phenology when species remained woody or a shift to an herbaceous habit  In most cases  angiosperms had already acquired the herbaceous habit or small conduits before moving into the cold while they acquired a deciduous leaf phenology after moving into the cold  The data reported here reflect that throughout the evolution of angiosperms  plant construction and freezing exposure have been intertwined allowing plants to either withstand or avoid seasonal freezing  
Lizard scales in an adaptive radiation  non random variation of scale size follows climatic and structural habitat diversity in Anolis lizards  Lizard scales vary in size  shape and texture among and within species  The overall function of scales in squamates is attributed to protection against abrasion  solar radiation and water loss  We quantified scale size of Anolis lizards across a large sample of species  142 species  and examined whether this variation was related either to structural or climatic habitat diversity  We found that species in arid environments have larger scales than species in humid ones  This is consistent with the hypothesis that scales reduce evaporative water loss through the skin  In addition  scale number varied among groups of ecomorphs and specific aspects of the structural microhabitat  i e  perch height and perch diameter   This was unexpected  because ecomorph groups are based on morphological features related to locomotion in different structural microhabitats   Body scales are not likely to play an important role in locomotion in lizards  The observed variation may relate to other features of the ecomorph niche and more work is needed to understand the putative adaptive basis of these patterns  
Going with the flow   patterns of demographic divergence and connectivity in a Hawaiian stream goby   Understanding the evolutionary processes contributing to population connectivity as a result of larval transport in marine environments is critical to determining how local adaptations arise in the face of gene flow   Differential  post settlement selective pressures can reduce the amount of connectivity between populations  leading to population divergence   The waterfall climbing Hawaiian fish  Sicyopterus stimpsoni  has a life cycle in which larvae hatch upstream but are swept to the ocean and develop for six months before returning to streams   Subsequent migration upstream requires climbing of waterfalls before reaching predator free habitats   The environments to which juveniles return differ greatly between the youngest  Hawai i   1 MY  waterfalls are close to shore  placing a premium on climbing ability to escape non climbing predators  and the oldest  Kaua i   5 MY  waterfalls are far inland  placing a premium on predator evasion as juveniles migrate upstream  islands  However  larvae from different islands may mix in the ocean  resulting in high gene flow and little differentiation between subpopulations                We developed a spatially explicit individual based model  NetLogo  for the islands of Hawai i  Kaua i  and O ahu coupled with a Lagrangian transport model using current data from a daily regional Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model for the Hawaiian Islands   Using this coupled approach  we examined how topography  stream flow  predation  and immigration influenced population demography  optimal phenotype evolution  and the rate of evolution over the time period of ten years   The connectivity matrices from the transport model were derived from 51 release recapture stream points and provided estimates of immigration  emigration  and local retention solely based on oceanographic currents              Demographic differences between the islands were found with a greater number of resident adults on the islands of Hawai i and Kaua i than O ahu   O ahu s populations were sustained by juveniles through means of immigration and local retention  but did not contribute many larvae to other islands through emigration therefore  functioning as a sink   Furthermore  immigration and emigration is largely unidirectional with larvae moving with the currents from southeast to northwest  Hawai i to Kaua i    All levels of immigration resulted in diminished rates of evolution of optimal phenotypes across all streams and islands   However  phenotypes conferring improved climbing performance on Hawai i and phenotypes conferring improved predator evasion on Kaua i did evolve  Local retention within the islands of Kaua i and Hawai i was always present and maybe indicative of isolation by distance contributing to the potential for locally adapted phenotypes to evolve despite the high degree of gene flow between islands  
Evolving isolation mechanisms between two incipient species of an endoparasitic wasp  Rapid speciation of parasitic wasps results in many cryptic species  however  the mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown  Further  most studies on speciation in parasitic wasps have focused on phylogenetic patterns based on molecular differentiation  We evaluated potential pre  and post mating barriers to reproduction between two genetically distinct sources of the gregarious parasitic wasp  Cotesia congregata  Hymenoptera  Braconidae   originating from sphingid hosts  Manduca sexta on tobacco  MsT  or Ceratomia catalpae on catalpa  CcC   We compared male responses to female pheromones  elements of male acoustic courtship signals  and mating and reproductive success of F1 hybrid and F2 sibling crosses  Males displayed a  30  decreased response to female pheromone from the reciprocal source and male courtship songs differed significantly in duration  frequency  and amplitude  Wasps from both sources mated and produced F1 hybrid offspring in the laboratory  however  90  of hybrid females resulting from one of the reciprocal crosses failed to produce offspring due to encapsulation and melanization of wasp eggs  Results demonstrate that MsT and CcC wasps are incipient species in the process of evolving both pre  and post zygotic reproductive barriers  
An Improved Approximate Bayesian Model choice Method for Estimating Shared Evolutionary History  To understand the processes that generate biodiversity  it is important to account for large scale processes that affect the evolutionary history of entire communities of co distributed populations of organisms   Such events predict temporally clustered divergences times  a pattern that can be estimated using genetic data from co distributed species   I introduce a nonparametric  approximate Bayesian method of comparative phylogeographical model choice that estimates the probability of shared divergence histories across taxa using DNA sequence data   Using analyses of biological and simulated data  I compared the performance of the new approach to the current state of the art method implemented in the software msBayes   The results show the new method has improved robustness  accuracy  and power for estimating shared evolutionary history across taxa   Compared to msBayes  the new model better estimates posterior uncertainty  which greatly reduces the chances of incorrectly estimating biogeographically interesting scenarios of shared divergence events   The results demonstrate the improved performance of the new method is due to  1  more appropriate priors on divergence time and demographic parameters that avoid prohibitively small marginal likelihoods for models with more divergence events  and  2  the Dirichlet process providing a flexible prior on divergence histories that does not strongly disfavor models with intermediate numbers of divergence events   The new model is implemented in the freely available software package dpp msbayes  This tool will allow evolutionary biologists to better leverage comparative genetic data to assess the affects of regional and global biogeographical processes on biodiversification  
Selection on position and context of nonsense codons in introns  Introns occasionally remain in mature mRNAs due to splicing errors  Resulting encoded proteins represent a metabolic cost and may also have deleterious function  The nonsense mediated decay pathway degrades aberrant mRNAs  which it recognizes by the presence of an in frame premature stop codon  We investigated whether selection has shaped the location and context of premature termination codons in introns in order to facilitate nonsense mediated decay in seven model organisms  We conclude that both the location and context of premature termination codons are shaped by selection for efficient degradation of aberrant mRNAs  
CHALLENGING THE PARADIGM OF MONARCH MIGRATIONS  BEHAVIORAL COMPLEXITY AND ISOTOPIC VARIATION OF THE EASTERN NORTH AMERICAN POPULATION  Movement is one of the key factors that influences evolution  This project used the unique migration behavior of the monarch butterfly  Danaus plexippus  to investigate the effects of migratory behavior on population structure  Although monarchs are not yet endangered as a species  their migration is facing a variety of threats  Migration may be key to the stability of the species  for example by preserving or redistributing genetic variation  Understanding how movement influences the distribution of genetic variation across an organism s range is particularly important in conservation genetics  I used an approach that integrated genetic and stable isotope analyses to answer three research questions  1  To what degree is the resident population in South Florida connected with the main migratory population  2  Has the summer breeding range expanded northward  3  Do monarchs from different origins mix in the Mexican overwintering colonies  I found that migrants from throughout the summer range enter the resident South Florida population  but that the degree of connectivity is different for males and females  Males immigrating to South Florida also are larger than resident males  My results indicate that monarchs are breeding well north of the published breeding limit  and that monarchs originating north of the putative breeding limit are successfully migrating to the overwintering colonies in Mexico  Finally  genetic variation is homogeneously distributed across the overwintering colonies in Mexico  but there are subtle differences between the overwintering colonies in origins of the butterflies at each colony  Thus  overwintering colonies are not equivalent  Overall  we show that monarch movement produces patterns with greater fine scale complexity than had previously been described  Because of the conservation implications this complexity  future work investigating the processes that produce these patterns is warranted  
Inferential Evolution and the Reflection Principle  In this talk  we introduce an information theoretic framework for investigating the limits of adaptive inference  The framework is designed to work with a range of adaptive dynamics  including learning and selection  We treat organisms as regularity extracting machines which build efficient models of the environment  Here    efficient   depends on both the ability of an organism to predict future environmental conditions and on model complexity  The environment is represented by a stochastic dynamical system known as a hidden Markov model  At each interval  organisms make observations about the environment and use them to predict the future  Organisms use their observations to update a model  also a hidden Markov model  of the environment  Thus  we consider a discrete time evolutionary model  similar to the replicator equation  but with selection acting on an continuous space of probability density functions   this is Bayesian inference  An information theoretic measure of complexity known as the statistical complexity describes the minimum number of bits an observer of the organism would need in order to predict its future behavior optimally  This complexity measure is used to compare organismal complexity in time to the complexity of the environment  We find that the complexity of the environment typically places an upper bound on the complexity of organisms  We call this   the reflection principle    We explore violations of this principle through the effects of   1  transients   2  encoding constraints  and  3  hierarchical or ecological networks  
Genome size evolution in North American fireflies  Genome size varies dramatically across the tree of life  Certain taxonomic groups have received more attention than others  Here we document variation in genome size across 22 species of firefly  Coleoptera  Lampyridae   We find considerable differences in genome size within a genus and up to 5 fold across genera  Further  we investigate genetic and physiological correlates with genome size expansion contraction  
Reconstructing the molecular phylogeny of giant sengis  genus Rhynchocyon  using museum samples  Macroscelidea is the order of sengis also known as elephant shrews  The 18 extant species vary in size and pelage coloration and are restricted to the African continent   Giant sengis  genus Rhynchocyon  have historically been classified using morphological characters  specifically pelage color and pattern  We are investigating whether the currently accepted morphologically distinct species represent phylogenetically distinct species  interbreeding populations with a high degree of variation within a single gene pool  or some other genetic construct   Moreover  previous phylogenetic studies of the Macroscelidea have failed to take into account the phenotypic variation and geographical distribution of Rhynchocyon   Using fresh tissue and historical samples we analyzed 5 800 nucleotide bases  3 4 kb of mitochondrial DNA and 2 4 kb of nuclear DNA  representing all described Rhynchocyon taxa   These data were used to reconstruct a phylogeny of giant sengis and confirm the taxonomic classifications   This research seeks to provide a better understanding of the giant sengi species complex  the biogeographical patterns  and the historical causes for such patterns    
Constraints on speciation and local adaptation  On the role of variable selection acting among adaptive traits   Selection varies widely among populations and traits  and different modes of selection have different evolutionary consequences  Divergent selection  for example  plays an important role in structuring variation among populations  driving the processes of adaptive divergence and speciation  Balancing selection  on the other hand  maintains variation within populations  thereby constraining divergence and  in some cases  speciation  Despite these contrasting effects  the evolutionary ramifications of selection that varies in its mode among traits remain largely underappreciated  In the stick insect Timema cristinae partial reproductive isolation has evolved between host plant ecotypes as a result of strong divergent selection acting on a dorsal pattern polymorphism that provides varying degrees of crypsis on alternate species of host plant  Here we describe how selection acts to maintain a second trait that is present within populations of T  cristinae and does not differ in frequency among host plant types  a green   melanic colour polymorphism  We show that this colour polymorphism is maintained by balancing selection that is the result of a combination of ecological factors including spatially variable selection among plant microhabitats  resistance to pathogens  adaptation to climate  and sexual selection  In stark contrast to the dorsal patterning polymorphism  balancing selection acting on the colour polymorphism maintains variation within populations and  in a system dominated by divergence with gene flow  provides a mechanism to explain incomplete adaption and speciation  To further explore how selection acting on these two polymorphisms might influence evolution we carried out genome wide association mapping to determine the genetic architecture of both traits  We show that both colour and dorsal pattern are under simple Mendelian genetic control and that SNPs associated with phenotypic variation of both traits are genetically linked  This genetic linkage between traits provides a mechanism through which maladaptive alleles at the locus controlling dorsal patterning phenotypes can avoid selection when linked to the rare colour allele  Taken together  our results demonstrate how selection and genetic architecture can interact to constrain local adaptation and speciation  
A Comprehensive Multilocus Phylogeny of the Neotropical Cotingas with Comparative Analysis of Breeding System and Plumage Dimorphism  The Neotropical cotingas  Cotingidae  Aves  are among the most phenotypically and behaviorally diverse groups of passerine birds  This diversity has obfuscated cotinga taxonomy  and the resolution of previous phylogenetic hypotheses have been limited by taxon and character sampling  Here  we present a comprehensive phylogeny of the Neotropical cotingas based on molecular data for up to 7500 base pairs across six nuclear and mitochondrial loci for a sample of 61 cotinga species in all 25 genera  and 22 species of suboscine outgroups  We analyze these phylogenetic data using a Bayesian species tree method  and concatenated Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods  and present a highly supported phylogenetic hypothesis  We confirm the monophyly of the cotingas  and present the first comprehensive hypothesis of intrageneric relationships  Key findings include the first placement of Phibalura flavirostris as sister group to Ampelion and Doliornis  the paraphyly of Lipaugus with respect to Tijuca  and the first resolution of the diverse radiations of Cotinga  Lipaugus  Pipreola  and Procnias genera  Finally  we use our phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the increase in sexual selection associated with polygynous breeding systems fosters the evolution of sexual dimorphism in plumage coloration  
PHYLOGENY AND FORELIMB DISPARITY IN WATERBIRDS    Previous work has shown that the relative proportions of wing components  i e   humerus  ulna  carpometacarpus  in birds are related to function and ecology  but these have rarely been investigated in a phylogenetic context  Waterbirds including  Pelecaniformes   Ciconiiformes  Procellariiformes  Sphenisciformes and Gaviiformes form a highly supported clade and developed a great diversity of wing forms and foraging ecologies  In this study  forelimb disparity in the waterbird clade was assessed in a phylogenetic context  Phylogenetic signal was assessed via Pagel s lambda  Blomberg s K and permutation tests  We find that different waterbird clades are clearly separated based on forelimb component proportions  which are significantly correlated with phylogeny but not with flight style  Most of the traditional contents of  Pelecaniformes   e g   pelicans  cormorants and boobies  cluster with Ciconiiformes  herons and storks  and occupy a reduced morphospace  These taxa are closely related phylogenetically but exhibit a wide range of ecologies and flight styles  Procellariiformes  e g  petrels  albatross  and shearwaters  occupy a wide range of morphospace  characterized primarily by variation in the relative length carpometacarpus and ulna  Gaviiformes  loons  surprisingly occupy a wing morphospace closest to diving petrels and penguins  Whether this result may reflect wing proportions plesiomorphic for the waterbird clade or a functional signal is unclear  A Bayesian approach detecting significant rate shifts across phylogeny recovered two such shifts  At the base of the two sister clades Sphenisciformes + Procellariiformes  a shift to an increase evolutionary rate of change is inferred for the ulna and carpometacarpus  Thus  changes in wing shape begin prior to the loss of flight in the wing propelled diving clade  Several shifts to slower rate of change are recovered within stem penguins   
Inbreeding depression and the potential for genetic rescue in a rare cutthroat trout  The cold  swift waters of Colorado were once home to a diverse clade of cutthroat trouts  but at least three of those lineages have gone extinct  A fourth lineage is on the brink  the greenback cutthroat trout  Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias  persists as single population of fewer than 800 individuals in a small stream in the Arkansas drainage  outside of its native range in the South Platte drainage  This population  known as  Weird Bear Creek   WBC   is morphologically and genetically distinct from other cutthroat trout lineages  WBC trout are being propagated in a state fish hatchery with the intent of re establishing wild populations within the South Platte drainage  The hatchery population has passed through at least two recent population bottlenecks  first during the founding of the wild population and subsequently during the establishment of the hatchery population  Genetic analysis of shows depleted genetic diversity  and reduced fitness is common in the hatchery population  both suggestive of inbreeding depression  To determine the extent of inbreeding and ID in WBC and to assess the potential for genetic rescue  we used a combination of reciprocal crosses and a genotyping by sequencing approach to generate lineage specific SNPs  We performed three crosses  between two WBC parents  between two parents from another cutthroat trout subspecies native to west of the Continental Divide  CAR   and between WBC and CAR parents  We measured survival and growth of all offspring in a common environment and collected all individuals that died during development  We extracted and barcoded DNA from all parents and a subset of the offspring  including individuals that died as eggs and fry and those that survived to fingerlings  Using a reduced representation library from the pooled samples sequenced with a 1x300 Illumina MiSeq run  we found several thousand SNPs between the two lineages  and several hundred SNPs that allowed assignment of parentage to the offspring  We found that outbred offspring show significantly higher fitness than inbred offspring  suggesting recovery from inbreeding depression by genetic rescue  Future work on subsequent generations will demonstrate whether such hybrid vigor and the effects of genetic rescue persist after sexual reproduction disrupts interacting gene complexes  In general  the quantification of inbreeding depression and  potentially the identification of genomic regions and individual genes involved in inbreeding  can be used to plan genetic rescue efforts in a diversity of taxa threatened by small population size  
Embracing the Complex Causality of Cancer with Microbial Experimental Evolution  Despite the progress reported in cancer research  cancer remains a huge burden on society  There are many biological  social  and conceptual reasons for this  Cancer is a complex process that involves high genetic and morphological variability  However  the dominant model by which we study cancer  the identification of molecular biomarkers  treats cancer as a static  homogenous entity  The primary systems used to study cancer  namely human tissues and cell cultures  also present these characteristics  Alternative models that embrace the process dynamics and cancer s heterogeneity do not have empirical systems   they depend on theoretical work or computer simulations  Here I discuss the development of a new model by which we can understand cancer with its evolutionary  ecological  and developmental complexity  As well  I argue that microbial experimental evolution systems are untapped resources ideal for studying aspects of cancer  This novel model is a synthesis of the existing approaches and is based in evolutionary developmental biology  evo devo   particularly the phenomenon of modularity  Evo devo addresses problems of complex causality in the context of developing organisms  while attending to the intergenerational dynamics of evolving populations  A model that employs modularity shifts the attention away from entities to the relationships between the integration and individuation of parts and wholes  illuminating the changing dynamics between the cancer and non cancer cells as the cancer progresses to malignancy  A cancer model that embraces the evolutionary  ecological  and developmental dimensions requires a study system that can embrace those dimensions as well  Microbes are ideal for this because they are easy to manipulate  have short generation times  and large population sizes   multicellular yeast system  Saccharomyces cerevisiae   which can also be used as a representative model of development  Using experimental evolution methods  we can understand evolutionary causality by tracking the selective history and relevant environmental information  More concretely  we can  among other things  investigate the conditions in which the level of selection changes  and how that shift can lead to cheating and defection  While not modeling cancer proper  microbial experimental evolution systems give a tractable way to study the evolutionary  ecological  and developmental mechanisms involved in cancer progression  A better understanding of these mechanisms can help us understand and predict when there might be unwanted side effects or resistance to commonly used treatments such as chemotherapies  
Evolution of Recombination Rate in Angiosperms  The molecular mechanism of homologous recombination can affect genomic architecture as well as the efficacy of selection  Yet the evolution of recombination rate is not well understood on a macroevolutionary scale  and little is known about the patterns of variation in recombination rate among plant lineages  We investigated the evolution of global meiotic recombination rate in angiosperms using data from 30 species   We examined how recombination rate varies with genome size  LTR retrotransposon content  composition biases  gene family size  and patterns of molecular evolution using phylogenetic comparative methods  Our results are consistent with previous hypotheses that recombination rate is negatively correlated with genome size  which is likely caused  at least in part  by the removal of LTR retrotransposon content  Our results also suggest a role for recombination in the preservation of duplicate genes  which can be explained by an increase in the efficacy of purifying selection  Thus  our analyses indicate the importance of population genetic processes on the evolution of species and demonstrate that genetic maps can be a valuable source of data for comparative genomics and inform evolutionary processes on a macroevolutionary scale   
Functional genomics of adaptation to hypoxic cold stress in high altitude deer mice  Peromyscus maniculatus   In species that are distributed across steep elevational gradients  adaptive variation in physiological performance may be attributable to transcriptional plasticity in underlying regulatory networks  Because hypoxia imposes constraints on the capacity for aerobic thermogenesis  high elevation endotherms face a dual challenge because their thermogenic capacity is compromised under conditions where thermoregulatory demands are especially severe  We performed a series of common garden experiments that were designed to elucidate the role of regulatory plasticity in evolutionary adaptation to hypoxic cold stress in deer mice  Peromyscus maniculatus   a widely distributed North American rodent  Using a system biology approach  we integrated genomic transcriptional profiles with assays of metabolic enzyme activities  tissue level phenotypes  and measures of whole animal thermogenic performance under hypoxia in highland  4350m  and lowland  430m  mice from three experimental groups   1  wild caught mice that were sampled at their native elevations   2  wild caught lab reared mice that were deacclimated to low elevation conditions in a common garden lab environment  and  3  the F1 progeny of deacclimated mice that were maintained under the same low elevation common garden conditions  In each experimental group  highland mice exhibited greater thermogenic capacities than lowland mice  and this enhanced performance was associated with upregulation of transcriptional modules that influence several hierarchical steps in the O2 cascade  including tissue O2 diffusion  angiogenesis  and tissue O2 utilization  muscle fiber composition  metabolic fuel use  and cellular oxidative capacity   Most of these performance related transcriptomic changes occurred over physiological and developmental timescales  suggesting that regulatory plasticity makes important contributions to fitness related physiological performance in highland deer mice  
One generation viability experiments have little power to detect selection in genome scans  Utilizing a single bout of within generation viability selection to identify selected loci across the genome is quick  conceptually straightforward and relatively inexpensive  Unfortunately  it is also extremely limited in its ability to detect selected loci  even when sample sizes are extremely large  The primary problem is the trade off between detecting selection at a locus and the cost of viability selection in terms of numbers of surviving individuals  Given this trade off  within generation viability experiments to detect selected loci in genome wide scans should be carefully reconsidered and perhaps abandoned  
E ective payo  matrix in spatial games  Biodiversity and extinction are central issues in the Þeld of evolution  For well mixed populations  the evolutionary dynamics is captured by the replicator equations characterized by the payo  matrix  However  previous studies show that local competitions in structured populations lead to di erent dynamical behaviors  For comparison with replicative dynamics  it is helpful to construct an e ective payo  matrix for the global dynamics from the local competitions  In this work  we simulate the rock paper scissors spatial game numerically and extract the e ective payo  matrix by the extinction time in di erent parameter regimes  The e ective payo  matrix serves as a direct evidence of the robustness of biodiversity in the two dimensional network  The notion and the techniques developed here can be generalized to di erent systems with di erent spatial structures  
Do effects of nutritional stress on reproductive traits translate from lab to field   Life history responses to nutritional stress have been intensely studied in recent years  particularly in the contexts of global change and ageing   Most studies have been done under laboratory conditions  yielding only limited understanding of how stress affects nutrient allocation and life history in the wild  We used a lepidopteran study system  Speyeria mormonia  to test whether effects of stress on egg traits were similar in the lab and field  We first review the effects of adult nutritional stress on egg traits in the lab  yielding predictions for effects in the field  Several of these predictions are upheld under natural nectar stress in the wild  This synthesis demonstrates that laboratory studies can indeed provide useful insight into life history dynamics in the field  
Breaking the mold  the effects of mutations on phenotypic covariation in the fruit fly wing  The study of character covariation can yield important insights into the interplay between genetic architecture and selection in determining evolutionary trajectories  However  the implication of covariation for evolution depends on its stability relative to the evolution of the population mean  In order to better understand the potential of integration to change due to segregating variation or fixation of alleles  we used 12 mutant strains of Drosophila melanogaster  as well as 12 inbred strains derived from natural populations  All mutant strains were backcrossed into the Samarkand wild type  Sam   All mutations were associated with either the EGFR or TGF b pathways  known to affect adult wing shape  All individuals within genotype are genetically identical  and therefore their covariance matrix reflects environmental factors only  We extracted 48 landmarks and semi landmarks from the wing  and superimposed them using Procrustes superimposition  In addition  we used LORY  a recently developed method for evaluating local shape variables as the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of local deformations  This method translates the multidimensionality of the Procrustes coordinates into a multivariate dataset that is amenable to conventional multivariate analyses and therefore more suitable for quantifying covariation  All analyses were repeated for both datasets  as well as two different interpolation functions for evaluating local shape variation  the thin plate and elastic body splines  We calculated the covariance matrix and mean shape for each genotype and estimated their differences in terms of total variance  matrix eccentricity  matrix pattern  and mean shape  We found that the Jacobian based data using Elastic Body Splines as an interpolation model provided the best representation of mean shape and covariance differences  Mutants that differed more from Sam in their mean shape also had a greater total variance among individuals  suggesting an association between shape change and the level of phenotypic decanalization  Most mutants  however  had a lower variance   i e   were more canalized   than Sam and the natural wild types  Most mutations do not alter the eccentricity of the matrix  and there is no relationship between shape changes and eccentricity  Most natural wild types have significantly higher eccentricity than Sam  yet no association with shape differences from Sam  Differences in covariance pattern  measured as differences in average response to random skewers  correlate positively with shape differences  These results suggest a complex non linear relationship between development and phenotypic variation  and indicate that different aspects of the covariation structure can be associated differently with shape changes  
A permutation based framework for detecting genus level selection  The ability of higher level taxonomic units to be acted upon by natural selection has a long history as a contentious issue in evolutionary theory  Despite extensive theoretical discussion  the topic has largely evaded empirical resolution  Given the recent development of large  publicly available databases  a simple and robust hypothesis testing framework for detecting higher level selection could facilitate significant strides to resolving this question  We introduce a permutation based approach  implemented in the R package perspectev  This method allows for an explicit test of whether empirical patterns of covariance between genus level geographic range and survivorship are reducible to lower levels  We applied this approach to five different paleontological data sets of varying taxonomic breadth  geological timing  extinction magnitude  and geographic extent  including a previously identified interval of higher level selection during the Cretaceous Paleogene  K Pg  mass extinction event  Through simulation studies  we demonstrate that this method is a reliable means of detecting genus level selection for geographic range size  confirm previous findings of genus level selection in North American K Pg molluscs  and identify two other instances of potential genus level selection during Cenozoic background extinction events  Ultimately  we conclude that some higher taxa have  at certain points in history and within certain geographic regions  behaved as coherent evolutionary individuals  We show that evidence implicating higher level selection has varied across taxa and extinction events  and we release our method as a simple to use R package in the hope that others will help determine the relative frequency of this macroevolutionary phenomenon  
A single gene affects both ecological divergence and mate choice in Drosophila  Evolutionary changes in traits involved in both ecological divergence and mate choice may produce reproductive isolation and speciation  However  there are few examples of such dual traits  and the genetic and molecular bases of their evolution have not been identified  We show that methyl branched cuticular hydrocarbons  mbCHCs  are a dual trait that affects both desiccation resistance and mate choice in Drosophila serrata  We identify a fatty acid synthase mFAS  CG3524  responsible for mbCHC production in Drosophila and find that expression of mFAS is undetectable in oenocytes  cells that produce CHCs  of a closely related  desiccation sensitive species  D  birchii  due in part to multiple changes in cis regulatory sequences of mFAS  We suggest that ecologically influenced changes in the production of mbCHCs have contributed to reproductive isolation between the two species 
Using genetic variation to infer the comparative demographic history of avian populations in the West Indies  The sizes and distributions of populations vary over time  and episodes of expansion and contraction create characteristic patterns of genetic variation  Consequently  contemporary patterns of genetic diversity open a window onto demographic history  Here  we employ population genetics approaches to infer the demographic history of three tanager like bird species in the West Indies  Coereba flaveola  Loxigilla noctis  and Tiaris bicolor  We analyzed genetic variation in two mitochondrial genetic markers for up to 33 individuals of each species on each of nineteen islands in the West Indies  Understanding the causes of change in population size requires a large sample of populations to determine statistical relationships between demography and attributes of islands and species  In addition  comparisons across multiple islands allow one to distinguish regional effects  for example related to climate fluctuations  and island specific effects caused by localized environments or biological interactions  We used several indicators of population size change  including Tajima s D  Fu s FS  and mismatch distributions  to infer demographic history of the three species on each island  supplemented by Approximate Bayesian Computation  ABC   and signature shapes in haplotype networks to infer relationships among populations  All three species showed evidence of dynamic demographic histories  including genetic indicators of expansion in several island populations  Patterns of genetic variation and population expansion differed between species  but tended to correlate with island size  Island populations of C  flaveola and L  noctis were more differentiated over the archipelago than those of T  bicolor  Populations of all three species on Puerto Rico harbored higher genetic variability than on other islands and exhibited signatures of recent population expansion  The combination of population genetic approaches used here can provide detailed insight into the demographic and geographic history among discrete island populations  By comparing several species from the same geographic area  one can disentangle species characteristics from regional effects to better understand factors that cause demographic change  The Caribbean experienced a cool  arid late Glacial  which progressed to a moister climate in middle late Holocene  Following changes in habitat extent  as well as direct effects of climate on population parameters  bird populations could contract and expand in response to broad scale environmental change  In contrast  populations could experience idiosyncratic changes related to specialized biotic interactions that are independent of general environmental conditions  With historical demographic data acquired by the analyses mentioned above  we determine whether populations these three species exhibit similar patterns and timing of expansion phases throughout the archipelago   
Genome wide analysis of hybrid incompatibilities using an allele frequency method in Tigriopus californicus  In the early stages of speciation  the formation of maladaptive hybrids can usually be explained by deleterious interactions between the incipient species  genomes  These incompatibilities  known as Dobzhansky Muller incompatibilities  DMI   arise as a consequence of the populations diverging in allopatry  and can be due to selection or drift  In many animal hybrids sex chromosomes have been show to play an important role in this form of reproductive isolation  However  much less is known about how DMIs accumulate in animal taxa that do not have sex chromosomes  Here we used the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus  a species that lacks sex chromosomes  to determine how DMIs that lead to inviability accumulate between divergent populations  We sequenced pools of F2 hybrids from crosses between 3 populations of T  californicus and performed genome scans to determine regions of the genome that are affected by DMIs causing hybrid inviability  Allelic ratios in hybrids were compared to an expected 1 1 Mendelian ratio  In one cross  between two southern California populations two chromosomes are entirely skewed towards one of the parental allele types and two others have large regions that are skewed as well  In another cross  between a southern and northern California population  none of the chromosomes show the same pattern as in the previous cross  where the entire chromosome is skewed with only three chromosomes showing broad regions with skewed allelic ratios  Theory predicts the number of incompatibilities will increase faster than linearly with time  the snowball effect   however  the present results suggests this may not be the case for inviability DMIs in this species  While we cannot at this point determine the actual number of incompatibilities affecting these hybrids  the portion of the genome affected by DMIs in the first cross is much higher than in the second  even though the second cross involves populations that are more distantly related to one another  
Convergent evolution of a rare trait  the history of red flowers in Solanaceae  Angiosperms are known not only for their diversity of flower colors and forms  but also the widespread convergence of independent lineages on similar floral phenotypes  Despite this apparent evolutionary lability  some traits remain exceptionally rare  Using the tomato family  Solanaceae  as a model system  we examine the evolution of one such rarity  red flower coloration  This color is generally rare in angiosperms and accounts for just 1  of Solanaceae species  Using model based methods that account for branch length  the stochastic nature of evolution  and potential state dependent diversification  we trace the history of red flowers in Solanaceae and estimate the number of independent transitions  Our results indicate multiple independent origins of red flower coloration via at least three distinct developmental mechanisms  Given the repeated convergent transitions to red flowers via different developmental mechanisms  we suggest that the present day rarity of red flowered taxa may not reflect evolutionary constraint but instead reduced diversification rates  possibly associated with ecological specialization  
Microbiome Diversity and Dynamics under Neutral and Selective Models  Many current studies of host associated microbial communities  or microbiomes  focus on descriptions of microbial dynamics within hosts over short periods  or on the composition and diversity of these communities between hosts  To understand how microbiomes vary over time within and between hosts  it will be essential to develop a unified ecological and evolutionary framework that takes account of mechanisms of microbial acquisition  and determinants of microbe and host evolutionary history  For this we developed an explicit framework for modelling the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of microbial communities within a population of hosts  By taking account of basic microbial species acquisition mechanisms  we built our neutral models under different scenarios and explored different effects on the composition and diversity of host associated microbial communities using simulations  We found that host inheritance plays an important role in restricting the diversification of microbial communities while immigration from the environment  as an opposing force  tends to increase the local and overall diversity of the microbial communities  Acquisition from hosts and environment also affects the frequency distribution of species abundances within this host population  and even with our simple models   we are able to recover the typical log normal species distributions so often seen in nature  On the other hand  selective pressures on microbiome evolution were implemented in our selective models at host level and bacterial level  and under both of these two selection effects  microbial diversities are significantly reduced and the log normality of species abundance distribution is more evident   
 Geographic mosaics of phenology  host preference  adult size and microhabitat choice predict butterfly resilience to climate warming   The climate sensitive butterfly Euphydryas editha exhibited interpopulation variation in egg placement and phenology  This should expose individuals to diverse thermal environments  which we investigated by measuring   eggspace   temperatures adjacent to natural egg clutches in populations distributed across a range of latitudes  36 8 44 6¡  and altitudes  213 3171 m   Eggs laid >50 cm above the ground averaged 3 1¡C cooler than ambient air at 1 m height  while those at   Interpopulation variation in phenology also strongly influenced thermal environment and buffered exposure to thermal stress  At sites with hotter July temperatures  the single annual flight oviposition period was advanced such that eggs were laid on earlier dates  with cooler ambient temperatures  The insects possessed two mechanisms for advancing egg phenology  they could advance timing of larval diapause breaking and or shorten the life cycle by becoming smaller adults  The mean weight of newly eclosed females varied among populations by more than a factor of two  suggesting that variable size did influence phenology   Possible options for in situ mitigation of thermal stress include further advancing phenology and raising egg height  We argue that these options still remain  as evidenced by current patterns of variation and by failure of E  editha to meet expected biogeographic relationships  such as the expectation that populations at equatorial and poleward range limits be restricted to higher and lower elevations  respectively  This optimistic example shows how complex local adaptation can generate resilience to climate warming  
Temporal evolution of coral reef fishes  global patterns and disparity in isolated locations  Understanding the complex history of earth s endless forms  how they came to be and how they are sustained  has been a fundamental facet of biology since the dawn of evolutionary theory  This presentation examines the evolution of coral reef fish species  specifically the chronology and geography of extant species divergence  Many coral reef regions have a history of isolation and extinction  My aim was to test whether the disparate evolutionary and biogeographical histories of the world s coral reef regions have significantly impacted temporal patterns of speciation within regions  In essence  do assemblages in peripheral locations contain the youngest coral reef fish species  The evolutionary histories of species belonging to multiple genera from four common coral reef fish families  the Chaetodontidae  butterflyfishes   Labridae  wrasses   Pomacanthidae  angelfishes   and Serranidae  groupers  were reconstructed based on molecular data  Resultant phylogenies were temporally calibrated using palaeontological data  Species  distributions were quantified using IUCN maps  The ages of species with different biogeographical extents were compared using two approaches  The full phylogeny approach considered estimated divergence times for all extant species in the phylogeny  excluding outgroup and fossil calibration taxa  as indicators of species  ages  The sister species approach considered estimated divergence times as indicators of species  ages only for the species with the smallest geographical range area between two sister species  for all sister species pairs  The sister species approach minimized the effects of extinction and ancestral persistence on the estimation of divergence times and eliminated the co variance of species ages  Model fitting was also used to compare the distribution of species  ages across the whole phylogeny with age distributions of species restricted to the Red Sea and Hawaiian Islands  Temporal patterns of coral reef fish divergence were similar among major marine realms and regions  However  notable differences were recorded between the Red Sea and Hawaiian Islands  Red Sea endemics have diverged consistently throughout the last 16 Myr  whereas endemic species colonized the Hawaiian Islands in two distinct waves  0 3 Ma and 8 12 Ma   Differences in the proportions of allopatric and sympatric sister species between Red Sea and Hawaiian endemics were also detected  Despite differing geological histories  marine realms and regions have all experienced comparable and relatively recent divergences of extant coral reef fish species  Differences in age distributions and spatial relationships of endemic species in the Red Sea and Hawaiian Islands suggest that markedly different processes have shaped patterns of diversification in two prominent  peripherally isolated locations  Author contributions to the published version of the paper  J R H and D R B  conceived the ideas  J R H  compiled and analysed the data  and J R H  D R B and L vH contributed to the writing and intellectual discussion  
Old World fruit bats  Pteropodidae  vary in pollinator importance and selection exerted on night blooming plant species  Given their relative immobility  reproduction can be challenging for plants  Many flowering plant species overcome this obstacle by relying on animals to transfer their gametes  As these pollinating animals directly impact plant fitness  they can be major drivers in the floral and fruit evolution of the plant species they visit  For instance  different foraging behaviors can select for different traits in a plant species  Old World fruit bats  Pteropodidae  are typically classified as one functional group  implying that they interact with flowers in similar ways and exert similar selective pressures on plants  despite the diversity of this bat family  To study the potential selection exerted by different pollinators in this system  we examined the foraging behaviors of the seven most common pteropodid species in southern Thailand  We hypothesized that pollinator importance would vary among pteropodid bat species due to their different foraging behaviors  and vary by plant species as well  Specifically  we predicted that the diverse group of bats within this family would exhibit preferences for different plant resources and subsequently carry different pollen loads  We mist netted at six focal bat pollinated plant species to determine the foraging times and visitation rates of each bat species  We also collected and identified pollen from the fur of netted individuals to assess the pollen loads carried by each bat species  Our data reveal significant differences in the foraging times  visitation rates  and pollen loads of pteropodids  These findings indicate that pollinating bat species do exhibit preferences for different plants species and likely exert different selective pressures on their food resources  Our results suggest that Old World fruit bat species interact with floral resources in different ways and may belong to different functional groups  Studying the unique selective pressures placed by different pollinator species is necessary to fully understand the evolutionary past and future of biotically pollinated plants  
Investigation of gene expression variation within the Yellowstone National Park gray wolf population using RNA Seq  Modification of gene expression levels can serve as a first line response to sudden environmental and social changes  yet with potential consequences on individuals  fitness  With the advent of high throughput sequencing technology  it is now possible to examine gene expression variation for thousands of genes  in known individuals from natural populations  Wild gray wolves  Canis lupus  live in social packs and their position as a top predator makes them more sensitive to ecosystem disturbances  Furthermore  the gray wolf is a model species for studying population wide gene expression in a natural context  as its closest relative  the domestic dog  C  l  familiaris   has a well annotated genome  Here  we conducted an exploratory analysis of RNA seq based gene expression data from 27 wild gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park  USA  In this project we aimed to  i  assess genome wide gene expression variation in an easily accessible tissue  such as whole blood  and ii  identify molecular pathways and individual genes for which expression is associated with important environmental or demographic factors  specifically social rank  age  and sex  Our preliminary results indicate a strong effect of traits associated with age on gene expression patterns  with a significant enrichment of immune pathways  This project will help to define the nature and limits of gene expression response in wolves and evaluate of the potential of RNA sequencing as a tool for conservation  
Phenotypic variation and differential gene expression in opossum  Didelphis virginiana  populations inhabiting different environments   Correlating environmental with genetic variation is important for understanding how the environment and evolutionary processes jointly shape populations  phenotypic and genetic variation  The Virginia opossum  Didelphis virginiana  is a marsupial species widely distributed through Central and North America  inhabits different environments and shows phenotypic variation across its geographic range  Combining phenotypic data from live and museum specimens  environmental data from satellite databases and transcriptome data generated with RNA Sequencing  RNA Seq   we attempted to identify environmental variables and differentially expressed genes that have an important role in driving the phenotypic differences and adaptation in this species  We found that temperature seasonality and isothermality are the environmental variables explaining most of the variation  20 to 71   in skin pigmentation  coat color and body size  Also  the morphological data indicates that drastic changes in these phenotypes occur between latitudes 27¡ and 30¡ N  In addition  the gene Tyrosinase related protein 1  Tyrp1  is differentially expressed between tropical and temperate populations  Tyrp 1 has been shown to be important in regulating skin and coat coloration in placental mammals and other vertebrates  Our results suggest that different selective pressures related to temperature stability are acting in opossum populations distributed north and south of 27 30¡ N  and that the Tyrp 1 gene could be involved in the biological pathway affecting skin and coat color variation observed in those opossum populations  These results contribute to our understanding on how natural selection causes genotypic and phenotypic variation in different environments  
Whole genome sequence analysis of the allotetraploid Mimulus sookensis reveals a nuanced history of genome evolution  Phenotypic evolution is dependent upon genetic variation  which arises in populations as a result of the introduction of migrant individuals  recombination  and spontaneous mutation  Polyploidization  or whole genome duplication  can both complicate the manner in which recombination is able to create new combinations of genotypes and intensify the occurrence of spontaneous mutation  Recombination between homeologous chromosomes  ie  homologous chromosomes from different species contained within a single genome  is one mechanism which may allow new allopolyploid species to capitalize on the wealth of genetic variation within their genome  Spontaneous mutation is also an abundant source of genetic variation in neopolyploids  To investigate the role of homeologous recombination and spontaneous mutation in genomic and phenotypic evolution post polyploidization  we utilize Mimulus sookensis  a hybrid polyploid of Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nasutus which has recurrently formed throughout its range in the valleys of western Oregon  USA  and on the southern tip of Vancouver Island  Canada   Mimulus sookensis has small flowers  like its highly selfing diploid progenitor  M  nasutus   In contrast  diploid F1 hybrids and synthetic neoallotetraploid Mimulus are large flowered  like the predominately outcrossing M  guttatus  This reduction in flower size between neoallotetraploids and naturally occuring M  sookensis implies that phenotypic evolution has occurred in M  sookensis  Here  we present an analysis of whole genome resequencing data from M  sookensis  and its diploid progenitors M  guttatus and M  nasutus  to address three questions  1  is M  sookensis a fixed heterozygote throughout its genome  or is there evidence for homeologous recombination  which may have augmented the rate of phenotypic evolution   2  does one subgenome correspond closely to M  nasutus   and 3  has there been differential evolution of the two subgenomes of M  sookensis  which may have facilitated phenotypic evolution  By examining whole genome sequence data from naturally occuring allotetraploid Mimulus  and comparing it to M  guttatus and M  nasutus  we gain insight into genomic and phenotypic evolution post polyploidization  
The hunt for quantitative trait nucleotides  a near isogenic line approach in C  elegans  The individual nucleotides responsible for phenotypic diversity have been very difficult to isolate   Many known causal variants that affect traits in wild populations are of very large effect and variation in these traits tends to be explained by few genetic loci   There are many confounding elements that can explain the relative lack of causal variants  or quantitative trait nucleotides  QTNs   for more complex phenotypes  particularly alleles of small effect  limited marker density and sample size  and epistatic interactions   One way to elucidate quantitative trait loci  QTLs  is through the creation of near isogenic lines  NILs   where the majority of the genome  >95   is of one genomic background  NILs have previously been created for the nematode C  elegans and identified QTLs across the genome for several phenotypes   Starting with a NIL that harbors a  1 5 Mb segment on Chromosome X originating from the Hawaiian isolate CB4856 in an otherwise N2  lab strain  background  we have created a series of more than 1000 nested sub NILs that break up this segment into smaller regions by recombination   960 of these sub NILs were genotyped at 278 single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  using the Illumina GoldenGate platform   We are currently phenotyping the parental strains for a number of behavioral and fitness measures   Preliminary results suggest that these parental strains have different locomotory patterns   The large number of recombinant lines combined with the high throughput phenotyping approaches that we are employing should provide the power to resolve individual nucleotides contributing to trait variation within this genomic interval    
Comparative analysis of preference and performance genes in the evolution of host specialization in Neodiprion sawflies  Ecological specialization is crucial for the extensive biodiversity and overall abundance of phytophagous insects   Understanding the genetic architecture behind the evolution of specialist traits will enhance our understanding of host use adaptation and provide insights into species diversity   Previous research in Drosophila suggests that ecological specialization may evolve through widespread loss of function  LOF  mutations and pseudogenization in host preference genes  particularly those for chemosensory recognition and avoidance   Because of the lack of ecological knowledge in Drosophila  however  we do not know if these genetic patterns apply equally to the gain of novel hosts and the loss of ancestral hosts  or if they apply to host use phenotypes beyond chemosensation   To address this gap  I propose a genus wide study of the ecologically well characterized pine sawfly genus Neodiprion  with emphasis on the N  lecontei and N  pinetum clade and white pine  Pinus strobus  host use phenotype   I will compare genomic data to identify signs of LOF mutations and pseudogenization in chemosensory and detoxification genes and use RNA seq to identify expression divergence in host related genes   Genus wide comparisons will allow for the identification of genetic patterns unique to the gain and or loss of specific host plants and also for the identification of loci repeatedly acted on during specialization   This research will determine how general the conclusions from Drosophila are for phytophagous insects  contribute critical data regarding host performance  make it possible to distinguish the genetics of host loss from host gain  and potentially identify predictable genetic underpinnings for the evolution of host plant specialization  
Patterns of gene flow and reproductive isolation in closely related species of mushroom feeding Drosophila  How much gene flow occurs during the early stages of divergence is important for understanding the evolution of reproductive barriers  and how strong they may be at various time points in the speciation process  Here  I investigate the potential for gene flow among three closely related species of Drosophila that vary in their extent of geographic overlap  including D  subquinaria  D  recens  and D  transversa  A pattern of reproductive character displacement has been shown for D  subquinaria and D  recens  but how much gene flow occurs between these species and how they are genetically and behaviorally isolated from D  transversa is unknown  First  I ask whether introgression is possible by characterizing patterns of both pre  and post mating isolation between each pair of species  Second  I take a multilocus phylogenetic approach to investigate patterns of introgression among these species  and use modeling to differentiate between phylogenetic hypotheses of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting   
The fates of rare beneficial lineages in hypermutable asexual populations   The fixation probability of a beneficial mutation that arises spontaneously in a population is dependent on the fitness benefit afforded by the beneficial mutation  In classical theory  this probability is approximately twice the size of the benefit for mutations of weak selective effect  Haldane  1927   However  in an asexual population the spread of a beneficial mutation may be impeded by beneficial mutations arising on alternative genetic backgrounds  Gerrish and Lenski  1998   and by deleterious mutations arising on the same genetic background  I have shown using simulations that the fixation probability of beneficial mutations in asexual populations with very high genomic mutation rates is considerably reduced below the classical expectation  Mullers Ratchet refers to the stochastic loss of the best genotype in an asexual population due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations  The lower probability of fixation of a beneficial lineage in an asexual population that possesses a very high mutation rate may be attributed to the fact that the lineage size of a new beneficial mutation is extremely small  and hence Muller s Ratchet operates at a much faster rate in this small lineage than in the rest of the population  Simulations confirm this idea  showing that a faster rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations in the small beneficial mutation lineage leads to a reduced fixation probability at higher mutation rates compared to lower mutation rates  I am pursuing experimental work with E  coli populations to test these ideas  The initial experimental results suggest that the beneficial mutation supply rate is extremely high in these populations and may overwhelm the predicted effect of deleterious mutations  Ongoing work is directed toward developing tests of the fixation of probability of a new beneficial mutation in populations in which the background beneficial mutation rate is greatly reduced   
Genotyping by sequencing and latitudinal divergence in wild sunflower  Understanding the genetic basis of local adaptation is a primary goal of evolutionary biology  Population genetic differentiation is a popular metric for quantifying allele frequency differentiation among populations and by quantifying FST from loci throughout the genome it is possible to identify regions of the genome that are exceptionally differentiated and thus likely to play a role in adaptation  Wild sunflower  Helianthus annuus  is the progenitor of cultivated sunflower and is found throughout North America  Studying local adaptation in crop progenitors has the potential to inform breeding efforts with respect to global climate change and furthermore  the study of latitudinal gradients is important to aid in our understanding of how genetic diversity is partitioned in geographically widespread species  Previously we have utilized a single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  chip to describe differentiation across the genome among wild populations ranging from Texas to Canada  To build on this work we sought to increase our marker density from 205 polymorphic loci generated from the SNP chip  To that end  we have leveraged a GBS protocol for generating thousands of markers throughout the genome  Here we show that this protocol is capable of generating over 8 000 150 base pair tags that were both found in at least 6 of the 8 individuals sequenced and map uniquely to the cultivated sunflower genome  Although only about 3 000 markers map uniquely to the current 17 chromosome assemblies  GBS markers have increased the average marker number per chromosome from 12 06 to 173 56  Using a random subset of polymorphic GBS markers we were able to identify latitudinal differentiation  which is consistent with previous research on these populations  These markers will greatly aid future studies of the molecular basis of local adaptation in a widespread crop progenitor species  
Flexible decision making in a variable environment  when do foraging honeybees rob nectar   A behavior that is optimal in one environment may not be so in another  A key question is how individuals make optimal behavioral decisions when the environment is variable  It may be costly to assess environmental variation and switch behaviors  accordingly  fixed behaviors  rather than the ability to respond to variation in environmental conditions  might be expected to evolve  Alternatively  it may be costly to adopt a behavior that is not well matched to a given environment  in that case  flexibility should evolve  with individuals changing behavior as the environment varies  We tested these predictions in an observational study of honeybee foraging  On manzanita  Arctostaphylos pungens  flowers in southern Arizona  honeybees must make two foraging decisions  first  whether to collect nectar through the openings of flowers  i e   to legitimately forage  versus to rob nectar through holes chewed by primary nectar robbers  i e   to secondarily rob   and second  if legitimately foraging  whether to visit robbed versus intact flowers  As there is variation across plants in the frequency of flowers with holes  as well as variation in flowers  nectar volume  flowers with holes on average contain less nectar   we predicted that 1  the frequency of secondary robbing would increase as the frequency of flowers with holes increases  flexible behavior   and 2  legitimate visitors would disproportionately visit intact flowers  fixed behavior   but would do so less as the frequency of flowers with holes increases  a flexible component   Contrary to the first prediction  the frequency of secondary robbing peaked on plants exhibiting an intermediate frequency of holes  In partial support of the second prediction  legitimate visitors disproportionately visited intact flowers  but did so mostly on plants exhibiting both low and high frequencies of holes  We suggest that the discrepancy between these observations and the predictions may arise because plants bearing many flowers with holes had so little nectar per flower that they were not worth visiting  This study suggests that honeybees  foraging strategies show both fixed and flexible aspects  and that it may be beneficial to respond to environmental variation unless the cost of switching behaviors is high  
A Model of Genome Wide Patterns of Ancestry in a Secondary Contact Zone  Differentiated populations  or subspecies  frequently come into secondary contact  Understanding genomic patterns in such contact zones can provide insights into population history and the loci underlying species maintenance in sympatry  For example  the sizes of introgressed regions  or extent of linkage disequilbrium of ancestry  ancestry LD  can inform us of the age and extent of hybridization  Here we develop a neutral model to describe the lengths of admixed haplotypes and ancestry LD in a geographically explicit setting  We use this model to explore the relationships between time  geography and genome wide patterns of shared ancestry  This provides a suitable null model for investigating patterns of selection  and a tool for inference of the age of secondary contact zones   
Hybridization increases fecundity and size in invasive taxa  meta analytic support for the hybridization invasion hypothesis  The hypothesis that interspecific hybridization promotes invasiveness has received much recent attention  but tests of the hypothesis can suffer from important limitations   Here  we provide the first synthesis of studies experimentally testing the hybridization invasion hypothesis in plants  animals and fungi   We identified 72 systems for which hybridization has been putatively associated with invasiveness  weediness or range expansion   Within this group  15 systems  comprising 32 studies  experimentally tested performance  fecundity  survival  and or size  of hybrids vs  their parental species and met our other criteria  a surprisingly large number of studies were uninformative because they neglected to compare hybrid performance to the most invasive parent   Both phylogenetic and non phylogenetic meta analyses showed that wild hybrids were significantly more fecund and larger than their parental taxa  but did not differ in survival   Resynthesized hybrids  which typically represent earlier hybrid generations than do wild hybrids  did not consistently differ from parental species in fecundity  survival or size   However  using meta regression  we found that fecundity increased  but survival decreased  with hybrid generation in resynthesized hybrids  suggesting that natural selection can play an important role in shaping hybrid performance   and thus invasiveness   over time   We conclude that the available evidence supports the hybridization invasion hypothesis  with the caveats that our results are clearly driven by tests in plants  which are more numerous than tests in animals and fungi  and that a minority of systems clearly have no link between hybridization and invasion    
Visualizing cooperation theory in the non majors evolution classroom  free tools for teaching the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner s Dilemma  The Prisoner s Dilemma  PD  is a game theory construct that has become one of the standard models employed by theorists seeking to understand how cooperation evolves  Because the PD effectively captures the dynamics of social dilemmas in which the temptation to cheat is greatest  it has frequently been used as the fundamental building block of models that explore a myriad of potential mechanisms by which cooperation might evolve  For this reason  understanding the dynamics of the PD is a pre requisite for understanding much of evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the basis for cooperative behaviors  Traditionally  model constructs like the PD have been taught by introducing the mathematical toolset of game theory  While this mathematical approach may be effective for most students majoring in evolutionary biology  it is far less effective for most non majors  Does this mean that explaining how cooperation evolves is too advanced a task for the non majors evolution course  I contend that the answer to this question is  no   using the right approaches  non majors without significant mathematical skills can achieve understanding of the most important properties of the PD and therefore of basic theory explaining cooperation   In this talk I will introduce a collection of free teaching tools that I have developed in collaboration with digital artists and graphic designers  These tools are designed to provide undergraduate non majors with the opportunity to understand key game theory concepts without using any math  An interactive storybook introduces the PD and its four possible outcomes by allowing students to explore each outcome within a  choose your own adventure  structure  A series of infographic images allows students to visualize the most important properties of the PD  including how its potential outcomes compare to the outcomes of other archetypal game theory constructs  An interactive  inquiry based simulator allows students to set up their own Iterated Prisoner s Dilemma tournaments and analyze their results using a variety of intuitive data visualizations  During my talk I will show how these tools work  discuss how I use them in my courses  and answer questions about incorporating visual and inquiry based learning tools into the non majors classroom  
From dogs to apes  does survival of the friendliest lead to smarts  Cognition presents evolution one of its greatest challenges  How do we measure the private mental lives of animals in such a way that we can test how cognition evolves  I will present work examining the evolution of dog and bonobo psychology that suggests that social cognitive evolution can result from selection for friendliness  I will also present data from citizen scientist collecting data via dognition com to illustrate how hypotheses of cognitive evolution might be tested in the future 
 The evolutionary origin and development of adipose fins  exploring novelty in vertebrate appendages   Adipose fins are appendages found in over six thousand species of ray finned  or actinopterygian  fishes  The evolution  development  and function of these fins is barely studied  Adipose fins are positioned on the dorsal midline  posterior to the dorsal fin  Usually  adipose fins lack skeleton and associated musculature  Because of this apparently rudimentary anatomy  adipose fins are widely regarded as non functional and possibly vestigial  However  the evolutionary origin of adipose fins has not been studied in nearly half a century  Here  I test hypotheses of adipose fin origin  applying models of ancestral ancestral state reconstruction to a recently published phylogeny of ray finned fishes  These analyses find support for the hypothesis that adipose fins have evolved repeatedly  This result is consistent with the known distribution of adipose fins in the fossil record  As repeatedly evolved structures  I argue that adipose fins are likely adaptive  although their function remains untested  Understanding how morphological novelties originate is a primary goal of the evolutionary developmental research program  To begin exploring their developmental and genetic basis  I describe adipose fin ontogeny in Corydoras aeneus  Callichthyidae   a South American armored catfish  Antibody staining is used to characterize adipose fin neuroanatomy  In C  aeneus  adipose fin development involves the retention and elaboration of a larval structure  the median fin fold  MFF   During adipose fin development  mesenchyme migrates into the MFF and condenses to form an ossified adipose fin spine  This ossification begins halfway along the proximo distal axis of the MFF and then extends both proximally and distally until it reaches the body wall  at which point adipose fin nerves are apparent  These nerves originate from dorsal rami of the spinal cord and possibly also from the recurrent ramus of the facial nerve  In adults  a primary adipose fin nerve runs along the proximo distal axis of the fin  posterior to the fin spine  This primary nerve repeatedly ramifies  extending projections along the antero posterior axis of the fin  which terminate as free nerve endings  This anatomy suggests that the adipose fins of C  aeneus have sensory potential  consistent with the hypotheses that they function as flow sensors  I compare the development of adipose fins in C  aeneus to what is known of other species and also other fin systems  Collectively  these results highlight adipose fins as a powerful and underexploited model exploring of homoplasy  evolutionary novelty  and principles of aquatic locomotion  
Physiological divergence as a driver of the Anolis adaptive radiation  Two important questions in the study of adaptive radiation are 1  how does selection shape phenotypes along important axes of ecological divergence  2  how does this divergence facilitate species coexistence  West Indian Anolis lizards have served as an important model system to address these questions  driven by analyses of morphological specialization  However  morphological specialization cannot fully explain the Greater Antillean Anolis radiation because most cladogenic events have occurred within ecomorphological types  Here  I focus on physiological divergence among anoles  asking how thermal physiology evolves across two Greater Antillean islands  Puerto Rico and Jamaica  I find that both optimal temperatures for physiological performance and upper thermal tolerance limits evolve in response to divergent thermal regimes  Furthermore  I demonstrate that these divergence events have significant adaptive performance consequences under ecologically relevant thermal conditions  Finally  I demonstrate that these divergence events likely facilitate high community level species diversity  across both Puerto Rico and Jamaica  if two morphologically similar species co occur  they invariably differ in thermal physiology  These results demonstrate how physiological divergence can play an important  and often underappreciated  role in evolutionary radiations  
Exploring genome wide signals of selection against gene flow  Selection against alleles which are maladaptive in a particular environment or genomic background can maintain local adaptations and species in the face of even high levels of gene flow  Such selection implies an effective reduction in rates of gene flow at and close to loci under selection  This may lead to heterogeneity in divergence along the genome and allow further differentiation due to selection and genetic drift at linked and unlinked sites  The idea of expressing the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity in terms of an effective migration rate goes back to Petry  1983  and has been subsequently developed by others  Here  we extend these ideas to a genome wide context  and explore the extent to which selection against gene flow leaves a distinct and detectable signal in the patterns of neutral diversity  We test this approach against simulations and genome wide sequencing data  
Reduced specialization and modularity in an intimate mutualism diversifying on young oceanic islands  Recent work in ecological network structure has shown that disparate interactions can show patterns of specialization   This raises two important problems in understanding what factors promote the evolution and maintenance of specialization   First  to what extent does interaction intimacy  the degree of biological integration between species  predict specialization   Second  how does network structure vary spatiotemporally in taxonomically related interactions   Prior work has suggested that high intimacy mutualisms have high modularity and high reciprocal specialization compared to low intimacy mutualisms   However  such high intimacy assemblages often are characterized by low species richnesses  Nplants  Nanimals Glochidion  and leafflower moths  Lepidoptera  Epicephala  in continental  Japan  and oceanic island  Society Islands  assemblages   We sampled moths from 10 leafflower species on three of the Society Islands  determined species diversity and network structure using molecular and morphological approaches  and compared these to equivalent data from four sites in Japan from a previous study   We measured modularity using MODULAR  measured indirect effects using pathway proliferation  and measured reciprocal specialization using information entropy and multiplication of dependences of plant and animal taxa in the interaction matrix   We find more asymmetric regional assemblage richness in the Societies  10 leafflower spp  and 3 moth spp   than in Japan  5 leafflower spp  and 5 moth spp     One Societies Epicephala taxon appears to be a  super generalist  which interacts with 9 out of 10 available hosts   All Japanese assemblages show high modularity and reciprocal specialization   Two Societies assemblages  Huahine and Tahiti  lack modularity while the third  Moorea  is modular   Pathway proliferation results show that structurally similar networks may have important differences in their potential for indirect effect propagation  For example  Tahiti and Huahine have a one order of magnitude difference in the number of higher pathway lengths connecting pairs of species  These indicate that a  in continental regions  brood pollination assemblages show similarly high modularity and reciprocal specialization as do ant myrmecophyte assemblages  supporting the hypothesis that biological intimacy promotes these network properties  b  network properties and specialization can vary spatiotemporally within the same mutualism  c   super generalist  taxa may also exist in high intimacy mutualisms  d  highly connected  non modular small networks vary in their potential for the propagation of indirect effects  with potentially important consequences for convergent trait evolution  Finally  the novel methods presented here can be profitably applied to the topological analysis of other small networks  
Cytotype growth response to phosphorus limitation and arbuscular mycorhizal colonization in  Chamerion angustifolium  Variation in the outcomes of generally mutualistic interactions  such as the symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal  AM  fungi and land plants  can be modeled as an exchange of resources between symbiotic partners who vary in resource acquisition capabilities  Under this type of biological market model  benefit to a symbiotic partner can be predicted to depend on the relative cost of acquiring limiting nutrients such as carbon and phosphorus  For example  plants that have higher phosphorus requirements may be more likely to benefit from interacting with a symbiont that can provide phosphorus  In this study  we tested the outcome of symbiosis with Glomus intraradices on diploid and tetraploid populations of Chamerion angustifolium  We hypothesized that increased phosphorus requirements in tetraploid cytotypes would increase their dependence on AM fungi relative to diploids  Cytotypes were grown in a factorial experiment where both phosphorus and the presence of the AM fungal symbiont were manipulated  Preliminary results show that the shoot biomass of both cytotypes increased by the same degree in response to phosphorus addition  suggesting that both cytotypes were equally limited by phosphorus  Mycorhizal colonization appeared to increase diploid biomass under low phosphorus  but had no effect on tetraploid biomass   These findings suggest that polyploids may not be more phosphorus limited than diploids  and that polyploidy is not necessarily responsible for variability in plant response to mycorrhizal colonization  
Modality interactions alter call trait preferences in gray tree frogs  Animal displays often comprise various modalities  and the presence of one display component can alter receiver responses to other components  Sometimes additional components merely increase the probability of response  but receivers may also prefer different trait values or show different selectivity depending on whether a component is presented in isolation or as part of a multimodal display  I conducted playback trials with female frogs to test the hypothesis that receiver responses are affected by modality interactions  I obtained preference functions for several call traits under two experimental conditions   i  unimodal   auditory stimulation only  and  ii  multimodal   auditory + visual stimulation  and describe variation in preference function shape and preference traits  i e   preferred value  selectivity  responsiveness   I show that receiver preferences differ as a function of available signal modalities  and that the effect of adding a visual cue to an auditory signal varies depending on the call trait in question  I also compare the unimodal and multimodal preferences with the trait distribution of males  to test which preference function best predicts display trait distribution  Finally  I discuss the consequences of modality interactions for sexual selection and signal evolution  
Sea slugs have their cake and eat it too  a phylogenetic analysis of sponge eating nudibranchs and the defense chemicals they take and reuse  Brightly colored sea slugs that live in the most biodiverse and threatened coral reefs on the planet have evolved the ability to take their prey s toxic chemical compounds and use them for their own defense  Glossodoris nudibranchs  Mollusca  Gastropoda  Opisthobranchia  Chromodorididae  feed on sponges that synthesize sesterterpenoid defensive chemical compounds  Sesterterpenoid compounds exhibit a wide range of biological properties that aid in organism defense and have biomedical potential  including cytotoxicity  antimicrobial  ichthyotoxicity  antitumor  and anti HIV  Nudibranch tooth morphology has traditionally been used for classification and sponge prey from many species has been well documented  but with recent advances in molecular systematics  many of these relationships have changed  A recent mitochondrial phylogeny of the Chromodorididae revealed many misplaced Glossodoris  While chemical compound data remains accurate for species  conclusions drawn about the types of compounds found within the genus as a whole contain inaccuracies  These discrepancies emphasize the necessity of a well resolved phylogeny prior to the examination of chemical sequestration in nudibranchs  In this study  50 individuals comprising 18 taxa were used to build a more robust phylogenetic tree of Glossodoris  Molecular phylogenetic analyses were performed on two mitochondrial genes  COI and 16s  and one nuclear gene  28s   and maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical analyses were conducted to support the hypothesized evolutionary relationships within Glossodoris  Additionally we examine preexisting chemical profiles for current and previously identified Glossodoris based on morphological data alone  Because nudibranchs are stenophagus feeders  we hypothesize that Glossodoris nudibranchs that are more closely related with similar prey species will share similarities in tooth morphology and chemical profile  These results will provide insight into the evolution of chemical defense sequestering in nudibranchs  allow for a deeper understanding of coevolution and prey choice of Glossodoris nudibranchs  and aid in prospecting promising chemical compounds for biomedical applications   
The role of adaptive introgression in a case of incipient speciation in Mimulus  Identifying the source of the adaptive alleles responsible for trait divergence and fitness variation in nature is a long standing goal of evolutionary biology  Typically  this involves distinguishing whether selection acted on new or pre existing variation  However  natural hybridization between recently diverged lineages also may play a significant  yet underappreciated role in this process  Through a process known as adaptive introgression  an allele that has high fitness in a novel environment can pass readily across a taxonomic boundary even if hybrids are relatively unfit  In this study  we use phylogenetics  genomics  and functional genetic approaches to demonstrate that historical hybridization between divergent taxa has led to the spread of an adaptive allele conferring red flowers in Mimulus aurantiacus  Moreover  because this allele has been demonstrated to be under strong divergent selection as a consequence of differences in pollinator visitation  the introgression of this adaptive allele also has important implications for the evolution of reproductive isolation and the subsequent origins of new species  Therefore  despite a rich history of debate about hyrbidizations role in evolution  our results suggest that it can be seen as a prolific source of the alleles that contribute to both adaptation and speciation  
Dissecting an intersexual genetic correlation for fitness using whole genome sequence data  The intersexual genetic correlation for fitness  rw m f   is a key parameter describing the evolutionary potential of sexual populations  For example  the independent evolution of males and females can be impeded when rw m f  is negative owing to a preponderance of sexually antagonistic genetic variation  Because rw m f  summarises the combined effects across all fitness affecting loci in the genome  there are many potential combinations of alleles that could underlie a given value of rw m f    Alleles may vary in frequency  and their degree of pleiotropy on male and female fitness  To date  these parameters remain unknown for any organism  In this talk I will share our most recent attempts to address this shortcoming  using sex specific fitness assays in a panel of over 100 fully sequenced lines of Drosophila serrata derived from a natural Australian population   
Bacteria phage coevolution within plant hosts  The formation  stability and function of bacterial populations and communities are central to many ecological processes and are of key importance to the health of eukaryotic organisms  It is increasingly clear that these populations are highly dynamic over time  in part due to interactions with bacteriophage viruses  In this talk I examine the potential role that phages might play in shaping these populations and communities over both ecological and evolutionary timescales  I present data from a series of experiments in which the role of the plant host genotype in shaping bacteria phage coevolution is explored  and discuss when and how phage mediated selection might alter the interaction between plants and their bacterial pathogens  
HOW SPECIFICITY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY DRIVE THE COEVOLUTION OF STATIC TRAIT DIVERSITY IN HOSTS AND PARASITES  There is typically considerable variation in the level of infectivity of parasites and the degree of resistance of hosts within populations  This trait variation is critical not only to the evolutionary dynamics but also to the epidemiology  and potentially the control of infectious disease  However  we lack an understanding of the processes that generate and maintain this trait diversity  I discuss a series of models that examine how epidemiological feedbacks and the characteristics of the interaction between host types and parasites strains determine the coevolution of host parasite diversity  The interactions include continuous characterisations of the key phenotypic features of classic gene for gene and matching allele models  We show that when there are costs to resistance in the hosts and infectivity in the parasite  epidemiological feedbacks may generate diversity but this is limited to dimorphism  often of extreme types  in a broad range of realistic infection scenarios  For trait polymorphism  there needs to be both specificity of infection between host types and parasite strains as well as incompatibility between particular strains and types  
Competition kernels and coexistence  Modelling interspecific competition  and how it varies with species traits  is central to theory about coexistence and diversity   In many models  the competitive effect of one species on another is calculated directly from traits  using simple functional forms  e g   gaussian  sigmoidal   increasing linearly with species abundance   This approach is disconnected from empirical studies of competition  where such quantities are extremely difficult to measure   We aim to bridge this gap using models where competition emerges implicitly via the use of common resources  both simple phenomenological models and more complex mechanistic models   Our results suggest that even in simple models with implicit competition  simple functional forms are often insufficient to capture ecological or evolutionary dynamics and thus question the widespread use of such functions in current theory 
 Sex  mating system  and the evolution of lifespan in Pristionchus nematodes   Most animals are gonochoristic  comprised of both males and females  but some species have replaced females with self fertile hermaphrodites   Self fertile hermaphrodites are powerful systems for studying the evolutionary roles of sex and mating  as the transition to hermaphroditism will alter the strength and form of selection on many traits related to reproduction   In particular  the capacity for self fertilization will provide reproductive assurance and lower the average age of reproduction  which should result in altered selection on lifespan and ageing   Here  I employed a comparative approach to explore the relationship between mating system and lifespan in Pristionchus nematodes  a genus where hermaphroditism has evolved multiple times independently   Lifespan of unmated individuals under lab conditions was assayed for five hermaphroditic species and six gonochoristic species   Median survival time varied considerably among species  depending on both clade and sex  hermaphrodite lifespan ranged from 20 60 days whereas gonochorist lifespan ranged from 40 60 days for males and 50 90 days for females   Hermaphrodite lifespan was unrelated to brood size  suggesting that reduced hermaphdotie lifespan is not simply a consequence of reproductive costs   The degree of sexual dimorphism in lifespan varied among gonochorists  with females living significantly longer than males in three distantly related species   Further experiments were then conducted using hermaphroditic P  pacificus  a model species for evo devo research  and its gonochoristic sister species  P  exspectatus   These closely related species can form viable F1 progeny in the lab  yet P  exspectatus females can live approximately four times as long as P  pacificus hermaphrodites   Differences in lifespan were found among strains of P  pacificus  but this variation was small compared to the level seen between species   The capacity of unmated P  exspectatus females to reproduce declines with age faster than it does for conspecific males  suggesting the possibility of sexually dimorphic post reproductive lifespan   Culturing females and hermaphrodites with conspecific males significantly reduced lifespan  with many females hermaphrodites dying from matricide  the hatching of unlaid eggs within the mother  which suggests that mating bears costs and that the sexes may be in conflict over egg laying rate   Nematodes have proven useful systems for studying the mechanistic basis of ageing  efforts are underway to explore molecular correlates of ageing within among Pristionchus species using transcriptomic approaches   Taken together  this work demonstrates a large effect of mating system on lifespan in Pristionchus nematodes and provides a foundation for future studies directed at uncovering the molecular changes underlying natural variation in ageing among species  
Anchored Phylogenomics in Angiosperms  Utility across Angiosperms at Shallow Levels   P { margin bottom  0 08in  direction  ltr  widows  2  orphans  2  } We identified 499 low copy  relatively conserved target exons and produced a target enrichment kit for those exons for use across the angiosperms using their sequences in 26 genomes  With collaborators  we enriched genomic libraries for 50 angiosperms  representing seven relatively shallow clades in orders from across the phylogeny  Poales  Brassicales  Dipsacales  Caryophyllales  Proteales  and Magnoliales   The kit had an average enrichment success of 93 6  of the targets across the 50 species  range   82 4 98 2    and the assembled locus length averaged 903 bases  range   428 2766  for the 50 species  The most intensively sampled shallow clade is Rhynchospora  beaksedges  Cyperaceae  Poales   from which the 499 exons and their more variable flanking regions have been sequenced from 12 species  The phylogeny of Rhynchospora inferred using the exons alone is mostly well resolved and well supported and will be compared with that inferred using the flanking regions  As time permits  the utility of the target loci in each of the six remaining shallow level clades sampled from across the angiosperms will be discussed  Targeting the same loci across phylogenomic studies in the angiosperms can lead to greater combinability of data across studies  with relatively deep level studies using data from the exons but generating flanking region data that could be used in other  shallow level studies with taxonomic overlap  Shared targeting of loci across the community could also produce a more precise   ultra barcode   data set  compared to the current plant DNA barcode targets of rbcL and matk  two plastid genes  Rhynchospora is a distinctive member of the southeastern US flora  where the Evolution 2014 meetings are being held   it contains the greatest number of taxa  49  endemic to the Southeastern US Coastal Plain  
EVOLUTION OF INCREASED ADULT LONGEVITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER POPULATIONS AS CORRELATED RESPONSE FOR ADAPTATION TO LARVAL CROWDING  For holometabolous animals  such as fruit flies  larval crowding is one of the most important stress factors  which in turn induces both nutritional limitation and increased exposure to toxic waste products during development  Larval crowding has been shown to be capable of selecting for a wide range of traits  including larval tolerance to toxic waste products  pre adult development time  survival rate  adult body size  fecundity etc  It also affects patterns of resource allocation to reproduction versus somatic maintenance  Hence it is very likely that adaptation to larval crowing could potentially affect rates of aging through correlated selection for environmental stress resistance and or its effects on adult body size  We addressed this issue by studying a set of large  out bred populations of Drosophila melanogaster  experimentally evolved for adaptation to larval crowding for more than 85 generations in the laboratory conditions  We looked at the adult longevity of flies from both selected and un selected populations when they were grown at different levels of larval density  We found that the selected populations have evolved increased longevity when compared to the control populations  when they were grown in crowded condition but had comparable longevity  when grown under non crowded conditions  Our results indicate the evolution of plasticity of resource allocation to life history traits  such as longevity   
 Sexual selection and sperm competition in a widespread dung fly  Sepsis punctum  Diptera  Sepsidae    Post copulatory sexual selection and sperm competition have been suggested to drive reproductive trait divergence and speciation in various animal groups  Theory predicts that males have limited resources to invest in reproduction  which they must allocate to mate acquisition as well as insemination and competing for fertilizations  Because adaptations to both episodes of selection may be costly  trade offs are predicted to arise between traits that influence pairing success and those that enhance fertilization success  In recent work  we demonstrate a geographic reversal in sexual size dimorphism  SSD  in the widespread dung fly Sepsis punctum  Diptera  Sepsidae   where males are larger than females in Europe  EU  and females are larger in North America  NA   We find higher female  re  mating rates among EU populations  where larger males acquire more matings and face a high risk of sperm competition  Consequently EU males have not only evolved larger testes and steeper hyper allometry with body size but also longer sperm  In sharp contrast  NA populations display much reduced  if any  effect of body size on those traits  with males producing sperm that is almost half the length in EU  Instead  NA males have a distinctive abdominal courtship display that is completely absent in EU and varies in intensity between eastern and western populations  Finally  a phylo geographic approach using mitochondrial and microsatellites markers recovers distinct clusters that show clear isolation by distance within the continents  Hence  the spatial differentiation in genetic structure  the associated changes in behavior and SSD  coupled with varying intensities of sperm competition  suggest a shift in mating systems and incipient speciation in this species  
Evolution of immune response in Drosophila melanogaster populations selected against a gram negative bacteria  Immunity is a costly trait and is often observed to trade off with other costly traits  Not only this  ability to mount better immune response against a pathogen is often thought to trade off with ability to resist other pathogens  Phenotypic manipulation experiments using Drosophila melanogaster showed that same populations subjected to various pathogens respond differentially  However  direct empirical evidence that validate whether evolved resistance against one pathogen would provide resistance against other unrelated pathogens or not is lacking  We subjected this idea to populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolved for better survivorship against a gram negative pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila  In our study  replicate populations of Drosophila melanogater were subjected to three selection regimes   I  Infected with bacteria   S  Sham   infected  injured with needle dipped in MgSO4  and U  Unhandled controls   After 30 generations of selection  we obImmunity is a costly trait and is often observed to trade off with other costly traits  Not only this  ability to mount better immune response against a pathogen is often thought to trade off with ability to resist other pathogens  Phenotypic manipulation experiments using Drosophila melanogaster showed that same populations subjected to various pathogens respond differentially  However  direct empirical evidence that validate whether evolved resistance against one pathogen would provide resistance against other unrelated pathogens or not is lacking  We subjected this idea to populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolved for better survivorship against a gram negative pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila  In our study  replicate populations of Drosophila melanogater were subjected to three selection regimes   I  Infected with bacteria   S  Sham   infected  injured with needle dipped in MgSO4  and U  Unhandled controls   After 30 generations of selection  we observed that males and females of I  regime had better survivorship against Pseudomonas entomophila compared to S and U populations  We then subjected these populations to two other pathogens   Providencia retgerii  gram negative pathogen  and Staphylococcus succinus  gram positive pathogen  to address whether evolved resistance is general or specific  Interestingly  we found that both males and females of selected I populations survived better than controls when challenged with these pathogens  Also  we observed that I females clear more bacteria compared to controls  However  even though I males showed increased survivorship against both pathogens  we observed a pathogen specific response in terms of their ability to clear bacteria  We conclude that evolved immune response against pathogen selected for  can result in better immune response against multiple pathogens  
Assessment of the subspecies status of Calidris maritima littoralis    Aves  Charidriiformes  Scolopacidae   The Icelandic Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima littoralis represents one member of a poorly understood subspecies complex  Currently  mean differences in morphology define two other subspecies  C  m  belcheri  which breeds in northeastern Canada along the Hudson Bay and James Bay  and C  m  maritima   which breeds along the Arctic coasts elsewhere in northern Canada  Greenland  Svalbard  and Scandinavia to northcentral Siberia  As a circumpolar breeding bird  the Purple Sandpiper could provide an interesting perspective on the evolutionary changes following an expansion of a species northward following the Last Glacial Maxima  Considering the extent of the icesheet in the northern hemisphere during the last Ice Age and the short period since the Last Glacial Maxima  correct attribution of subspecies status within the Purple Sandpiper may either reflect a rapid diversification or an ancestral split of distinct evolutionary lineages which survived in isolation at southern latitudes  Applying a morphometric subspecies criteria  diagnosability by Amadon s Rule  and genetic analysis of five nuclear introns and the mtDNA markers  CO1 and ND2  to geographically diverse breeding populations clarified the subspecies attribution of the Icelandic population  Weak but present diagnosability coupled with low levels of significant genetic divergence indicate a recent morphological differentiation of the Icelandic population from a shared refugia  The genetic data calls into question the subspecies attribution due to a lack of evolutionary relevance in the classification  
Experimental Measures of the Costs of Complexity for Horizontal Gene Transfer  The addition of a gene to a genome  whether by duplication or horizontal gene transfer  imposes energetic and functional costs   Functional costs are predicted to increase with connectivity  protein protein interactions   whether the costs arise from gene mis regulation or from a failure of divergent homologues to make normal protein protein interactions   I will discuss two experimental approaches that we used to disentangle the costs associated with gene misregulation and with protein interaction failure   We used existing plasmid libraries that enabled the transfer into E  coli and overexpression of 4102 E  coli genes  90 S  aureus genes  and 90 V  cholerae genes  and measured the cost of transfer using a combination of pairwise  2 strains  and bulk  4102 strains  competition assays   Our data recapitulate the comparative observation that informational genes are less transferable than other genes  and reveal a strong dependence of the cost of connectivity on the degree of divergence between the transferred and native homologues   The cost of overexpression unexpectedly decreased with connectivity among the non divergent E  coli genes  but increased with connectivity among the most divergent S  aureus genes   Thus  the cost of complexity differed depending on the mechanistic basis of the cost    gene misregulation or protein interaction failure  
Candidate barrier genes between G  firmus and G  pennsylvanicus are concentrated on the X chromosome  Species boundaries are known to be semi permeable  whereas advantageous and neutral alleles can spread through a hybrid zone  genes that contribute to reproductive barriers or local adaptation have restricted gene flow   In previous work we characterized patterns of differential introgression for 125 loci across a hybrid zone between the field crickets  Gryllus firmus and G  pennsylvanicus   Now we have constructed a linkage map using these 125 well characterized loci  together with anonymous ddRAD loci  We used multiplex PCR Illumina sequencing combined with ddRAD data to score 90 offspring from a backcross  F1 male x G  pennsylvanicus female    Of the 50 loci with restricted gene flow across a fine scale transect of the cricket hybrid zone  39 are X linked  9 are tightly linked in LG13 and the remaining 2 are tightly linked in LG2  Of all the X linked loci  only 7 out of 46 do not show an abrupt transition across the hybrid zone   Thus  the diagnostic SNPS that we have identified map to two main regions  a very small region in LG13  9 loci mapping to same position  and the X chromosome   At this point we cannot yet tell if the X linked loci with steep clines are tightly linked  Our results are consistent with the idea that genes on sex chromosomes make a large contribution to reproductive isolation in the early stages of speciation  
Patterns of single cell phylogenies under different evolutionary models of cancer  The current staging system of tumors based on radiology and pathology is inadequate to predict tumor progression and patient survival time  However  if we consider a tumor as a population of single cells  evolutionary analysis may give insight into the underlying process of tumor progression  In this project  the goal is to determine whether the phylogenetic structure of a sample of cells may help classify the tumor stage more accurately  We built an agent base tumor growth model  which allows lineage tracking of single cells  and simulated whole genome sequences based on cell lineages with an infinite site model of substitution  We preformed phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of samples of cells to evaluate whether there was any association between phylogenetic patterns and the metastatic potential of the tumor  Our approach may have potential applications in cancer prognosis and may also provide guidelines for appropriate experimental designs of single cell studies of cancer 
Fine scale sampling reveals discordant patterns of genetic variation in Mojave lizard populations  Genetic variation is the basic currency of evolution  only genetically variable loci are capable of evolutionary change  Despite its importance to evolutionary theory  the forces that maintain genomic patterns of variation in wild populations are loosely understood  Genetic diversity is commonly thought to have a positive relationship with effective population size  but this relationship is confounded by natural selection  Selection is more efficient in larger populations and thus one might expect selected loci  and linked neutral loci  to have greater reductions in genetic diversity in large populations  To address the relationship between population size and genetic diversity  we used fine scale population sampling to measure variation in genetic diversity both intraspecifically among loci and interspecifically among similar lizard species  We sampled two abundant species  zebra tailed lizards and western banded geckos  and two less common species  chuckwallas and desert iguanas  in the Mojave Desert and then measured diversity with mitochondrial and nuclear markers  At neutral loci  the two abundant species had significantly higher levels of gene diversity than the less common species  In particular  we found unprecedented levels of diversity at the Mc1r nuclear protein coding locus in the abundant zebra tailed lizard population  Alternatively  another nuclear marker  RAG1  showed evidence of selection and uniform levels of gene diversity across all four species  High variation at the neutral loci is likely due to large effective population sizes and gene flow  But  the homogeneous levels of variation at RAG1 highlight the fact that genetic diversity does not simply reflect a population s size  Selection may confound estimates of demography from presumably neutral markers  Future studies should utilize next generation sequencing to assess how genomic patterns of variation differ among small and large populations  
Exceptional Levels of Genome Wide Recombination Extends to Novel Species in the Genus Apis  With about 20cM Mb  the Western honey bee  Apis mellifera  exhibits an excessive rate of genome wide recombination  which has attracted significant scientific attention  A recent linkage map in the closely related A  cerana has found similarly high recombination rates and the same conclusion was reached for the more distantly related A  florea  based on limited data from two chromosomes  Here  we report on two complete linkage maps in this genus  extending existing genome wide linkage maps to all three major honey bee clades  Based on genotyped SNPs identified by RAD tag sequencing in single family mapping populations  we present genome wide recombination maps of A  florea and A  dorsata  The results suggest that the high recombination rate is a genus wide trait and Apis mellifera is not the unique  which may be taken as evidence for a single evolutionary transition  However  the maintenance of these high recombination rates also suggest in these divergent species suggests some long term selection on this trait  
Payoffs and Tradeoffs  The genetic architecture of many phenotypic traits is such that genes often contribute to multiple traits  and mutations in these genes can therefore affect multiple phenotypes  These pleiotropic interactions often manifest as tradeoffs between traits where improvement in one property entails a cost in another  The life cycles of many pathogens include periods of growth within a host punctuated with transmission events  such as passage through a digestive tract or a passive stage of exposure in the environment  Populations exposed to such fluctuating selective pressures are expected to acquire mutations showing tradeoffs between reproduction within and survival outside of a host  We selected for individual mutations under fluctuating selective pressures for a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage by alternating selection for increased growth rate with selection on biophysical properties of the phage capsid in high temperature or low pH conditions  Tradeoffs were prevalent when selection acted on a single trait  but payoffs resulted when multiple traits were selected for simultaneously  We employed a molecular dynamics simulation method to determine the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects for three heat shock mutations  All three mutations significantly enhanced the affinities of protein protein interfacial bindings  thereby improving capsid stability  The ancestral residues at the mutation sites did not contribute to protein protein interfacial binding  indicating that these sites acquired a new function  Computational models  such as those used here  may be used in future work as a predictive tool for mutational effects on protein or viral stability  
Mechanical Transgressive Segregation and the Rapid Origin of Trophic Novelty  Hybrid phenotypes often fall within the parental range  However  when traits are complex  hybridization can also generate novel phenotypes  For instance  even when the morphologies of individual musculo skeletal components do not segregate outside the parental range in hybrid offspring  complex functional systems can exhibit emergent phenotypes whose mechanics do exceed the parental values  Within this context  we examined three functional systems in the trophic apparatus of Lake Malawi cichlids  We used these systems to determine how the evolutionary divergence of parental species influences the frequency that hybridization produces mechanics that transgress the parental range  Unlike what has generally been found when genetic mechanisms underlie transgressive segregation of linear phenotypes  the complex mechanical systems of the cichlid trophic apparatus often exhibited greater transgression in crosses between more recently diverged cichlid species  Because hybridization is known to take place in the hundreds of co occurring cichlid species and virtually every lineage we studied has the theoretical capacity to produce hybrids with transgressive mechanics  mechanical transgressive segregation has likely helped shape the exceptional trophic diversity of the Lake Malawi cichlid radiation  
A novel application of proteomics to quantify adaptive responses to sperm competition  Sperm competition  whereby the sperm of multiple males compete to fertilise a given set of ova  is a key selective force shaping the evolution of reproductive traits  Theory predicts that males should strategically allocate both sperm and non sperm components of the ejaculate to maximise chances of success in sperm competition  However  testing these predictions is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing contributions from different males when females mate multiply  In this study we employ a novel application of quantitative proteomics techniques in conjunction with differential stable isotope labelling to quantify strategic ejaculate allocation of competing male bank voles  Myodes glareolus  under sperm competition  This allows us to determine not only the number of sperm transferred by each male  but also to quantify differences in the non sperm portion of ejaculate and the efficacy of the copulatory plug deposited by the first male to mate  
Using full genome sequencing to infer the species tree in Neodiprion sawflies  Hymenoptera  Diprionidae   North American pine sawflies in the genus Neodiprion offer an excellent opportunity to study how host use  behavior and development influence adaptation and speciation  as extensive variation exists in a wide range of ecologically relevant traits among taxa in the genus  However  estimating an accurate species tree for comparative studies has proven difficult in this group  Specifically  recent divergence  i e   incomplete lineage sorting  and interspecific gene flow have complicated previous efforts of species tree inference that utilized a handful of loci  Next generation sequencing now allows the generation multilocus data sets consisting of hundreds to thousands of unlinked loci for phylogenetic inference  which have the potential to provide further resolution to the processes underlying speciation  Here  we generated phylogenomic data from 22 taxa in the N  lecontei species group and related outgroups and used a recently developed reference genome for N  lecontei to guide genome assembly and annotation  We will compare estimates of the species tree using several recently developed approaches for genome scale species tree inference  including  BEAST  with subsampling of loci   MP EST  BFD  and PHYLDOG  as well as a previous estimate of the species tree based on three nuclear genes  We will then propose phylogenetic hypotheses for the N  lecontei species group based on these analyses  An accurate specie tree and the genomic resources generated will provide the foundation for future comparative studies examining genetic convergence of candidate genes underlying phenotypic traits that are the target of adaptive evolution in Neodiprion  
The role of ontogeny in homology statements  case studies from morphology and phylogenomics of pancrustaceans  The study of ontogeny as an integral part of understanding the pattern of evolution dates back over 150 years  but only recently have ontogenetic data been explicitly incorporated into phylogenetic homology statements  I developed approaches to incorporate data both from fossils and development  providing proof of concept that ontogeny does affect morphological phylogenetic reconstructions  This work focused on the Pancrustacea  crustaceans + hexapods   a clade with remarkable morphological disparity  comprising over half the world s described species  over 800 000 in total   Many possible sister group relationships have been proposed  diverging in the Cambrian  The only  and therefore oldest  likely Cambrian crown group pancrustacean fossils are known from spectacular three dimensionally phosphatized larvae from  Orsten  type faunas  with impressively complete developmental sequences  but without unequivocal adult stages   These fossils have spurious placements in a traditional morphological analysis  Conserved synapomorphies in larvae may be overprinted later in development  obscuring phylogenetic signal  Therefore  each semaphoront  discrete larval or adult stage  is considered separately  Increased informativeness from larvae may apply to expressed genes  which promise to resolve deep phylogenetic questions  yet are susceptible to duplication and loss throughout evolution  resulting in trees potentially built from non homologous genes  These alternative genes are expressed at different times in ontogeny  as they frequently play a role in development  Current work extends the semaphoront approach to phylogenomics  by sequencing transcriptomes of multiple semaphoronts of Decapoda  representing a broad sample of both species and metamorphic stages  Preliminary results suggest >50  of genes are differentially expressed between larval and adult semaphoronts within species  supporting the hypothesis of additional homologies in larval expression  which will provide synapomorphies allowing the reconstruction of the correct tree  Inclusion of data from multiple semaphoronts may have broader applications to other phylogenetic problems which may rely on ontogenetically variable homology statements  
Organellar phylogenomics of green plants  Recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational approaches have dramatically changed the equation for balancing depth of taxon sampling and amount of data used for phylogenetic inference  enabling the construction of large genomic level datasets  Using transcriptome data from the One Thousand Plants Initiative  1KP  onekp com  and previously published organellar genomes  we generated nearly complete datasets of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes for 1 300 green plants  The chloroplast genome has long been the workhorse of plant phylogenetics and  due to within individual homogenization and its low levels of recombination  is simpler to analyze than the nuclear genome  Similarly  mitochondrial gene space is relatively easy to isolate and analyze  In addition to presenting the overview of relationships inferred from these two data sources  we will focus on the challenges encountered in assembling and analyzing datasets on this scale  
Do placentation and superfetation facilitate living life in the fast lane  A preliminary field study  Placentation  extensive post fertilization maternal provisioning via integrated materno fetal tissues specialized for nutrient transfer  and superfetation  the ability to carry multiple  overlapping broods that are in different stages of embryonic development  are two complex female life history traits that evolved multiple times throughout the animal kingdom  The repeated evolution of these traits suggests that they convey an adaptive benefit to females  yet these potential benefits remain poorly understood  The  locomotor performance hypothesis  proposes that placentation and superfetation evolved to reduce a female s reproductive burden during gestation  Pollux et al  2009   This might be particularly beneficial to aquatic organisms living in environments characterized by high flow conditions  Here we test the prediction that placental and superfetatious livebearing fish occupy a wider ranger of flow conditions compared to sympatric species that lack placentas and superfetation  We used underwater visual census to study microhabitat use of four sympatric Poeciliid species in Costa Rican rivers  Two of these species  Poeciliopsis retropinna and P  paucimaculata  have well developed placentas and superfetation  The other two species  Poecilia gilli and Brachyrhaphis roseni  lack placentas and superfetation  We observed a strong difference in microhabitat use between these four species  P  gilli and B  roseni inhabit the shallow river margins and isolated side pools where current velocity is low  while P  retropinna and P  paucimaculata are found in a much wider range of current velocities  We propose that placentation and superfetation are life history traits that may have evolved to facilitate the exploitation of a wider ecological  flow  niche  
Differential gene expression in ovarian tissue of sexual vs  asexual freshwater snails  The rate of production of successful new asexual lineages from sexual ancestors is a primary determinant of the threat that sexual populations face from asexual invaders  As such  understanding the maintenance of sexual reproduction in natural populations requires characterization of the largely unstudied proximate mechanisms that underlie transitions to asexual reproduction in otherwise obligately sexual taxa  Here  we make initial strides towards identifying these mechanisms in Potamopyrgus antipodarum  an ancestrally sexual New Zealand freshwater snail distinguished by frequent transitions to asexual reproduction  The coexistence of phenotypically similar and closely related sexual and asexual P  antipodarum allows for powerful direct comparisons between sexual and asexual lineages without the potentially confounding effects of genetic background or population of origin  We used RNA Seq to compare patterns of gene expression in ovarian transcriptomes from a diverse set of reproductively active sexual and asexual Potamopyrgus antipodarum  By characterizing gene expression differences between sexuals and asexuals we can identify candidate loci that are likely involved in and or influenced by transitions to asexuality  Our initial analyses reveal extensive variation in gene expression and hundreds of transcripts expressed in consistently different ways between sexual and asexual P  antipodarum  We also found larger sets of differentially expressed transcripts between asexual lineages than between sexual lineages  Greater variability in expression profiles among asexual lineages may reflect a relaxation of expression demands in the absence of sexual reproduction and or different sets of genetic factors involved with each transition to asexuality in P  antipodarum  We are currently annotating and performing gene ontology enrichment analyses to identify candidate genes for transitions to asexual reproduction  Identifying sets of genes associated with reproductive mode will help illuminate the proximate mechanisms that facilitate frequent transitions to asexual reproduction in P  antipodarum and provide a useful set of genomic resources for other researchers studying the maintenance of sex and evolution of asexuality in natural systems  
Inferring seed dispersal in a linear system  using ABC to knit together disparate marker data sets  Though estimation of gene flow is commonly performed using population level genetic marker data  it is less common to estimate propagule dispersal from these data  In this presentation I will describe an ABC framework that uses demographically realistic individual based models to estimate dispersal kernels in Cakile edentula populations found in their native range along western Atlantic coastlines  Understanding dispersal in this water dispersed species is particularly interesting given its prodigious rate of movement in introduced population systems in western North American and southern and eastern Australia  Estimated kernels will be compared to these historical estimates of movement in the introduced ranges  This work describes one of the few forward time approaches to the simulation step in ABC and it takes advantage of this frameworks flexibility to combine data from multiple sources  In this example  three distinct marker datasets  cpDNA  SSR  and Allozyme  as well as demographic information will be included  
Responses to song playback vary with the vocal performance of both signal senders and receivers  Mating signals of many animal species are difficult to produce and thus should indicate signaler quality  Growing evidence suggests that receivers modulate their behavior in response to signals with varying performance levels  although little is known about if and how responses are affected by receiver attributes  To explore this topic we conducted two experiments with swamp sparrows  Melospiza georgiana  in which we challenged territorial males with playback of songs with trill rates that were natural  digitally reduced  or digitally elevated  control  low  and high performance  respectively   In our first experiment  we found that males responded more aggressively to control songs than to low performance stimuli  that low performance stimuli with the most severe trill rate reductions elicited the weakest aggressive responses  and that the subjects  own trill rates predicted aggressive responses  In our second experiment  we found that male responses to high performance stimuli varied significantly  in ways predicted by two factors  the degree to which we had elevated stimulus performance levels of high performance stimuli  and subjects  own vocal performance levels  Specifically  males were less aggressive towards stimuli for which we had elevated performance levels to higher degrees  and subject males with higher vocal performances themselves responded more aggressively  These findings together offer a novel illustration of how responses to aggressive signals may rely not just on signal attributes  but also on attributes of responding animals themselves  
Tempo and mode of anti bat ultrasound production and sonar jamming in the diverse hawkmoth radiation  Bat insect interactions date back millions of years  and the shared evolutionary history between echolocating bats and nocturnal insects have resulted in a suite of unique defensive strategies  Ultrasound production and hearing are two of the most fundamental strategies that nocturnal insects use as protection against bats  However  no research has comprehensively combined behavioral and phylogenetic data to examine how anti bat ultrasound production  hearing  and jamming have evolved  We recently discovered that large  charismatic hawkmoths produce ultrasound using their genitalia  Here we tested ultrasound production in over 100 species  623 total specimens   and resolve the evolutionary history of hawkmoths by conducting a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of all subfamilies  tribes  and subtribes  We show for the first time  that ultrasound production in hawkmoths serves to jam bat echolocation  and that jamming has evolved at least two independent times in the family  Divergence time analyses that used multiple calibration points  reveals that anti bat ultrasound is a relatively new behavior in large moths that first evolved in the mid late Paleogene   30 Mya  after the radiation of insectivorous bats  Ears in hawkmoths evolved secondarily in at least two lineages that have developed the ability to produce ultrasound  implying that sound production might serve to startle predators  Our combined proximate and ultimate analysis of hawkmoths sheds light on the macroevolution of anti bat ultrasound production in the insect bat arms race   
New perspectives on Sunda Shelf biogeography  The Sunda Shelf is an expansive region of shallow water encompassing many islands  large and small   These islands were united by dry land with the Asian mainland numerous times during the Pleistocene and earlier periods   This historical geographic template once provided a seemingly intelligent model for estimating rates of extinction and processes of community disassembly as land area was reduced by rising sea level   However  recent genetic studies of multiple terrestrial vertebrate groups reveal deep inter island genetic isolation and within island speciation  raising questions regarding past assumptions of a once homogeneous biological community of on the Sunda Shelf   We will discuss the implications of these findings in a context of an improving understanding of the systematics of shrews and rodents in the region  
Divergence along an elevational gradient in Borneo  Elevational gradients and the divergence along them have taken an increasingly prominent role in biogeography because it is along these gradients that the effects of climate change are most readily observed  Typically species along elevational gradients are treated as though they are discrete entities with low and high elevation limits  Yet  a key feature of how species respond to elevational changes in climate and to our understanding how they diverged historically is population genetic structure of species and the gene flow among populations   Here we use chemical  morphological and genetic tools to investigate trap jaw ant populations  genus Odontomachus  along an elevational gradient in Sarawak  Borneo  We use nDNA and mtDNA markers to discern the evolutionary history of low and high elevation populations of what is currently a single named species  Our results indicate that while models suggest many species need to move uphill to track climate change that  at least in our focal species  historic gene flow up and downhill has been relatively reduced  
Ecological competition drives viral host range evolution and adaptation  Competition for resources has long been thought to be a key driver of diversification  In a previous study  we found that competition alone promoted host range expansion in the bacteriophage phi 6  Generalists able to use both the original  standard host and a novel host rapidly increased when the supply of host cells were restricted   These generalists expanded their host range without diminishing their fitness on the standard host and thus competitively excluded   swept   specialists with the ancestral host range  standard host only   However  in one population  both phenotypes coexisted  because generalists used the novel host more often  decreasing competition for the shared standard host  niche partitioning   Using the coexisting generalists and specialists  we initiated a new evolution experiment to test if the presence of a competitor can drive the generalists to adapt to novel faster than evolving alone with only the novel host  Specifically  we evolved the generalist with a competitor  specialist  in sympatry with both hosts  As a control  we evolved the generalist alone in allopatry with only novel host  Generalists evolved in both treatments maintained the same host range but varied in how often they used each host  Allopatric generalists used the standard host significantly less than the sympatric generalists  This can be explained by access to a particular host  even when there is competition for it  and or gene flow with the competitor  which will be estimated in future  Taken together  these experiments show that competition can drive host range expansion and affect host use  
Evolutionary origins and genomic consequences of hybridogenesis in Pogonomyrmex harvester ants  Hybridization between species provides the opportunity for two independently evolving genomes to recombine  which may have both negative consequences when co adapted gene complexes are broken up  as well as positive effects if globally adaptive alleles are able to cross the species boundary   At the same time  hybridization can produce evolutionarily novel reproductive systems  such as sperm dependent parthenogenesis and hybridogenesis  that may reduce genetic homogenization while maximizing the heterotic benefits of producing hybrid progeny   We investigated the evolutionary origins and genomic consequences of hybridogenesis in harvester ants  which must interbreed in every generation to produce sterile hybrid workers yet virtually always produce non hybrid reproductive offspring   Using a combination of RADtag genotyping and comparative transcriptome sequencing  we investigated the ancestry of interbreeding hybridogenetic lineages to test whether they are derived from interspecific hybrid zones and identify their most likely source populations   To assess the role of hybridogenesis in shaping the genomic and fitness consequences of hybridization  we investigated the extent  directionality  timing  and genomic distribution of introgression between lineages   Our results indicate that hybridogenesis is derived from historical hybrid zones between P  barbatus and P  rugosus  with at least two independent origins involving different sub populations of the parental species which became interdependent and then radiated together across the contact zone region   All hybridogenetic lineages show a marked reduction in genetic diversity  suggesting that hybridogenesis may be more likely to evolve in small and isolated populations cut off from populations in allopatry by geography and or range contraction    Despite continually interbreeding  overall genetic exchange between lineages was low  with less than 5  of transcripts indicative of introgression   The introgression that did occur was most consistent with a single pulse of gene exchange when hybridizing populations first came into contact  which ceased once hybridogenesis shifted hybrids from the reproductive to the sterile worker caste   These results suggest that hybridogenetic systems in ants may function as  the best of both worlds   reducing or eliminating the reproductive costs of hybrid ancestry once adaptive alleles have introgressed  while maintaining the non reproductive heterosis advantages of a hybrid workforce over evolutionary time  
Differential gene expression in freshwater snails infected and uninfected with a coevolving trematode parasite  Why sexual reproduction is so common ranks among the most important unanswered questions in evolutionary biology  One possibility is that sex increases the efficacy of adaptive molecular evolution by allowing mutations to be selected independently of genetic background  Potamopyrgus antipodarum  a freshwater snail native to New Zealand  is ideally suited to evaluate this hypothesis because closely related and phenotypically similar sexual and asexual individuals often coexist and compete within natural populations  These features of the P  antipodarum system enable us to make direct and powerful comparisons of patterns of molecular evolution between sexual and asexual conspecifics  Here  we take advantage of the fact that Potamopyrgus antipodarum is frequently infected by a coevolving  locally adapted  and virulent trematode parasite  Microphallus sp   to compare patterns of adaptive evolution in genes that are involved in host immune response to parasite pressure  These genes have been shown to experience strong selection and coevolutionary interactions associated with adaptive evolution in a wide diversity of organisms  making them excellent candidates for testing hypotheses regarding the efficacy of adaptive molecular evolution across reproductive modes  We took initial steps toward evaluating a connection between sex and adaptive evolution by using RNA seq to make gene expression comparisons in field collected P  antipodarum differing in Microphallus infection status  infected vs  uninfected   and then used these comparisons to identify loci likely involved in host response to parasite infection  We included snails collected from three different lake populations to identify loci that might be generally involved in immune response as well as loci that might mediate local adaptation to parasite pressure  In our ongoing analyses  we have identified 370 differentially expressed transcripts between uninfected vs  infected snails  many with putative roles in immune defense response and or function  We will compare a subset of these loci across a wide range of sexual vs  asexual P  antipodarum lineages to evaluate the extent to which sexual reproduction facilitates adaptive molecular evolution  Identification of loci involved in immune response to parasites in natural populations of P  antipodarum will also be of broad interest to many biologists that study the molecular genetic mechanisms that drive coevolution and local adaptation  
Genomic imprints of freshwater transitions in the alewife  Alosa pseudoharengus   Among fishes  ecological transitions into freshwater environments are often associated with episodes of diversification and adaptive radiation  We know little about the genomic modifications that underlie these shifts  Alewives are found in ancestrally anadromous migratory populations and in multiple  independently evolved landlocked populations  allowing us to test for parallel genomic responses to freshwater transitions  In this study  we sequenced gill transcriptomes from two landlocked populations and one anadromous population of alewives  which were experimentally challenged with freshwater and seawater in the laboratory  We then characterized divergence in gene expression between alewife life history forms  We detected divergence in expression of genes with osmoregulatory functions  several of which have diverged in parallel between independently evolved landlocked populations and an anadromous one  However  most genes showing parallel divergence between life history forms were not osmoregulatory  suggesting that a variety of molecular pathways may be under selection in the transition to freshwater  Our analysis identifies osmoregulatory loci and other candidate genes that are implicated in adaptation to exclusively freshwater habitats  
Assembly of the New World oscine passerine fauna  Diversification of lineages is often analyzed at a global scale  which may prevent identification of locally successful lineages that have not diversified impressively from a global perspective   On the other hand  analyzing among lineage patterns of diversification on geographically relevant scales is complicated by dispersal  especially in a group with high dispersal potential such as birds   I take a regional perspective on global diversification dynamics of oscine passerines  by inferring interhemispheric  Old World New World  interchanges  estimating the timing of these dispersal events  and comparing post dispersal net diversification of dispersing lineages   Most lineages arriving in the New World have diversified on a trajectory consistent with a constant rates birth death process with a relatively high extinction fraction   By contrast  several relatively old North American lineages have not diversified at all  and one widely distributed lineage the Emberizoidea has diversified at a rate far exceeding comparably aged New World lineages   These analyses are a crude step toward placing avian diversity into a more realistic geographic context   Even so  they offer significant insights into the evolution of avian diversity  suggesting that more fine grained analyses enabled by more complete and robust phylogenies will offer even better  
 Transcriptomics of the   immortal medusa    Turritopsis dohrnii   Most animals reproduce  age  and die  Turritopsis dohrnii  Cnidaria  Hydrozoa  has escaped this fate  When faced with unfavorable circumstances  the jellyfish of T  dohrnii avoid death by reverting to a younger life cycle stage  the polyp  During the life cycle reversal  cell transdifferentiation occurs  Using a genomic approach  we are trying to identify genes that might be involved in T  dohrnii s transdifferentiation  
Selfing allele favored by male function in experimental populations of Witheringia solanacea in Costa Rica  The evolution of self fertilization is one of the most commonly traversed transitions in flowering plants  with profound implications for population genetic structure and evolutionary potential  We investigated factors influencing this transition using Witheringia solanacea  a predominantly self incompatible species within which self compatible genotypes have been identified   We showed that self compatibility in this species segregates with variation at the S locus as inherited by plants in F1 and F2 generations   To examine reproductive assurance and the transmission advantage of selfing  we placed self compatible and self incompatible genotypes in genetically replicated gardens and monitored male and female reproductive success  as well as selfing rates of self compatible plants  Self compatibility did not lead to increased fruit or seed set  even under conditions of pollinator scarcity  and the realized selfing rate of self compatible plants was less than 10    Self compatible plants had higher fruit abortion rates  consistent with previous evidence showing strong inbreeding depression at the embryonic stage   Although the selfing allele did not provide reproductive assurance under observed conditions  it also did not cause pollen discounting  so the transmission advantage of selfing should promote its spread   Given observed numbers of S alleles and selfing rates  self compatibility should spread even under conditions of exceedingly high initial inbreeding depression   
 Climate change  phylogeography and the future of genetic diversity   One response available to species during periods of rapid climate change is to shift their distributions to track suitable climatic conditions   Predictive models of where species are likely to occur in the future have thus emerged as an important scientific and conservation tool  but deploying these models at the species level may fail to detect important intraspecific variation related to local environmental adaptation or that will provide the raw materials for future evolution   We estimated how much existing genetic diversity is likely to remain by the end of this century  and which aspects of a species  phylogeographic history this represents  for New Zealand forest beetles under different climate change scenarios   Each species  phylogeny was pruned to include just those haplotypes currently present in areas predicted by ecological niche models to remain climatically suitable   Trees resulting from these future haplotype pools were compared against a series of random draws from the full haplotype pool to determine whether genetic diversity will be lost in a random or nonrandom fashion   This provides the opportunity to calculate not just projected loss of genetic diversity  i e  number of haplotypes and genetic distance   but the extent to which this loss obscures a species  evolutionary history  
Congruent phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to testosterone in both sexes implications for the evolution of endocrine mediated sexual dimorphism  Understanding how different phenotypes are produced from the same underlying genome is an important goal of evolutionary biology  Males and females share an autosomal genome  which may constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism  Sex steroids  which are secreted in sex specific fashion  can facilitate the development of sexual dimorphism by differentially regulating the expression of shared autosomal loci  However  it is generally unknown whether the evolution of endocrine mediated sexual dimorphism is achieved primarily through sex differences in circulating hormones  or also through sex specific tissue sensitivity to these hormones  We tested the effect of the sex steroid testosterone  T  on whole organism growth and tissue specific gene expression of the liver  a major integrator of energetics and growth  in males and females of a lizard  Anolis sagrei  with pronounced male biased sexual size dimorphism  In two separate experiments on captive lizards  we administered either testosterone or placebo implants to  1  intact males and females at the age  5 6 mo  when sexual dimorphism first becomes pronounced  and  2  intact females and castrated males at an age  10 11 mo  when developmental trajectories are highly divergent between the sexes  T shifted both sexes toward a male specific pattern of development by stimulating growth  bone elongation  resting metabolic rate  and utilization of fat reserves  The transcriptome of the liver was similarly impacted by T  which shifted both sexes towards a male specific pattern of gene expression that included upregulation of insulin like growth factor  IGF 1   Our results suggest that the evolution of endrocrine mediated sexual dimorphism in growth and body size is achieved primarily through sex differences in circulating androgen levels  rather than through a reduction in sensitivity of females to androgens  
Intrahost HIV Evolution During Early Infection  During HIV infection  immune response in the form of cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTLs  creates a selective force on the infecting HIV population   HIV escape from this CTL mediated selection is complex and poorly understood  but occurs rapidly and throughout infection   In this talk  I will discuss some recent work focused on quantifying the strength of selection exerted by CTLs during early HIV infection    
SNP differentiation and differential gene expression in endemic Epischura baikalensis from Lake Baikal  Lake Baikal  extremely diverse in benthic life  has a remarkably uniform zooplankton  with over 95  of biomass represented by just one species of an endemic calanoid copepod  Epischura baikalensis Sars  This species  arguably the most abundant of all freshwater multicellular animals  due to Baikal s volume  is a pivotal primary consumer of pelagic algal production  Despite a significant current mixing  it is excluded form Baikal s shallow  warmer bays  populated by cosmopolitan zooplankton  which is  in turn  until recently was very rare in the open Baikal  We obtained a partial transcriptome of E  baikalensis and investigated genetic differentiation of SNP frequencies and gene expression profiles between samples taken in different parts of Baikal  The first two principle components describing both SNP differentiation and differential expression are correlated with the latitudinal gradient and with the distinction between Maloe More straight and the main body of the lake  Genes that are most differentiated at SNPs also tend to have the most divergent expression profile  We discuss these findings in the light of plastic and selection response of Baikal Epischura to current and future increases of surface temperatures in Baikal  
Genetics of polymorphic male male copulatory behavior in C  elegans  We investigated a natural model for sexually antagonistic pleiotropy  male sexual behavior in the nematode C  elegans  In this species  the recent origin of hermaphroditism has relaxed selection on male function  allowing for the evolution of traits that are beneficial for hermaphrodites but detrimental to male fitness  We find substantial genetic variation for male male sexual behavior in C  elegans  In some strains  males copulate with one another and deposit copulatory plugs on one anothers excretory pores  We find that this phenotype is genetically complex but strongly influenced by a QTL that has a large effect in particular backgrounds  We mapped the major effect locus to a single nucleotide polymorphism in a previously uncharacterized gene  This loss of function allele increases the attractiveness of the male excretory pore to other males  The affected gene is expressed in the one cell renal system of both males and hermaphrodites  suggesting that its effect on males may be countered by an effect on hermaphrodite fitness  
Genotype by Diet Interactions underlying Metabolomic Variation in Drosophila  Diseases linked to Metabolic Syndrome  MetS  such at type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are rapidly increasing in humans due to the influences of a modern Westernized life style  but the genetic  environmental  and physiological mechanisms linking the symptoms of MetS remain to be elucidated   Previously  we have shown that that there is a very substantial contribution of genotype by environment interactions to the phenotypic variation observed for MetS like symptoms in a naturally genetically variable population of D  melanogaster   A major question in evolutionary biology is how can a maladaptive genetic trait like MetS affect such a large proportion of a population without being lost due to selection    Has a shift in environment facilitated the exposure of cryptic genetic variation for a maladaptive trait   We address this question by explicitly testing the genotype by diet interaction effect on metabolomic variation in the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource genetic mapping population   We have mapped QTLs for the genotype by diet interaction effects in MetS like phenotypes  e g  body weight  triglyceride storage  blood sugar   as well as for metabolomic profiles    Generally we find that the QTLs for main the genetic effects are different from those mediating the genotype by diet interactions  and that each trait has a unique set of QTLs   We are finding both new and expected candidate genes as being associated with these metabolic traits   
From fast to ultrafast  the evolutionary dynamics of mantis shrimp power amplification  Mantis shrimp use a potent biomechanical combination of springs  linkages and latches to power their fast raptorial appendages  Most mantis shrimp species are fish catching spearers  2 6 m s  103 m s2  3 25 ms   yet one group shifted to ultrafast shell smashing  16 30 m s  105 m s2  
 Genes  mice and Vikings   The species Mus musculus has a natural distribution in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and the Near East  However  it also found throughout the rest of the world courtesy of humans  The English vernacular name for the species is  house mouse  and it is because the species is able to utilise the food of humans and their livestock  and live in man made dwellings  that they are able to live in all parts of the world  But it is of course their ability to get onto boats as stowaways that has transported house mice everywhere  This transport of mice has been going on for the past 12 000 years  By comparing the DNA sequences of house mice from different parts of the species distribution  it is possible to infer the history of transportation of the house mice  Mice from the source area of a particular colonisation will have similar DNA sequences to mice from the colonised location  Judging by these DNA comparisons many of the house mouse colonisations are just as would be predicted from our knowledge of the human history  I will illustrate this by describing inferred mouse colonisations that match well described Viking spheres of influence in the North Atlantic region  Mice also provide evidence for some undocumented Viking movements  suggesting that they may be a valuable proxy for human history  Studies up to now have been largely based on mitochondrial D loop sequences  but there is considerable potential for studies with genomic data   which are in progress  
Genetics of host regulation of maternal microbial transmission  Many animals maternally transmit microbial symbionts in the face of profound fitness consequences should symbiont titers go awry  making host regulation of inherited microbes crucial  However  little is known about the evolution of host genes involved in symbiont titer control or the molecular mechanisms by which this regulation is achieved  In Nasonia parasitoid wasps  interspecific transfer of the Wolbachia bacterial symbiont wVitA from its resident host  N  vitripennis  to a closely related but na•ve host  N  giraulti  results in a nearly 100 fold increase in infection titers  We have determined that a maternal effect acts dominantly in N  vitripennis to massively suppress Wolbachia titers and establish the native infection level in resulting offspring  Thus  we sought to identify the host genetic factors that underlie this symbiont regulation using genetic tools available to Nasonia  including introgression  genotyping microarrays  quantitative trait loci analyses and RNA seq  We report four key findings   i  Two genomic regions  one each on chromosomes 2 and 3  out of the five Nasonia chromosomes   have a major effect on the maternal suppression trait   ii  These two regions act additively to reduce titers by more than 80  compared to N  giraulti controls   iii  RNA seq of Nasonia ovaries identified several genes located within our candidate regions that are differentially expressed between N  vitripennis and N  giraulti   iv  One of these candidate genes  a lysosome associated membrane glycoprotein  appears to be under positive selection  Together  these results suggest that tight control of maternal microbial transmission may have a relatively simple genetic basis in Nasonia that has evolved since the divergence of the two Nasonia species approximately 1 MYA  
High throughput sequencing characterization of meiofaunal communities in northern Gulf of Mexico  Metagenomic approaches are widely used to examine prokaryotic community composition  but less often applied to eukaryotic organisms   Studies employing these approaches to study eukaryotic communities have mainly used the 454 platform  We have been using a novel high throughput Illumina sequencing approach to characterize meiofaunal community composition within the Gulf of Mexico  GOM    Meiofauna  which comprise animals less than 1mm living between sediment grains  are important in food webs and nutrient exchange between the benthos and water column  These animals were dramatically affected by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in both intertidal and subtidal locations   Unfortunately  knowledge of seasonality and variability of meiofaunal communities in most of the GOM is lacking   Previous research exploring meiofauna variation in this geographic region has used traditional methods of sieving and microscopy to taxonomically identify individuals   This method requires experts to properly identify organisms and  therefore  researchers typically focus on a few taxonomic groups within meiofauna  limiting the ability of studies to be extrapolated across the community   To better understand the spatial and temporal variation in GOM meiofaunal communities a whole  high throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the eukaryotic specific hypervariable V9 region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA  SSU rRNA  gene was employed to examine intertidal and subtidal communities   Results show that high throughput sequence approaches proved useful in examining the meiofauna community composition in the GOM   This approach can detect clear changes and differences in community composition over both spatial and temporal scales   In addition  this research provides a fundamental baseline to examine community impacts of future natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico region and suggests the community shifts seen in sites impacted by the spill cannot be attributed to seasonal or geographic variability  
A birds eye view of habitat fragmentation  comparing the effects at ecological and evolutionary timescales in two sister species  Habitat loss and fragmentation is considered to be one of the greatest threats to biodiversity today  As habitats become more fragmented  populations become more isolated as gene flow between them decreases  We used microsatellites to examine the effects of habitat fragmentation at two different timescales  ecological and evolutionary  We compare genetic structure of brown headed nuthatches  Sitta pusilla   which occupy  formerly contiguous  pine forests of the southeastern US that have been fragmented on an ecological timescale  to their closely related sister species  pygmy nuthatches  S  pygmaea   Pygmy nuthatches occupy ponderosa pine forests in sky islands of western North America and have been fragmented on evolutionary timescales  We genotyped 290 brown headed nuthatches from 12 Florida populations and 120 pygmy nuthatches from 11 populations throughout their range  Although we would expect to see much greater structure in pygmy nuthatch populations due to the large geographic range sampled and presumably greater isolation  that was not the case  Instead  analyses indicate similar genetic structure between the two species  We test several hypotheses  both biological and artefactual  to explain our observations  including higher than expected rates of dispersal or by recent postglacial expansion of a large population into the present range with insufficient time for divergence  Alternatively  the low level of structuring in pygmy nuthatches could be an artefact of the lower sample sizes for this species  
Shifts in the Expression of Developmental Regulatory Genes Involved in the Evolution of a Novel Life History Difference  Developmental mode can influence dispersal  gene flow  speciation and extinction rates in marine taxa and thus can have important consequences for micro  and macroevolutionary processes  While the ancestral developmental mode of sea urchins is indirect through a feeding larval stage  planktotrophic   non feeding development  lecithotrophic  has evolved independently multiple times  In order to identify evolutionary changes in gene expression underlying this ecologically significant shift in life history  we used Illumina RNA seq to measure expression dynamics across 6 developmental stages in three sea urchin species  the lecithotroph Heliocidaris erythrogramma  the closely related planktotroph Heliocidaris tuberculata  and an out group planktotroph Lytechinus variegatus   Our analyses draw on a well characterized developmental gene regulatory network  GRN  in sea urchins to understand how the ancestral developmental program was altered during the evolution of lecithotrophic development  Our results suggest that changes in gene expression profiles were more numerous during the evolution of lecithotrophy than during the persistence of planktotrophy  and this contrast is even stronger when only GRN genes are considered  We found evidence for both conservation and divergence of GRN linkages in H  erythrogramma  as well as significant changes in the expression of genes with known roles in patterning the larval skeleton and gut  which are greatly modified in lecithotrophs  Collectively  these results indicate that the transition from planktotrohpic to lecithotrophic development involved numerous changes to key developmental processes   
Developmental integration of an obligate intracellular symbiont  Vertically transmitted symbionts are both developmentally and metabolically integrated into their hosts to generate the holosymbiont  In most systems remarkably little is known about the mechanisms mediating holosymbiont integration   Recently  facilitated by functional characterization and localization of amino acid transporter ApGLNT1  Price  Wilson and colleagues proposed a model of endosymbiosis regulation whereby amino acid biosynthesis in the holosymbiont is regulated by a symbiont synthesized end product   By tracking the expression and protein localization of ApGLNT1 during asexual female embryogenesis we gain insight into the developmental and metabolic integration of the pea aphid  Acyrthosiphon pisum and its endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola   In doing so  we find that the intracellular symbionts of asexual female pea aphids commence amino acid provisioning after birth and not before  
Horizontal Gene Transfer between Schistosomes and their Hosts   Horizontal gene transfer  HGT   the movement of genetic material between distinct evolutionary lineages  has long been known as a principal force of diversification and adaptation of prokaryotes   More recently  molecular data have increasingly contributed to the identification of possible gene transfers among various metazoan phyla  e g   Porifera  Cnidaria  Nematoda  Arthropoda  Rotifera  and Craniata    Although the exact mechanism of eukaryotic HGT is often unknown  host parasite interactions provide ample opportunities for HGT   Schistosomes  trematode parasites with complex life cycles  have been repeatedly implicated in HGT   We employed molecular and bioinformatic approaches to critically analyze published reports of HGT between schistosomes and their hosts to better understand the evolution of eukaryotic genomes   Our research suggests that reported cases of schistosome associated HGT may be due to technical artifacts  e g   contamination  as opposed to biological reality   Thus  we emphasize the importance of multiple lines of evidence to conclusively document HGT  
Absolute Brain Volume and Dietary Breadth Predict Species Differences in Self Control  A broad comparative approach has yielded advances in diverse areas of evolutionary biology  yet studies of animal cognition have typically focused on describing the cognitive skills of one or a few species  This approach has yielded progress toward identifying the proximate mechanisms of cognition in model species  but at the cost of having low power to test hypotheses about how and why cognition evolves  I will present data from a large scale collaboration investigating cognitive skills for self control in 36 species of mammals and birds   Using this dataset we explored the leading hypotheses for how and why cognition evolves  Phylogenetic analyses revealed that absolute brain volume was a robust predictor of species differences in self control  and explained considerably more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass  This result complements recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume   Within primates  dietary breadth was a significant predictor of skills for self control  whereas social group size was not  Collectively  our results implicate robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth  absolute brain volume  and cognitive skills for self control  
Pollen competition in style  Is bigger always better   Most flowering plants are hermaphroditic and can gain fitness through both male  pollen  and female  ovule  functions   While mechanisms underlying the variation in female fitness  often measured as seed production  have been studied extensively  ones that influence variation in male fitness  pollen siring success  remain poorly understood  resulting in a biased towards using female fitness for evolutionary interpretation in many cases  This study aims to understand the causes and patterns of variation in male fitness by focusing on the influence of one of the male traits   pollen size   Specifically  by taking this  bottom up  approach this study will examine the relationship between pollen size and variation in male fitness   Pollen size varies greatly among different angiosperms species  diameter ranges from 5   250   but is often considered to have little variation within a species  presumably due to a strong selection for the optimal pollen size for specific pollination conditions in each species   However  similar to several recent studies  we found that significant phenotypic and genetic variation still exist within and among natural populations of the common morning glory  Ipomoea purpurea  making it a suitable system for this study   In the current study  we test the hypothesis that variation in pollen size  presumably an index of pollen quality  will lead to variation in male fitness   We generated plants with divergent pollen sizes using an artificial selection approach   In a pollen competition experiment  we found that genotypes with larger pollen sizes sired significantly more ovules than those with smaller pollen sizes   We also investigated whether differential pollen tube growth rates were responsible for this pattern   Results will be discussed in the context of sexual selection in flowering plants  
Horizontal transfer and size evolution in yeast mitochondrial genomes  Mitochondrial  mt DNA recombination not only takes place within species  but also takes place between different species  which is often referred as horizontal gene transfer  HGT   HGT in mtDNA has not been systematically studied in yeast  Based on our previous findings that recurrent mtDNA recombination has occurred in various intronic regions of the 21S rRNA between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a subset of Torulaspora strains  we took a whole genome sequencing approach and sequenced the mtDNAs of eight Torulaspora strains in four species pairs  Our results observed horizontal transfer in a majority of mitochondrial introns  which opens the door to questions on whether mtDNA HGT is indeed frequent in yeast  but has largely been overlooked  We also observed evidence of small scale horizontal transfer in the protein coding regions  raising the question on whether HGT plays a significant role in altering mitochondrial protein coding capacity in yeast  Furthermore  there is a significant genome size variation among these yeast mitochondrial genomes  which would serve an excellent model system to study the evolution of genome complexity  In recent years  the mutation burden  MB  hypothesis has emerged as a potentially unifying explanatory framework arguing for a central role for nonadaptive processes such as mutation and drift in the evolution of genome size and complexity  Among these variable  but also closely related  mitochondrial genomes  we will discuss the possible evolutionary processes that introns  AT rich sequences  and GC clusters act together to drive the evolution of yeast mitochondrial complexity  
Quantification of Coiling Patterns in Gastropod Shells and Evaluation of Functional Traits  The morphology of gastropod shells has been a focus of analyses in evolution  It has recently emerged as an important issue in developmental biology  thanks to recent advancements in molecular biological techniques  The growing tube model is a theoretical morphological model for describing various coiling patterns of molluscan shells  It is a useful tool to relate local tissue growth with global shell morphology  However  the growing tube model has hardly been adopted in empirical research owing to the difficulty in estimating the parameters from morphological data  In this talk  I attempt to solve this problem by developing methods of parameter estimation when 1  3D Computed Tomography  CT  data are available and 2  only 2D image data  such as photographs  are available  When 3D CT data are available  the parameters can be estimated by fitting an analytical solution of the growing tube model to the data  When only 2D image data are available  we first fit Raup s model to the 2D image data and then convert the parameters of Raup s model to those of the growing tube model  Both methods work well  except when shells grow without coiling  Moreover  I attempt to evaluate functional traits of gastropod shells  In this talk  I focus on defensive traits against invading predators  e g  giant water bugs and larvae of firefly   I proposed three indexes to evaluate those  length of growing trajectory  change of curvature  and shapes of tube slices  These traits can be evaluated from either growing tube model or 3D CT data  I would like to discuss what kinds of traits are helpful to understand morphological diversity of gastropods and their shell forms  
The Genetic Basis of Natural Aridity Tolerance in Anopheles gambiae   A large inversion on chromosome 2L of the malaria vector  Anopheles gambiae  is associated with a latitudinal cline in aridity in Cameroon  High frequencies of the inverted karyotype are present in northern  arid regions and almost absent in southern  humid regions  In populations at middle latitudes the inversion is at intermediate frequencies  Some nucleotide polymorphisms within the inversion that are fixed for alternative alleles at either end of the cline show patterns suggesting substantial amounts of gene flux between the alternative arrangements in the central region  Populations from the central region may therefore represent a unique opportunity to apply association mapping to an inversion  Here  we use a pooled genome wide association study  Pool GWAS  approach to fine scale map the genomic loci contributing to natural variation in aridity tolerance  We examine aridity tolerance phenotypes in thousands of individuals of A  gambiae from the center of the cline  We pool individuals by phenotype high aridity tolerance and low aridity tolerance and divided each phenotype pool by inversion arrangement  For each combination of karyotype and phenotype  two replicates are used  We sequenced each replicate at approximate 20X coverage  and tested polymorphic variants for associations with aridity tolerance  We identify 95 SNPs showing significant associations with aridity tolerance variation in all four pools  31 of these SNPs are mapped within 24 protein coding genes  some of which are promising candidates for proteins contributing to aridity tolerance  
Introgression of the allele for red fruit color from cultivated to wild papaya through feral intermediates  Red fruit color in cultivated papaya is the result of a 2bp loss of function insertion in the coding region of the beta lycopene cyclase gene that normally regulates the conversion of lycopene  red  to beta carotene  yellow    In order to address the origin of this allele  we sample genetic diversity at the beta lycopene cyclase locus in a survey of red fruited and yellow fruited cultivars  wild papaya populations in Costa Rica  and feral individuals within the same region   We found a strong signature of positive selection in red cultivars the form of a selective sweep spanning over 100kb  consistent with selection for this allele in red cultivars during papaya domestication   Furthermore  we found that while the red allele exists at 
Evolution and host manipulation of Nasonia venom  Parasitoid wasps are abundant and ecologically important predators that inject venom into and then lay their eggs on other insects  Parasitoids vary in the hosts they utilize  flies  beetles  butterflies  etc   the life stage they parasitize  eggs  larvae  pupae   With their diverse life histories  parasitoid venom has evolved mechanisms for manipulating host immunity  physiology  and behavior in ways that enhance the development of parasitoid young  yet virtually nothing is known about the diversity or function of individual parasitoid venom proteins  A model ectoparasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis has at least 79 different venom proteins  of which 24 have no sequence similarity to any known proteins  Given the incredible diversity of parasitoids  their venoms represent an immense and untapped potential resource for novel traits  Here we investigate the diversity and evolution of venom proteins in different parasitoid wasps using proteomes and transcriptomes to evaluate four Nasonia species in order to assess how venom proteins are recruited and lost among closely related species  We have found rapid turnover of venom proteins among the four species  Additionally  we used a transcriptomic approach to measure changes in gene expression in stung and unstung hosts  Sarcophaga bullata  Diptera  following envenomation by N  vitripennis  The results indicate that venoms target very specific aspects of host gene expression with 
The role of genetic drift in the maintenance of sexual reproduction in an artificial gene network model  Though sexual reproduction is nearly ubiquitous in nature  its costs are substantial  Foremost among these costs are the twofold cost of males and the cost of destroying successful genetic associations  Understanding the persistence of sex despite these detriments is a central question in evolutionary biology  Recent theoretical investigations of the benefits of sex have focussed on scenarios in which recombination eliminates linkage disequilibrium that accumulates due to genetic drift  Drift increases the probability that the fit  unmutated genotype will be stochastically lost and that deleterious mutations will become fixed in the population  By destroying linkage disequilibrium  sex hastens the removal of deleterious mutations from the population and prevents loss of the fit ancestral genotype  Previous computational investigations have supported this hypothesis  demonstrating greater than twofold benefits of sex arising from genetic drift in structured populations   However  these models did not incorporate interactions between mutations  so sexual populations did not experience one of the major costs of sex  the cost of destroying successful genetic combinations   Here we examine the consequences of genetic interactions for the evolution of sex in structured populations  We use a computational model of a regulatory gene network in which each gene regulates other genes  and these interactions determine a phenotype  These gene networks exist as individuals which undergo mutation  selection and reproduction in an evolving population  Previous work has shown the distribution of mutational effects evolves in this model due to changes in the genetic architecture  which evolves differently in sexual and asexual populations   In this work  we simulate evolution towards a target phenotype in a subdivided population  under conditions which will cause varying degrees of genetic drift and thus  linkage disequilibrium  We find that fitness evolves in both sexual and asexual populations  reaching an equilibrium after an initial period of rapid evolution  Increased levels of genetic drift decrease the maximum fitness an evolving population reaches in both populations  However  we find no evidence under any conditions that sexual populations evolve to have a higher fitness than asexual populations  The recombination load experienced by sexual populations in our experiments was not sufficient to explain the complete absence of an advantage to sex in our experiments   Rather  an unanticipated impact of genetic interactions on drift load seems to explain this major difference between our experiments and those of Hartfield et al  2010  2012    Our results emphasize the need to consider genetic interactions in investigations of the evolution of sex     
Mate choice in European badgers  Meles meles   females choose males from neighbouring groups that have similar MHC  The major histocompatibility complex  MHC  plays a crucial role in the acquired immune system  It can be a target of mate choice  used to maximize offspring fitness  potentially mediated by olfactory cues  Under the genetic compatibility hypothesis  individuals are predicted to choose mates with maximal or optimal MHC divergence  to enhance the resistance of their offspring to pathogens  Studies of MHC based mate choice in wild mammals are under represented currently  and few investigate more than one class of MHC genes  Here we investigated mate choice based on the compatibility of MHC class I genes and MHC class II DRB genes in a wild population of group living European badgers  Meles meles   We also investigated mate choice based on microsatellite derived pairwise relatedness  to distinguish MHC specific effects from genome wide effects  Using 6 years of data  overall we found MHC assortative mating for neighboring group  but not within group parent pairs  with yearly variations  This effect was due entirely to similarity at MHC class II DRB loci  Neighboring group parent pairs had similar DRB amino acid distances for both the entire exon 2 sequences and the antigen binding site  ABS  in isolation  Our randomizations showed no evidence of genome wide based inbreeding  based on 35 microsatellite loci  MHC class II DRB similarity was therefore the apparent target of mate choice  We propose that MHC based mating studies should account for the class of MHC genes examined  mating system characteristics  and inter annual variations  
A tradeoff between natural and sexual selection underlies evolution of sexual signal diversity in Bahamas mosquitofish  It has long been assumed that conspicuous  brightly colored traits are subject to tradeoffs between natural and sexual selection  but surprisingly few empirical investigations of this hypothesis exist  We directly tested this notion in a model system for adaptive diversification  livebearing Bahamas mosquitofish  Gambusia hubbsi  inhabiting blue holes across Andros Island  Male G  hubbsi possess bright orange dorsal fins that they display during female courtship and male male competition  The degree of fin coloration has evolved differences between populations isolated in the presence or absence of a piscivorous fish  Gobiomorus dormitor  for thousands of years  We constructed 3D printed model replicas of male G  hubbsi and painted them to exhibit the average fin color of males found in low predation  more colorful fins  or high predation  less colorful fins  populations  We paired high  and low predation models to test for a tradeoff between natural and sexual selection using in situ predator trials in blue holes and lab based female mate choice trials  Predatory fish approached and spent more time inspecting more colorful models than less colorful models  suggesting that bright orange dorsal fins are more conspicuous to predators  Virgin female G  hubbsi born in the lab spent more time associating with the more colorful model fish  with significant heritability for female preference  Thus  our study provides much needed empirical evidence supporting a tradeoff between natural and sexual selection for a conspicuous sexual signal      
Tinkering with the axial skeleton  vertebral number variation in ecologically divergent threespine stickleback populations  Understanding how the vertebral column is impacted as populations adapt to different habitats favoring distinct body forms can provide insight into the origin of evolutionary diversity in the axial skeleton  We examine variation of vertebral number and body shape in morphologically and ecologically divergent threespine stickleback populations from Alaska  Variation in vertebral number was substantial and was associated with body shape variation  Both vertebral homeosis and region specific changes in vertebral number were present  Sexual dimorphism in vertebral number was significant and resulted from vertebral homeosis  females had more abdominal vertebrae and males more caudal vertebrae  but total vertebrae did not differ  Body elongation was associated with an increase in vertebral number  especially in the caudal region  although this varied among populations  Variation among individuals indicated that external similarity in body form masks significant vertebral variation in stickleback  Although more research on the underlying mechanisms and functional significance is needed  our findings highlight the potential of the threespine stickleback as a model for studying the evolution of the vertebrate axial skeleton  
An intraspecific gradient from C3 to C4 photosynthesis  During the diversification of flowering plants  C4 photosynthesis evolved independently from C3 ancestors more than 60 times  but the details of how this happened remain poorly understood  Studies to decipher the transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis often infer the nature of these changes across distantly related species  differing by many traits  which subsequently can only evaluate a limited number of steps during the C3 to C4 transition  Here  we analyze the variation in C4 related traits that exists within a single species  the grass Alloteropsis semialata  Some populations of this species use C3 photosynthesis  while others use the C4 pathway   Intriguing reports in the literature point to intermediate states  but these have never been confirmed nor extensively characterised  We developed a multidisciplinary research program to understand the causes and consequences of this variation  toward an elucidation of the processes that lead to novel ecological adaptations  First  13C isotope data for 300 individuals across the species  range show the C3 and C4 physiological states are not discrete but form a continuum between pathways  suggesting the existence of C3 C4 intermediacy  Physiological data were combined with immunolocalization results to decipher the degree of this intermediacy  The 13C continuum was analyzed in a spatio ecological context  Populations using C3 and C4 photosynthesis inhabit different  but overlapping  geographic ranges and C3 C4 intermediate populations are only found in the overlapping region  Analyses of markers from chloroplast and nuclear genomes show that the C3 and C4 clades form two ancient and well diversified sister groups and intermediates are nested in several places within the C3 clade  suggesting multiple transitions to C3 C4 intermediate photosynthesis from the pool of C3 ancestors  possibly via hybridization  Leaf anatomy measurements show some traits  e g   mesophyll cell abundance  change abruptly across the 13C spectrum  while others   e g   interveinal distance  form a continuum and the environmental drivers behind this variation are presented  Additionally  the environmental inducibility of each anatomical trait is described to confirm the degree to which plasticity may be influencing the evolution of photosynthesis in this species  The anatomical and physiological continua are discussed in light of the species phylogeography and plasticity for C4 anatomy  shedding new light on C4 evolution among populations of the same species  By comparing such closely related individuals that represent a continuum of photosynthetic states  we illustrate the small changes that accumulate over time to generate C4 photosynthesis  one of the most successful ecological innovations in flowering plants  
 SimPhy  Comprehensive simulation of gene  locus and species trees at the genome wide level   We present SimPhy  a new fast and flexible simulation tool to simulate gene family evolution with incomplete lineage sorting  ILS   gene duplication and loss  GDL  and horizontal gene transfer  HGT  at the genome wide level  The core of this new tool is a generative model based on the recently coined 3 tree paradigm  species tree  locus tree and gene tree  SimPhy has been explicitly designed to implement comprehensive realistic simulation scenarios  with several sources of branch length heterogeneity  A typical SimPhy simulation study is first parameterized with a certain number of species tree replicates and prior distributions for the species tree simulation  including birth and death rates  number of individuals per species  ingroup outgroup distance  generation time  population size and related sources of heterogeneity   locus tree simulation  including number of gene families  birth  death and transfer rates and locus specific rate heterogeneity  and gene tree simulation  including gene tree branch specific rate heterogeneity  Then SimPhy starts the simulation of species  locus and gene trees  sampling the parameters from prior statistical distributions  and generating trees  reconciliations and sequences  the latter using Indelible   saving all the information directly to a database  Thus  SimPhy could be used not only to perform classical grid like simulation studies  accepting fixed parameters  but more importantly  is able to generate simulations under continuous parameter landscape  SimPhy could be used to study the interaction between the processes that generate species tree   gene tree incongruence and to perform thorough evaluations of phylogenomic methodologies  
Patterns of amino acid sequence evolution across various time scales in the mitochondrial genomes of sexual and asexual snails  Understanding how mutations affect phenotype is of paramount importance in evolutionary biology but remains poorly understood in all but a few model systems  A particularly interesting setting in which to evaluate genotype phenotype connections is provided by asexual vs  sexual organisms  asexual lineages are expected to exhibit accelerated deleterious mutation accumulation relative to sexual counterparts  While a number of asexual taxa have been shown to accumulate putatively harmful mutations more rapidly than related sexuals  it is still unclear whether mutation accumulation affects fitness enough to contribute to the evolutionary maintenance of sex or asexual lineage extinction  Because amino acid sequence represents a primary measure of phenotypic function  we can generate important inferences about genotype phenotype connections and thus the consequences of mutation accumulation by evaluating the rates and patterns of amino acid sequence evolution  Here  we compared the rate of radical nonsynonymous evolution  i e   amino acid changes between biochemical groups  to the rate of conservative nonsynonymous evolution  i e   amino acid changes within biochemical groups  in the mitochondrial genomes of seven sexual and 24 asexual lineages of Potamopyrgus antipodarum  a freshwater snail in which sexuals and asexuals coexist and compete  We performed these comparisons at relatively long  divergence data   intermediate  polymorphism and divergence data   and relatively short  polymorphism data  time scales  which allowed us to evaluate how the rates and patterns of these mutations change across time  We found that the rate of conservative substitution is significantly higher than that of radical substitution  that radical mutations are significantly less likely to contribute to divergence than conservative mutations  and that radical polymorphisms exist at similar frequencies as conservative polymorphisms within P  antipodarum  These results indicate that conservative nonsynonymous mutations are substantially less harmful than radical mutations  suggesting that treating all nonsynonymous mutations as a single  monolithic class may be inappropriate  but also indicate that the evolutionary differences between radical and conservative mutations are not apparent at relatively short time scales  Furthermore  asexual P  antipodarum appeared to exhibit higher rates of conservative  but not radical  substitution than their sexual counterparts  consistent with the hypothesis that reduced efficacy of purifying selection in the absence of sex should result in an increased rate of accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations  
Directional Selection on Aposematic Coloration in the Dyeing Poison Frog  Dendrobates tinctorius   Aposematic  warning  coloration is a defensive strategy found throughout the animal kingdom  The phenomenon relies on frequency dependence of an aposematic signal for local predators to learn and associate the signal with unpalatability  Theory predicts that more common signals  morphs  should be favored against novel forms  Previous research supports the role of purifying selection on phenotype  consistent with current evolutionary theory  Many aposematic species  however  display polytypism  interpopulation variation   which is counterintuitive  Here we studied how signal polytypism may evolve in the Dyeing Poison Frog  Dendrobates tinctorius   This species is found throughout the Guiana Shield of South America and exhibits a wide variety of color and pattern combinations  We examined predator response to novel colors and patterns by placing plasticine clay models in two different sites in French Guiana where color but not pattern differ  Models placed in each area had either the local color and pattern  local color and novel pattern  or local pattern and novel color  At one site  avian predators attacked the local morph more often than expected by chance  but had equal avoidance of all models in our second site  These results suggest directional selection towards a more efficient aposematic signal  This provides a mechanism for novel signals to evolve and be pushed to a new signal optimum  which could explain how polytypism may evolve in aposematic species  
Dissecting the physiological basis of allochronic isolation in Rhagoletis  Much of the research on ecological speciation has focused on identifying traits underlying reproductive isolation and examining the resulting patterns of differentiation in the genome  However  drawing concrete connections between ecologically divergent phenotypes and genomic variation has proven difficult  particularly in the case of complex  polygenic traits  Closing the gap between ecological  and  genomic data may be accomplished through a physiologically informed framework to identify the intermediate phenotypes involved in the manifestation of the trait under selection  Here we report results from a study aimed at examining the physiological basis for divergent life history timing in Rhagoletis flies  The two host races in the classic Rhagoletis pomonella system show strong differences in their adult eclosion phenology corresponding to phenological differences of their two host plants  downy hawthorn and domestic apple  This is thought to be be a particularly important component of reproductive isolation in Rhagoletis  association studies and within generation selection experiments have strongly implicated life history timing in the genome wide patterns of divergence observed in this system  We compared the post winter metabolic trajectories of hawthorn and apple pupae to determine whether the allochronic isolation between the races is driven by the regulation of diapause termination or post diapause development rates  We found that apple flies typically terminate diapause within the first few weeks of warm temperatures  while hawthorn flies stay in a state of metabolic suppression long into spring  Our results show that the precise stage of developmental divergence between the two races occurs shortly after the cessation of winter  allowing for finely focused studies comparing the endocrine  transcriptomic  proteomic  and metabolomics profiles of the two races during this critical phase  
Small Genome Attraction Obfuscates Phylogenetic Signal  The increased availability of whole genomic data has spurred phylogenetic reconstruction through gene family presence absence matrices  This method is attractive for its reductive power of enormous datasets that make analyses more tenable  as well as its robustness against homoplasy  given that gene loss and regain is unlikely  However  it has been observed that highly reduced genomes will have an overrepresentation of absences in such matrices  and that species in a given matrix will   attract   each other  leading to spurious phylogenetic inferences  The overdetermination of absences is explored  both through simulation and with respect to empirical datasets in recent publications  A new metric is proposed to test for significance value of small genome attraction and hidden signal in the dataset  
 Allele changes during spore formation on the mycorrhizal fungi  Rhizophagus irregularis   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  AMF  are endo symbionts of plant roots  They provide mineral nutrients to the plant in exchange of photosynthesized carbon  In addition  AMF affects plant growth  plant community assembly and plant tolerance to heavy metals   These fungi have been considered as ancient asexual organism that reproduce clonally by producing multinucleate spores  Recently whole genome sequencing of in vitro cultures of the model species Rhizophagus irregularis has shown little genetic polymorphism among coexisting nuclei in these cultures  However  single spore cultures segregated from parental cultures alter differently rice growth  suggesting significant polymorphism between the single spore cultures   In order to understand if there is a genetic basis of this process  we tested whether single spore cultures present genetic polymorphism  For this we produced single spore cultures of R  irregularis  bottlenecked lines  and we used next generation sequencing to assess the genetic polymorphism  Contrary to the little polymorphism hypothesis  we found that there is big genetic polymorphism among the single spore cultures  Moreover  we show that the genetic polymorphism is present in coding  non coding  repetitive and non repetitive regions  The most part of the polymorphism is due to allele loss or duplication  These results add more arguments to the debate whether this ancient asexual is genetically polymorphic   
 Divergence and reproductive isolation along elevation gradients in the Hawaiian landscape dominant tree  Metrosideros   At least 60 000 tree species are recognized  yet the conditions that drive their origin remain poorly understood   Hawaii s Metrosideros species complex comprises five species and numerous varieties of woody taxa that have arisen within the islands  heterogeneous landscapes since the group s common ancestor arrived on Kaua i roughly 4 mya   Currently  O ahu  2 6   3 0 myo  supports the greatest taxonomic richness of any island with  12 varieties and species of Metrosideros  most of which occur in a predictable sequence from low to high elevation   To examine the strengths of ecological divergence and reproductive isolation among these incipient taxa we contrasted the seedling responses of eight taxa to contrasting light and phosphorus levels in a greenhouse experiment and conducted controlled crosses within and among five taxa in the field   All taxa examined were cross compatible  and pure and F1 hybrid seedlings from the controlled crosses were outplanted in parental environments   Preliminarily  both the greenhouse and reciprocal outplanting experiments reveal significant differences among the regeneration niches of taxa that span elevation gradients  and the crossing study reveals a postzygotic barrier in the form of reduced survivorship of F1s in parental environments as well as possible life history character divergence among taxa   Final results of these year long experiments will be presented and implications for the role of elevation gradients in tree speciation will be discussed  
The evolution of life cycle gene expression in the Volvocine algae  toward a molecular understanding of multicellular evolution  Multicellularity is a major evolutionary transition that has occurred at least twenty five independent times in eukaryotes  However  the molecular genetic basis of this transition in any taxa is not well understood  The Volvocine algae are a model system to study the evolution of multicellularity because they consist of a recently evolved  approximately 200 million years ago  monophyletic group of organisms that morphologically span from unicellular  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  to multicellular with germa and soma differentiation  Volvox carteri    The colonial multicellular alga  Gonium pectorale  is a sister species to C  reinhardtii  and is an exemplary species to study the transition from unicellularity to colonial multicellularity   C  reinhardtii and G  pectorale grow and divide similarly  however when G  pectorale cells under go multiple fission  multiple rounds of mitotic divisions   the daughter cells remain attached to each other  whereas in C  reinhardtii  the daughter cells separate   This  along with other experimental evidence  suggests that the colonial multicellular phenotype of G  pectorale is under cell cycle regulation   In this experiment  we used RNA Seq analysis to investigate changes in gene expression across the 24 hour cell cycle of G  pectorale   We performed two independent RNA Seq experiments  a broad scale experiment where RNA samples were pooled into 4 biologically relevant time points  and a finer scale experiment where RNA samples were pooled every two hours  again across the 24 hour cell cycle   RNA samples underwent Illumina library preparation and HiSeq sequencing   We then used the Tuxedo suite of software for differential gene expression analysis   Genes involved in cell cycle regulation  cell wall organization and fission were significantly differentially expressed    We will confirm our results with functional characterization of strong multicellular candidate genes  
Genetic constraints cause mutation rate catastrophe  As the fundamental sources of evolutionary innovations  mutations play an important role in the evolution of populations  Mutator alleles commonly occur as variants in DNA repair systems in many natural and experimental populations  Individuals with mutator alleles can possess mutation rates over 1000 fold greater than wildtype  The trade off between acquiring beneficial mutations and avoiding accumulation of excessive deleterious mutations becomes an intriguing question for the evolution and maintenance of mutator alleles  Mutation rate catastrophe was found in previous theoretical study  where the mutation rates of populations can surge up to an extraordinarily high level  The populations experience huge mutational load due to the high rate of deleterious mutations  Thus  the population fitness suddenly declines after experiencing exponential fitness growth  Surprisingly  the mutation rates do not arrest but continue to soar during the fitness decline until it drop to an extremely low level when the population essentially go extinct  Here we employ a Wright Fisher model of adaptive evolution of both asexual and sexual populations  Based on it  evolutionary simulations are performed through a selection reproduction mutation life cycle for populations  We found that the inability to efficiently remove mutators from the population can cause the mutation rate catastrophe  Specifically  low mutation rates to antimutators or antimutators with small effects to lower the mutation rates lead to mutation rate catastrophe  Moreover  recombination can facilitate the process of removing mutators from the population and prevent the catastrophe  We conclude that the genetic constraints that impede the process of eliminating mutators from populations can lead to the mutation rate catastrophe  
Disease and freeways drive genetic change in urban bobcat populations  Urbanization profoundly impacts animal populations by causing isolation  increased susceptibility to disease  and exposure to toxicants  Genetic effects include reduced effective population size  increased population substructure  and decreased adaptive potential  We investigated the influence that urbanization and a disease epizootic had on the population genetics of bobcats  Lynx rufus  distributed across a highly fragmented urban landscape  We genotyped more than 300 bobcats  sampled from 1996 2012  for variation at nine neutral and seven immune gene linked microsatellite loci  We found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow  Further  a 3 year disease epizootic  associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure  caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre  and post disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years  However  balancing selection acted on immune linked loci during the epizootic  maintaining variation at functional regions  Conservation assessments need to assay loci that are potentially under selection in order to better preserve the adaptive potential of populations at the urban wildland interface  Further  inter connected regions that contain appropriate habitat for wildlife will be critical to the long term viability of animal populations in urban landscapes    
ddRAD seq analyses of population structure in brood parasitic indigobirds  Vidua spp    The African indigobirds  Vidua spp   are exceptional in that learning and mimicry of host vocalizations leads to adult behaviors that result in assortative mating and host fidelity  These behaviors provide a mechanism for rapid sympatric speciation via host shifts  Host shifts imply a non zero rate of host infidelity  however  and the same behavioral mechanisms may lead to hybridization if eggs are laid in the nest of a host species already associated with another indigobird species  Thus  it is not clear if the morphological and genetic similarity of indigobird species is due to their recent common ancestry or ongoing hybridization  We addressed this question using  double digest  restriction site associated DNA sequencing  ddRAD seq  to collect genomic data for three indigobird species  one of which has two host races  in Cameroon  Samples from all species were collected at two sampling localities  and we conducted population genetic analyses to determine if local gene flow or interspecific divergence best explains patterns of genomic variation  Results indicate that there is considerable divergence among species and species cohesion between sampling localities  Conspecific host races  however  are genetically similar and analyses of rare  derived alleles suggest that they continue to hybridize locally  Whether these incipient populations will eventually diverge into diagnosable species despite ongoing gene flow remains an open question  
Sex determination and the young Asparagus Y chromosome  The evolutionary processes driving the origin of sex chromosomes in association with shifts from hermaphroditism to dioecy is of fundamental interest  Garden asparagus  Asparagus officinalis  is a dioecious vegetable crop species with a recently evolved  homomorphic sex chromosome pair  Sex determination has been genetically mapped to a small   
 Small dog  hairy dog  big dog  scary dog  understanding the genetics of morphological traits in the domestic dog   The domestic dog  Canis lupus familiaris  displays extreme diversity of morphological traits  primarily due to intensive artificial selection during breed formation  This unique history makes the dog an excellent model species for studying morphological phenotypes  Since many of these phenotypes  such as fur length  body size  and ear flop  are fixed within breeds  breed mapping approaches to genome wide association studies  GWAS  have been used to successfully identify underlying quantitative trait loci  QTLs   In contrast to humans  a few QTLs of large effect account for the majority of variation among dog breeds   To further investigate the genetic basis of body size  and several fur phenotypes  we genotyped a diverse panel of 4000 dogs  representing over 150 breeds and 350 village dogs  at more than 180 000 SNP markers  GWAS revealed additional novel loci  including a missense mutation in the gene MC5R that is associated with both the degree of fur shedding and medium versus short length fur   Our genotyped panel also contained individual body size measurements for over 2000 dogs  GWAS of individual and breed average body size measures yielded similar results  with the identification of seventeen key QTLs  accounting for 80 to 85   of variation in weight and height  Using a linear model  we estimate the effect sizes of each QTL on numerous body size measurements within and among breeds  as well as in village dogs  Furthermore  we test for non additive and epistatic effects between loci  providing the most complete understanding to date of the genetic architecture of size variation in this model system  
Resolving relationships in tribe Cecropieae  Urticaceae   Implications for reconstructing ant associations in Cecropia  Ant plant mutualisms are abundant in the tropics and are an ideal model system for studying mutualisms   While many studies have focused on the ecology of ant plant mutualisms  in some systems  evolutionary studies have been hindered by the lack of a solid of taxonomic framework   A common ant plant mutualism in the neotropics involves the genus Cecropia  fast growing pioneer trees important in forest regeneration   Relationships between genera in the tribe Cecropieae  Urticaceae  which includes Cecropia  Coussapoa  Musanga  Myrianthus  and Pourouma  are unknown and  are necessary to investigate the evolutionary history of the Cecropia ant mutualism  A Bayesian analysis of the NADH dehydrogenase  ndhF  gene region of the chloroplast and the 26S region of the ribosomal DNA supports antless African Musanga embedded within the Cecropia clade   Neotropical Pourouma and Coussapoa are highly supported as sister to each other   Myrianthus falls sister to the other genera in the tribe  but will low support   Musanga embedded within Cecropia supports ant association arising in the tropics and the migration of Cecropia out of its native range into Africa and loss of neotropical ant association    
GBS in Cornus florida L reveals co  divergence in genetic structure and foliar fungal communities along environmental gradients        Understanding the molecular basis of ecological adaptation is a fundamental question in evolutionary ecology  Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology permit rapid generation of a large number of molecular markers for population genetic study  facilitating identification of genes or DNA markers associated with ecological adaptation   We employ the Genotyping by Sequencing  GBS  method for a study of Cornus florida L   the flowering dogwood tree   Natural populations of the species are severely threatened by dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew diseases  Thus  evaluating the genetic diversity and how environmental factors have shaped the genetic structure and associated fungal communities in the species is crucial to conservation management   We genotyped 180 plants using the GBS method for six populations occurring in three different ecological habitats and measured environmental conditions along with functional traits from each site  Site measurements include mineral and macronutrient analysis of soils  quantifying N  P  Na  cation exchange  etc    visual measurement of canopy afflicted by disease  leaf blotting  spotting  or branch dieback   and leaf osmotic potential   The objectives are to test whether differences in abiotic environmental conditions have resulted in local ecological adaptation  genetic differentiation  and differences in associated fungal communities and to identify loci associated with the ecological adaptation  Our measurements of environment conditions at sites generally corroborate records of environmental differences  and measurements of disease severity support findings that mountain populations are plagued more by dogwood anthracnose  Preliminary analyses of GBS data  identified on an average approximately 1090 SNPs per individual  Results from analyses of the data suggest genetic grouping of populations corresponding to an environmental gradient   Estimation of Fst per locus found approximately 300 potential outlier loci with high Fst values between populations from different environments  Blast of GBS data to fungal genomic databases identified fungal communities associated with the leaves of each population  The distribution and abundance of fungal taxa in the six populations exhibit correlation with environmental gradients  The data suggest that GBS is a valuable method for population genomics and metagenomic analysis of plant pathogens   The preliminary results further suggest that lower disease severity in coastal populations is likely a consequence of local adaption to different environment conditions favoring different kinds of pathogens and fungi communities  Healthy plants in pathogen prevalent  e g   mountains  and rare  e g   coast  environments may have a genetic basis for resistance  This will be tested with more detailed analysis of the data on genotype phenotype association  
Preliminary Evidence for DNA Methylation as a Mechanism of Adaptive Transgenerational Plasticity in the Annual Plant Polygonum persicaria  Transgenerational plasticity has garnered much research interest in recent years  but several key questions remain   how often do these environmentally induced effects influence fitness  for how many generations do they persist  and how are these effects inherited  Recent studies of the annual plant Polygonum persicaria showed that drought stress induces functionally appropriate changes in offspring root growth that persist for at least two generations and lead to increased survival under severe drought stress of seedlings whose grandparents and parents grew in dry soil  I will present preliminary evidence that inheritance of drought induced DNA methylation changes may be a mechanism for transmitting these adaptive effects  The results of methylation sensitive AFLP  MSAP  analysis of  200 anonymous marker loci suggest that drought causes changes in DNA methylation that are transmitted to offspring grown in a common  moist soil greenhouse environment  I will also present tests for drought induced changes in DNA methylation patterns within a generation  including tests for correlations between specific drought induced DNA methylation epialleles and adaptive  drought induced phenotypes  The use of multiple  highly inbred Polygonum genetic lines in these studies allows for assessments of genetic diversity in the induction and inheritance of phenotypes and DNA methylation patterns  
Speciation and hybridization in Jamaican Streamertail Hummingbirds  Trochilus polytmus and Trochilus scitulus are known to hybridize  but the hybrid zone has stayed shockingly narrow through time  The origin and maintenance of such a narrow hybrid zone linking species with high dispersal capabilities on a small oceanic island defies traditional explanations  The standard toolbox of techniques and genetic markers used to study hybrid zones has failed to reveal fixed differences that are generally needed to reconstruct speciation scenarios  We use genotyping by sequencing to gather a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  dataset for both parental types and putative hybrids  We use these data to examine patterns of genomic differentiation and introgression and look for signatures of selection  We discuss the implications of these results for Trochilus  and also discuss ways these genomic data can be used in conjunction with other datasets for hybrid zone studies  
Incongruence among classes of markers and data types in supermatrices  implications for phylogenomics and Drosophila evolution  Inference of phylogeny is currently based on the concatenation of many genes  usually extracted from genome scaled data  and less commonly amplified by targeted PCR  Here I show that although two supermatrices  of respectively 102 genes from 21 taxa  and 17 genes from 67 taxa  apparently resolve most of the relationships within the subgenus Sophophora  the phylogenetic signal is not homogenously distributed among the three main classes of genes in the super matrices  nuclear protein coding  mitochondrial protein coding  and non protein coding sequences  Each of the three classes robustly support competing topologies at some nodes  particularly close to tips  Most  but not all  of these incongruences are due to signal associated with synonymous substitutions  The three classes  as well as their codon positions are characterised by different nucleotide composition  a putative reasons behind conflicting phylogenetic signal  other reasons being likely incomplete lineage sorting and or more subtle sources of systematic errors  Counterintuitively  neither among genes nor among codon positions partitioning is successful in detecting or alleviating the incongruences  These results advocate that extra care should be taken when interpreting high supports from the analysis of genome scaled supermatrices as different gene types and or data types may harbour different signal particularly at synonymous sites  These phylogenetic incongruences may be however extremely instructive to understand species biology  and to disentangle from possible sources of systematic error  As for the Sophophora  results confirms D  eugracilis as the sister of the melanogaster subgroup  and show that incomplete lineage sorting is likely more widespread among the Drosophila than previously thought  
The evolution and transcriptional connectivity of genes underlying ant division of labor  Division of labor is a defining feature of eusocial organisms that is thought to underlie their ecological and evolutionary success  Hypotheses for the evolutionary genetic basis of social insect division of labor focus mainly on the simple modification of highly conserved gene networks that directly influence an individual s physiology and behavior  We studied the degree to which the transcriptional architecture underlying worker age based division of labor in the pharaoh ant Monomorium pharaonis includes highly conserved genes and tightly connected gene modules  We identified genes and modules of co regulated genes underlying age based division of labor among workers  and then estimated rates of molecular evolution at these genes  Altogether  our results suggest that the evolutionary genetic basis of worker division of labor involves combinations of conserved genes and highly connected gene modules  as well as less well connected modules and more rapidly evolving genes  
Next generation sequencing provides genetic insight to sapsucker speciation  Yellow bellied  Sphyrapicus varius   red breasted  S  ruber  and red naped  S  nuchalis  sapsuckers are three species that make up the varius sapsucker superspecies complex   All three species are phenotypically distinct and are widely distributed throughout North America with minimal overlap to their ranges where hybrid zones occur  Genetic studies to date are limited to allozyme and mitochondrial studies that are unable to conclusively differentiate between the three species  Due to limited genetic evidence  classification of the congeners as individual species is instead a result of phenotypic differentiation  distinct geographic distribution  and evidence of assortative mating within contact zones  Our study uses genotyping by sequencing  GBS  to study speciation in the varius complex and provide evidence of a genetic basis for species identification  Samples have been collected at various sites throughout North America for each of the species  We are examining these samples to initially determine if the three species are genetically distinct  Our second question focusses on the level of introgression in each species and whether it is a result of recent admixture or incomplete lineage sorting  
Capturing regions of extreme diversity in genomes  Next gen sequencing and why your  false positives  might be exactly what you are looking for   Genome structure  in addition to natural selection  can have a strong influence on the patterns and mechanisms of molecular evolution   The reduced sequence complexity of A+T biased genomes  such as that of the malaria parasites Plasmodium yoelii  78  A+T  and P  falciparum  82  A+T   affects rates of point mutation  recombination  and repeat expansions   These mechanistic changes  combined with short generation times and strong selective pressures  can produce and maintain high levels of genetic diversity among individuals and species   These aspects of genome structure and evolution make it challenging to get an accurate picture of genome diversity using Next Generation Sequencing data because existing methods for detecting variation not sensitive to low complexity genome or regions of rapid evolution   Using an evolutionary approach  and four genomes of the rodent malaria parasite P  yoelii  three within the same species group  and one outside   we have uncovered hundreds of focused regions of extreme divergence that would have been discarded as false positives by standard methods   These regions range in size from about 10 residues to over 500  and represent both large insertion deletion events as well as regions without size differences that are highly divergent   Among genomes that normally range between 98 5  to 99 6  identity at the nucleotide level  99  to almost 100  amino acid identity   these rapidly evolving regions average just 50  amino acid identity    Genes of all functional groups contain these focused regions of diversity  including antigens and cell invasion ligands likely under selection from the host  and enzymes and structural proteins that are not normally associated with high levels of diversity    This new method  plus modifications to the standard applications of open source computational tools  allows us to capture a more complete picture of functional and overall sequence diversity in these parasite genomes   We have designed a simple program and pipeline to apply these new methods to identify all variants in low complexity or diverse genomes with a high level of accuracy  
Understanding the evolution and genetic basis of variation in vernalization in Mimulus guttatus  The timing of flowering is one of the most important traits in the plant life cycle  Many plants synchronize their flowering to seasonal changes  so that vegetative and reproductive phases are tailored to local climate and edaphic conditions  One such cue is winter  certain plants do not initiate flowering unless they have experienced prolonged cold  The promotion of flowering by prolonged exposure to cold is known as vernalization  Mimulus guttatus  the yellow monkeyflower  is polymorphic for vernalization requirement  with most perennial populations requiring vernalization  and most annual populations not needing it   Thus  this is an excellent system for understanding both the genetic basis and the adaptive significance of this key flowering time difference  Here  we use growth chamber experiments that combine different photoperiods and temperature treatments to pinpoint the exact nature of responses  Quantitative Trait Loci mapping experiments have demonstrated that only a few major QTL underlie this trait   Focusing on 6 flowering time genes in these regions  we use candidate gene expression analyses in different treatments and at various time points to determine each gene s role in the evolution of flowering time responses  Characterizing the genetic architecture of natural variation in vernalization is a key step towards understanding the process of local adaptation in M  guttatus  and flowering time evolution more generally  
Diversification of Horseshoe Bats  Horseshoe bats  Rhinolophidae  are one of the most speciose families of mammals   100spp   They exhibit highly specialised  species specific constant frequency echolocation calls  which correspond to a narrowly tuned frequency range of the inner ear  Due to this auditory specificity  horseshoe bat calls are thought to play a dual role in prey detection and communication  Such traits that influence both ecology and mate choice could facilitate speciation and  therefore  may underpin the diversification of this group   To test if this unusual system of echolocation has contributed to the radiation of horseshoe bat species  call frequency range 20 kHz   120 kHz   we screened for evidence of positive selection in sensory genes across the group  RNAseq was used to obtain the coding genes of nine horseshoe bat species  From  10 000 single copy orthologs  we identified  80 genes with known roles in hearing  These were then sequenced through a novel targeted capture approach  MyBaits  in a further 13 horseshoe bat species  We were able to identify 22  hearing genes  under selection within the horseshoe bat clade  both on the branch leading to horseshoe bats and within the horseshoe bat phylogeny  This result supports our hypothesis that hearing has played a crucial role in the evolution and diversification of these bats  
Pollen shedding occurs in discrete bursts at or near resonance frequencies in wind pollinated Plantago lanceolata L   Wind pollination has evolved from insect pollination at least 65 times in the flowering plants  It is likely that a key evolved difference between wind  and animal pollinated species is that pollen is more easily detached from stamens of the former  This could be because wind pollinated plants have   1  stamens that are rapidly accelerated when vibrated by wind  and or  2  pollen grains that adhere weakly to the anther  Unfortunately  there has been virtually no empirical work on wind flower interactions and thus the biomechanical pathway from animal to wind pollination is unclear  Using Plantago lanceolata we present evidence that turbulence acts directly on stamens  causing resonance vibrations that release pollen grains  In the laboratory we show that stamens can be modeled as underdamped cantilever beams with elastic properties corresponding to predicted ranges for turbulence induced resonance vibrations  Exciting stamens near their natural frequency caused them to resonate  maximizing the amount of pollen released while minimizing the acceleration of the excitation at the time of release  Pollen release was episodic  with short bursts occurring at ever increasing accelerations for a given anther  The natural frequency increased with each episode due to the reduced mass of the anther  which increased the energy requirements for subsequent episodes or was perhaps due to differences in pollen adhesion forces within and among stamens  Observations under natural conditions in the field support the laboratory results and demonstrate that pollen is released from resonating stamens  It is possible that resonance vibrations of stamens may be a general mechanism facilitating pollen shedding in wind pollinated angiosperms  Moreover  stamen properties such as damping ratio and flexural rigidity may provide useful measures for differentiating anemophilous from zoophilous species  
Estimating phenotypic selection in an age structured moose Alces alces population by removing transient fluctuations  We provide an extension for the selection differential in the Robertson Price equation for the mean phenotype in an age structured population  We demonstrate that temporal changes in the mean pheno  type caused by transient fluctuations in the age distribution and variation in mean phenotype among age classes  which can mistakenly be interpreted as selection  will disappear if reproductive value weighting is applied  We use this to show that the change in any weighted mean phenotype in an age structured population may be decomposed into between  and within age class components  Using reproductive value weighting the between age class component becomes pure noise  generated by previous genetic drift or fluctuating selection  This component  which we call transient quasi selection  can therefore be omitted when estimating age specific selection on fecundity or viability within age classes  This approach provides a general approach to analyse selection on the mean phenotype in fluctuating age structured populations  We apply this approach to estimate selection on birth time and calf body mass in a population of indi  vidually marked moose Alces alces from northern Norway  In this area mean spring temperatures has increased by 1 degree Celcius over the last half a century  and the same trend is present during the study period  though only significant in April  Contrary to our expectations we find that birth dates has increased over the years  and there is no support for negative or positive selection of birth time  On the contrary  we detect negative selection of calf body mass across years which is strongest in the first age class  though there has been no temporal change mean calf body mass  
Evolution of imprinted genes in the Mimulus guttatus species complex  Genomic imprinting is the differential expression of alleles dependent upon parent of origin  In flowering plants  a subset of genes exhibit imprinted expression in the endosperm  the tissue that provides nutrition to the embryo during germination  Such imprinted expression may have evolved via parent offspring conflict  POC   where mothers and offspring  ie  fathers   conflict over the degree and length of maternal investment  POC may be particularly prominent in flowering plants  where mothers often mate promiscuously invest substantially in offspring  and where maternal investment is a dynamic process mediated by a placental connection that allows mothers to alter investment over the course of embryonic development  Moreover  endosperm has a 2 1 maternal paternal genome ratio  unlike the 1 1 ratio of the embryo  introducing another source of conflict between mother and offspring  Dosage imbalances in imprinted gene expression is linked to premature seed death  and it has been suggested that allopatric divergence in protein sequences of regulatory elements and or their targets may be a common cause of hybrid failure in flowering plants  If true  genes that exhibit imprinted expression in endosperm should evolve more rapidly in comparison with genes that do not  We test this prediction using genomic sequence data from several members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex  Specifically  we compare rates of evolution in a species pair whose primary isolating barrier is known to be hybrid seed lethality  serpentine adapted M  guttatus and M  nudatus  In addition  we test whether endosperm imprinted genes are evolving more rapidly in outcrossing taxa  e g   M  nudatus  where POC should be potent  than in selfing taxa  e g   M  nasutus  where POC should be muted  This work will shed light on whether intragenomic conflict  and particularly POC  expressed through genomic imprinting  may contribute to speciation in plants  
The  dry diagonal  of South America as a driver of ecological diversification in turtle ants  The South American  dry diagonal  is a distinct biogeographic region that has been implicated as an important driver of ecological diversification  Also known as the Chacoan region  the dry diagonal is comprised of the Cerrado  Caatinga and Chaco biomes that together create a continuous expanse of open and seasonally dry vegetation extending from northeastern Brazil to northern Argentina  The Chacoan region is known to have high levels of biodiversity and endemism  yet it has rarely been the focus of work addressing diversification dynamics in the Neotropics  especially compared to work that focuses on the adjacent Amazon region  Nevertheless  recent work on the turtle ants  Cephalotes   a species rich genus of arboreal ants  has suggested that ecological opportunity in the Chacoan region has been important in driving the diversification dynamics of the lineage  More specifically  rates of diversification in the turtle ants have been shown to slow overall  while one subclade associated with the Chacoan region exhibits a recent  rapid burst of diversification  Moreover  species found in the region have been shown to be phylogenetically clustered and to have a higher rate of speciation than outside the region  Here  we use recently developed methods to further explore how ecological opportunity  represented by the relatively young vegetation of the Chacoan region  has shaped diversification dynamics in the turtle ant lineage  Our analyses include the use of a total evidence divergence time estimation analysis and methods for detecting patterns of diversity dependence that take missing species into account  We particularly focus on comparing the overall diversification dynamics of the lineage with those of the Chacoan subclade previously identified  and a second candidate subclade of Chacoan diversification  Our analyses reveal a signature of overall diversification consistent with diversity dependence  an early burst and then a decline in rates of diversification towards the present   but with an important role of the Chacoan biogeographic region in influencing recent radiations in a turtle ant subclades  Overall  our analyses highlight the important role of the understudied Chacoan region in Neotropical diversification  and how the region may represent a significant  recent ecological opportunity for some Neotropical lineages  
Comparative population genomics of island endemic reedfrogs  dispersal and diversification in the Gulf of Guinea  The ecological theory of island biogeography describes species richness on islands as an equilibrium between colonization and extinction  yet many lineages undergo extensive diversification within islands and these in situ speciation events contribute significantly to total island biodiversity  Classic investigations of island biogeography have focused on relatively young and remote archipelagos with focal species that are either good dispersers across saltwater barriers or that have radiated extensively within a particular archipelago  Here we examine these same mechanisms within the Gulf of Guinea islands  a relatively old archipelago located a few hundred kilometers from West Central Africa that hosts numerous endemic species from groups that are considered poor dispersers across saltwater barriers  Among the islands   poor dispersing  vertebrates  reedfrogs  genus Hyperolius  are thought to be the only lineage that diversified within a single island and also dispersed between islands in the archipelago  Therefore  this group presents an opportunity to jointly investigate colonization routes from the mainland  dispersal within the island chain  and in situ diversification  The prevailing hypothesis for the presence of amphibians on the Gulf of Guinea islands is assisted dispersal via vegetation rafts that are swept down major river drainages into the gulf following large rain events  We employ a multi locus phylogeography approach with range wide sampling of the most closely related mainland taxon of the island endemics  H  cinnamomeoventris  to confirm that Hyperolius in the Gulf of Guinea result from a single colonization event originating from either the OgoouŽ or Congo River basins in West Central Africa  Using a species tree approach with genome wide SNPs  RADseq  we recover three distinct lineages in the archipelago  one on Pr’ncipe island and two on S‹o TomŽ  that correspond to two currently recognized species  H  molleri  which is found on both islands and H  thomensis  which is only present on S‹o TomŽ   Estimates of historical population demography confirm that Hyperolius first colonized S‹o TomŽ  that H  molleri subsequently dispersed to Pr’ncipe  and that migration between populations of H  molleri on the two islands is not ongoing  Hyperolius thomensis and H  molleri are considered distinct species based on a number of phenotypic and life history differences  yet where the two species  ranges overlap on S‹o TomŽ we identify a secondary contact zone with unidirectional hybridization from H  thomensis to H  molleri  Combined  these results reveal a complex history of dispersal  in situ divergence  and gene flow in generating biodiversity in the Gulf of Guinea  
Dated Phylogeny of Asian coralsnakes reveals an endemic genus from the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot  The Asian coralsnakes  Calliophis and Sinomicrurus  are an enigmatic assemblage of poorly known venomous snakes  A clear understanding of their radiation  including evolutionary relationships  temporal patterns of species diversification and biogeographic history has remained elusive  Using both mitochondrial and nuclear gene fragments and fossil data we estimate the most comprehensive phylogenetic relationships to date among Asian coralsnakes and evaluate their position among the Elapidae  The phylogenetic signal in our data set is evaluated using concatenated methods  parsimony  bayesian and maximum likelihood  and species tree analyses  we use multiple calibration points to assess Bayesian divergence times in major Elapid lineages  Our results reveal the presence of an ancient  cryptic taxon endemic to the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot that diverged from all other Indian Calliophis during the late Oligocene or early Miocene  Our analysis also reveals that the Calliophis from South East Asia are deeply divergent from the Indian species and pursued their unique evolutionary trajectory after splitting  We thus propose that the distinctive Indian taxon should be recognized as a new and monotypic genus and suggest the resurrection of the Genus Maticora for the Southeast Asian species  
Parallel evolution as a tool for understanding what limits the rate of adaptation   Ecological communities undergoing parallel evolution to a common selection pressure are naturally occurring  chemostats  that allow us to study the dynamics and genetic underpinnings of repeated rounds of adaptation to a common environment  Notably  these systems allow us to understand the number of permissible paths that lead to the same adaptation  To this end  we surveyed the transcriptomes of numerous specialist insects that have independently evolved the ability to feed on plants that produce toxic secondary compounds  cardenolides  that they often sequester for use in their defense  A specific target of these toxins is Na +  K +  ATPase  a large ubiquitously expressed protein involved in a number of vital functions  Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity  amino acid substitutions associated with host plant specialization are highly clustered  with many parallel substitutions  Additionally  we document four independent duplications of the gene with convergent tissue specific expression patterns  We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions  Together  these findings strongly implicate negative pleiotropy as a major factor limiting the rate of adaptation of cardenolide tolerance   More generally  our approach illustrates how evolutionary parallelism can be probed in a diverse set of non model organisms and ecological contexts to learn about the dynamics of adaptation  
Repeated evolution of serpentine tolerance across Monkeyflower species  Mimulus   For plants  harsh soil conditions such as serpentine soils present a particularly challenging living environment  as soils provide the primary source of nutrients for a plant  Serpentine soils have greatly reduced essential nutrients such as calcium  and contain near toxic levels of magnesium and heavy metals  Despite such inhospitable conditions  many species have adapted to survive on serpentine soils   Limited experimental research suggests that tolerance has been achieved in many ways  Within the Mimulus genus alone  there have been at least 14 independent origins of serpentine tolerance  Recent research in the Willis lab has identified genetic loci in Mimulus guttatus that are required for survival on serpentine soil and in low Ca Mg environments  In order to understand whether similar physiological and genetic mechanisms are used in the repeated evolution of serpentine tolerance  we must examine more serpentine tolerant species within Mimulus  Multiple species that occur on serpentine soil were studied to determine their mechanisms of tolerance and compared to M  guttatus  Tolerant and non tolerant populations of each species were grown on native serpentine soils in the lab and scored for signs of stress and intolerance  Non tolerant individuals showed severe necrosis  an effect of insufficient calcium  while tolerant individuals appeared healthy and succeeded to flowering  Based on physiological data  the mechanism of tolerance for some species appears to be the same as with M  guttatus  but QTL mapping is required to confirm whether the same genetic loci are responsible for serpentine tolerance  This expansive study will allow us to better understand mechanisms of serpentine tolerance  and also provide insight into the extent that parallel or convergent adaptation occurs between closely related species   
Modeling underwater light and visual sensitivity in the estuarine diamondback terrapin  Malaclemys terrapin   We measured the absorbance spectra of oil droplets and visual pigments in retinal photoreceptors  as well as the ocular media  i e  lens  cornea  in the diamondback terrapin  Malaclemys terrapin  to model physiological visual ability against measured ambient irradiance spectra  Terrapins have a tetrachromatic visual system that matches well with the visual system measured in the closely related freshwater turtle  the red eared slider  Trachemys scripta elegans   The four single cone photoreceptors responsible for this visual system have visual pigment sensitivities with  max   370 nm  UV   457 nm  blue   527 nm  green   and 610 nm  red   as measure by microspectrophotometry  The oil droplets associated with each of the visual pigments act as long pass spectral filters of light that alter the sensitivity of each visual pigment  The ocular media measured in other visual ecology studies is usually found to transmit light equally between 400 and 700 nm  However  the ocular media measured in the terrapin maximally absorbs at 505 nm  causing the ocular media to act as both a short pass and long pass filter of light before it reaches photoreceptors in the retinal epithelium  This results in a dramatic shift in spectral sensitivity with  max   356 nm  UV   427 nm  blue   572 nm  green   and 630 nm  red   The measured ambient irradiance spectrum at the surface of the water column demonstrates relatively low photonic irradiance and relatively low photon capture probability around 500 nm  which suggests that the filtering effects of the ocular media are forcing maximal sensitivities in the terrapin to match maximal light availability  Given that the closely related red eared slider turtle does not have the same ocular media absorbance as measured in the terrapin in this study  we suggest that the terrapin visual system has adapted to the unique light environment that occurs in dynamic estuarine ecosystems  
The role of chemical communication in speciation among Timema stick insects  Biological diversity is created by the formation of new species  but debates persist about how speciation unfolds from beginning to end  i e   the mechanisms of speciation  and the traits that are involved  One important way in which reproductive isolation may evolve is via reduced heterotypic mating due to divergence of mate preferences  i e  sexual isolation   and recent studies have demonstrated highly variable levels of sexual isolation between and within species of Timema  small  wingless  and plant feeding walking stick insects   However  the actual traits and or sensory modalities involved in establishing sexual isolation in Timema have yet to be characterized  Here  I will describe our first results from an interdisciplinary study that integrates behavioral  chemical  experimental  and genomic methods to investigate the role of cuticular hydrocarbons  CHCs  a mixture of lipids on the insect cuticle that have been implicated in chemical communication and speciation in other species of insects  in reproductive isolation in this system  Using chemical ecology techniques we quantified the extent of CHC variation in 24 populations of Timema cristinae occurring on four different host plants  Variation in CHCs can be explained by differences between the life stages  sexes  host plants  and by climatic differences between populations  The degree of CHC divergence among populations also explains the strength of reproductive isolation observed among populations  We then used manipulative mate choice experiments to investigate the causative role of CHCs in sexual isolation  Finally  we used a genome wide association mapping approach  GWAS  to investigate the underlying genetic basis of CHC variation in this species  Our results provide important insights into the communication systems and traits involved in species formation as well as the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation  
Y fuse   Theory and data on sex chromosome fusions  Sex chromosomes are the most rapidly evolving part of the genome in many animals and plants   Fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes are common   Sex antagonistic selection is a leading hypothesis to explain that observation  but there are other ideas that invoke the unique combinations of selection  mutation  and drift that sex chromosomes experience  We present a metaanalysis of vertebrate karyotypes  focussing on the relative frequencies of fusions involving X  Y  Z  and W chromosomes   We then show how the patterns that emerge can be explained by quantitative models of the competing hypotheses  
Inquiry based learning in the Evolution classroom  Teaching a subject perceived as not useful or as uninteresting is a perennial problem for the educator    Over the last three semesters  I have used my upper level majors Evolution course as a testing ground for novel approaches to engaging a population of primarily pre health students in a subject that they do not perceive as relevant   In this talk I will present different techniques that have increased student satisfaction and conceptual learning  as assessed by their ability to explain difficult concepts and to apply facts and ideas in novel situations   In general  I used a variety of in class and out of class group and individual activities that both required to the student to use in class and textbook information or techniques in novel situations and introduced new material   These included critical reading of a journal article  replying to critics of evolution  testing mating strategies  and performing basic phylogenetic techniques   The capstone project used the Quaardvark portal to first asses correlation of two traits in Aves species and then to use real data to map the evolution of both of these traits on a phylogenetic tree   Quaardvark is a database that provides flexible structured natural history data for a variety of animals   It is run through The Animal Diversity Web  which also provides undergraduate level activities designed to help students explore relationships between animal traits    
Patterns of metabolic network evolution in plants  Flowering plants dominate earth s terrestrial environment  How plants evolved to achieve this dominance is a major question in plant biology  Historically  investigations into plant evolution have usually focused on morphological characters  even though metabolism is critical for producing adaptive traits such as pollination  stress tolerance  and defense  Consequently  little is known about the organization  function  regulation  and evolution of plant metabolic networks  To better understand plant metabolism in light of evolution and enable systematic comparisons of metabolism across plant species  we developed a high throughput computational infrastructure that combines machine learning based prediction  automated validation  and manual curation of enzymes and pathways  Using this infrastructure  we predicted the metabolic complements of 14 flowering plants  7 grasses  7 eudicots   1 moss  1 early vascular plant  and 1 algal species  We compared the conservation and divergence of metabolic pathways across these species in terms of metabolic domain  pathway topology  gene duplication history  and genomic organization of metabolic genes  We discovered a number of interesting and surprising findings  including greater proliferation of genes coding for specialized metabolic functions by mechanisms distinct from primary metabolic genes  extensive lineage specific patterns of physical clustering within the genome and coexpression  equivalent gain and loss events of reactions leading to pathway divergence  and differential points of divergence in biosynthesis and degradation pathways  
The role of induced mutations as steps toward a Fisherian optimum in Arabidopsis thaliana under field conditions  Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation  allowing natural selection to act  Recent efforts in the study of adaptation genetics have focused on ways to predict how new mutations will contribute to the process of adaptation  most notably relying on mathematical extensions of Fisher s Geometric Model  FGM  and tests of these mathematical findings through experiments with microorganisms  The results have been very encouraging  One prediction of the FGM that has received less attention suggests that less fit lineages are more likely to benefit from new mutations than organisms that have higher fitness in a particular environment  There is some disagreement in the literature  some authors report mathematical models that predict no change in mean fitness due to new mutations regardless of starting fitness and others showing experimental evidence that mutations are more harmful in lineages under stressful conditions  To our knowledge  there has been no experimental study explicitly addressing this aspect of the FGM  We test this using 18 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana from across the species distribution   All accessions were mutated using the chemical mutagen EMS and planted in one field plot along with their pre mutated founder accessions  Fitness was estimated as fruit set x survivorship  Preliminary analyses support Fisher s prediction that less fit lineages will benefit more from new mutations than more fit lineages  
 Genetic diversity of two crustaceans with presumed different reproductive modes in ponds of the Chihuahuan Desert  North America   Inbreeding modes of reproduction are known to decrease a species genetic diversity  making it vulnerable to changing environmental conditions   However  there are various forms of reproduction that can alleviate potentially strong effects of pure clonal reproduction  such as self fertilization  hermaphroditism   hermaphrodites that can outcross with other hermaphrodites  and a rare mix of hermaphrodites that can outcross with males called androdioecy   The tadpole shrimp  Notostraca  Triops   a temporary pond crustacean occurring in the arid regions of western North America  is presumed to use four different modes of reproduction   The method of reproduction used by a Triops species has been determined by prior researchers based on the proportion of males  no ovisacs  to ovisac bearing females  all female populations are presumed to reproduce parthenogenetically or hermaphroditically  populations with some males are presumed to be androdioecious and populations that are approximately equal in sex ratio are presumed to be obligate outcrossing with separate sexes  gonochoric    The current study uses mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite markers on two species of Triops from southern New Mexico with presumed different modes of reproduction  T  newberryi  androdioecious  and T  longicaudatus  short   parthenogenetic or hermaphroditic    The genetic markers reveal a high degree of genetic structure between geographically proximal populations that is likely to represent a persistent founder effect and populations of both species have low genetic diversity   Population genetic theory predicts that an androdioecious species  T  newberryi  would have slightly elevated levels of genetic diversity due to the effects of outcrossing   In comparison to T  l   short   T  newberryi did have higher nucleotide diversity  allelic richness  observed and expected heterozygosity  but the comparisons between species were not statistically significant   However  the level of inbreeding  FIS  and the selfing rate was higher in T  newberryi   Our results imply that either the degree of outcrossing between males and hermaphrodites does not alleviate accumulation of inbreeding or that T  newberryi is not androdioecious as assumed by previous authors   Additional work is in progress to analyze the mating system of these two species using a more direct approach of a progeny array  Genotypes of mothers and individual encysted embryos contained within their ovisacs will be used to better estimate outcrossing rates and to distinguish parthenogenesis from hermaphroditism  
Susceptibility of Caenorhabditis elegans to a bacterial pathogen is a typical quantitative trait with an atypical mutational bias  Understanding the genetic basis of disease susceptibility is an important goal of medical genetics and of evolutionary biology   A key first step toward understanding the genetics and evolution of any phenotypic trait is characterizing the role of mutation  However  the extent to which mutation introduces genetic variation for disease susceptibility has  as far as we know  never been quantified in any organism   Here we quantify the mutational variance  VM  for susceptibility to one strain of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans   VM is a composite parameter dependent on the mutation rate  the size of the mutational target  and the magnitude of allelic effects on the trait   We find that VM for susceptibility to P  aeruginosa is on the order of  or slightly less than VM for a wide variety of life history and morphological traits in this strain of C  elegans  but is well within the range of reported values for those kinds of traits   Perhaps surprisingly  the average susceptibility did not change significantly over 250 generations of mutation accumulation   Consistent with that finding  selection gradient analysis reveals that selection has both a directional and a stabilizing component  which implies that mutant alleles that increase susceptibility to P  aeruginosa come with a fitness cost   The standing genetic variation  VG  for susceptibility to P  aeruginosa in a worldwide collection of wild isolates of C  elegans is very similar to typical values of VG for life history and morphological traits in a variety of taxa  and comparison of VM to VG suggests an average strength of selection against mutations affecting susceptibility to P  aeruginosa of a few tenths of a percent   We conclude that  in this system  pathogen susceptibility presents a fairly large mutational target under relatively weak asymmetric stabilizing selection   These results should inform more realistic models of the evolutionary genetics of pathogen susceptibility  
 Adaptive floral traits  selection through male  female  and total fitness   The milkweed sub family Asclepiadoideae has unique floral structures that  although conserved across species  show a huge amount of diversity in shape and size  Even within the single genus Asclepias  the flowers can vary wildly  It is presumed that these floral traits are adaptive  but that has not been studied outside of Asclepias syriaca    In the past  milkweeds have been a convenient group for studies of male fitness in plants due to the ease of quantifying removed pollen  an estimate of male fitness  With the advancement of molecular tools and genome sequencing  we now have a handful of molecular markers that can be used to conduct paternity analyses  Through paternity analysis  we quantified the number of seeds each plant sired  and calculated selection using this more accurate measure of male fitness  We compare and contrast natural selection on six floral traits in Asclepias exaltata and A  incarnata  using our three measures of fitness  male  female  and total  to better understand how the unusual floral traits of milkweeds are adaptive  
Battle of the sexes   Investigating the evolution of multiple mating types in Dictyostelium  Theory indicates that the number of mating types expressed in a system should tend towards infinity or remain at two   This means it is a puzzle that dictyostelids often have only 3 or 4 mating types  a question that has yet to be addressed in these species   In the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum  there are three self incompatible mating types  which cannot mate with themselves but can mate with any other type   Although sex is rarely observed in this species  we know from previous studies that sex is an important part of the life cycle based on evidence of little or no linkage disequilibrium   Because so little else is known about the characteristics of the D  discoideum mating types  we predict that many factors could contribute to the maintenance of this system   To start  we investigated common measurements for evidence of conflict between mating types and selection on mating systems  gamete size and mating type distribution   While gamete size measurements revealed no evidence of differing selective pressures within D  discoideum  showing that gametes across mating types are homologous in size  mating type distributions show potentially interesting dynamics   Though we found an overall even distribution  we also found population specific mating type distributions  suggesting a possibility for location driven differential selective pressures on these mating types   In addition to these traditional measures  we will also discuss current efforts to identify conflicts between mating types caused by differential contributions to macrocyst production and insight into how these conflicts could lead to constraints on the evolution of many mating types in D  discoideum  
Local adaptation of Metrosideros polymorpha along a steep elevation gradient  Elevation gradients are important drivers of divergence in plants  yet little is known about which abiotic factors along these gradients are responsible for divergence   The endemic Hawaiian tree    hi a lehua  Metrosideros polymorpha   which dominates the forest canopies of Hawai i Island  has diverged along elevation gradients in the forms of two pubescent varieties  M  polymorpha var  incana occurs in monotypic stands on young substrates at lower elevations  M  polymorpha var  polymorpha is monotypic at higher elevations  and purported hybrids are found in between   Previous studies revealed differentiation between early successional var  incana and its late successional counterpart  glabrous var  glaberrima  in light requirements at the seedling stage  at low to middle elevations    To better understand the abiotic factors that drive divergence in tree populations along elevation gradients  we are conducting field  greenhouse  and growth chamber experiments on open pollinated seedlings from six populations  20 families per population  of pubescent M  polymorpha spanning the full elevation range of this species  from near sea level to 2 470 m above sea level  on Hawai i Island   The field experiment involves reciprocal transplants of seedlings from each sampled population into plots at each of the six elevations with mortality recorded monthly   Preliminary results indicate increased mortality of low and mid elevation seedlings compared to high elevation seedlings at the highest elevation site   Next  the greenhouse experiment exposes seedlings from the six elevations to three UV light levels to understand how UV light intensity affects survivorship at the seedling stage   Early results reveal significantly greater mortality under high UV light of seedlings from the two highest elevation populations  in contrast with expectations   Lastly  stress response tests are being done under extreme environmental conditions in a growth chamber  i e   high UV radiation  low temperature  high temperature  and drought    Oxidative damage is visualized by leaf staining with nitro blue tetradium for detecting O2   and 3 3  diaminobenzidine for H2O2   We will discuss the results of these experiments in the context of divergence of long lived tree populations along elevation gradients  
Caribbean biogeography  multiple arachnid lineages reveal the role of dispersal and geology in forming a biodiversity hotspot  The importance of islands in revealing evolutionary processes was already highlighted by Darwin s work on the Galapagos and Wallace s work in the Malay Archipelago  Island biogeography has provided many elegant examples of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in generating biodiversity  These include geological processes such as plate tectonics and volcanism  and traits of organisms such as their size  generation time  and dispersal ability  Dispersal was an early focus of biogeography and is enjoying a renaissance as a key biogeographical player after a brief period of post plate tectonic reticence  Nevertheless  the focus on dispersal has long revolved around its role as an alternative to vicariance in explaining distributions  Here we focus on the role of dispersal abilities in the formation of biodiversity in the Caribbean hotspot  The West Indies form a remarkable archipelago for biogeographical studies  They consist of a dizzying number of islands  most of which are sufficiently old and isolated to have generated endemic forms  yet the islands are situated close enough to three continental landmasses to allow a more active biotic interchange between continents and islands than possible on more isolated archipelagos  It is thus an ideal  laboratory of biogeography and evolution  serving to evaluate how dispersal abilities impact colonization and diversification on archipelagos  By investigating multiple arachnid lineages spanning a large spectrum of dispersal propensities  two scorpion genera  two pseudoscorpion genera  the amblypygid Phrynus  and numerous spider lineages   and their genetic and species diversity over the archipelago  we find that dispersal ability is of fundamental importance in shaping both distribution and diversity of taxa  The degree to which phylogenetic patterns reflect geological history is inversely related to dispersal ability of taxa  with patterns ranging from predictable in poorer dispersers to highly stochastic in excellent dispersers  Diversification peaks at relatively intermediate dispersal abilities with stretches of ocean permitting rare colonization but acting as effective barriers to gene flow   By looking across multiple lineages that differ in key traits such as dispersal  we are beginning to capture some fundamental components of Caribbean biogeography and the key role of dispersal ability in shaping taxon history and diversity   
Evolution of sexual dimorphism within puppet beetles The puppet beetles  Coleoptera  Aderidae  represent one of the taxonomically and systematically poorest known beetle families  There has never been a phylogenetic tree published for the group  These beetles exhibit secondary sexual dimorphism in the form of elaborate male antennae or the presence of large setal patches on the hind legs   The first molecular phylogeny for the Aderidae is presented based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data  Sexually dimorphic morphological characters are mapped onto this phylogeny and ancestral state character reconstructions are performed to examine their evolutionary history 
The Contribution of Migration and Mutation to the Population Shift Following Widespread Rotavirus Vaccination in the United States  The underlying evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that generate and maintain observed patterns of diversity in viral populations are often poorly understood  Dominant concepts of these mechanisms have been derived from a handful of iconic examples  such as HIV and influenza A  where the dynamics are driven by newly arising mutations  We investigate the evolution of rotavirus  a globally ubiquitous and genetically diverse cause of gastroenteritis and leading cause of childhood mortality  which has a distinctive pattern of geographically asynchronous serotype replacement  We take advantage of the introduction of two rotavirus vaccines in the United States in 2006  which created an intense but well defined perturbation  Publicly available sequences of the dominant antigenic protein  VP7  were used to show that in the United States the average genetic distance to the vaccine has increased following routine vaccination  Bayesian phylogenetic analysis combined with stochastic state reconstruction was used to estimate both sequence evolution and migration among geographic regions  We measure the contribution of three alternative population dynamics processes in the shift away from the vaccine  namely mutation  migration  and differential selection of local variants  We identify migration as the dominant process and show that the genetic shift occurred in serotypes independent of their inclusion in the vaccines  These results suggest that the asynchronous local dynamics maintain a diverse global metapopulation that in turn provides migrants that can rapidly respond to local changes in patterns of host immunity  We also find that genetic variation at higher resolution than that typically considered at the coarser  serotype  level may be of relevance to vaccine escape   
Transient Overdominance Can Constrain Evolvability During Rapid Evolution  Many recent studies have shown how initial adaptive substitutions constrain subsequent evolution through epistasis  but most work has focused on haploid systems  Here we show that overdominant alleles arising in a diploid model can reduce the rate of adaptation  We show how the strength and duration of this constraint depend strongly on the underlying genetic architecture of the trait  as well as the shape of the relationship between the trait and fitness  These results demonstrate how evolvability in diploids may be shaped by factors that cannot be predicted from haploid models   
Correlated selection by pollinators generates strong premating isolation across a hybrid zone  A primary goal of speciation research is to understand how ecological differences generate reproductive isolation despite gene flow  One obstacle is that most species pairs have evolved strong intrinsic reproductive barriers that can obscure the traits that were important in promoting early divergence and isolation  Moreover  it is often difficult to establish the evolutionary genetic mechanisms responsible for maintaining particular combinations of traits that together are necessary for effective reproductive isolation  It has been suggested that studying speciation at an earlier stage of divergence  when isolation is not yet complete  may overcome these limitations     Differentiated ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus in southern California provide an excellent opportunity to address these questions  Although they are distinguished primarily based on flower color red in the west and yellow in the east several additional floral and ecophysiological traits vary between them  Consistent with these differences  ecogeographic and pollinator isolation are strong  and intrinsic barriers are weak  Nevertheless  reproductive isolation is incomplete  and the ecotypes hybridize in nature  allowing for gene flow  Taking advantage of this natural  ecological hybrid zone  we used clinal analysis and classical genetic approaches to  1  identify the traits involved in generating reproductive isolation in this system  and  2  to demonstrate that correlational selection is responsible for maintaining particular floral trait combinations that contribute to pollinator isolation   Despite many ecophysiological traits displaying clinal variation  floral traits consistently showed narrower clines  indicating they experienced stronger divergent selection and contribute more to isolation  Moreover  even though many of these floral traits are controlled by independent genetic factors  correlations between them persist in the hybrid zone in the face of gene flow  Taken together  these results not only suggest that pollinators are selecting for divergent floral trait combinations that results in pre mating isolation  but they also demonstrate the power of natural hybrid zones for the study of speciation  
 Life history  Selection and Effective Population Size shaping Evolution during Colonization   Lessons from Drosophila melanogaster    Consider the scenario where a population migrates to a new environment  it encounters qualitatively novel nutrition  possibly including periods in which it starves  and its effective population size is reduced in the course of migration or as a result of an initial lack of adaptation  How will the population s life history evolve and how will effective population size affect its evolutionary response to this new environment  If this population survives and its descendants migrate back to their ancestral environment  how will this preceding period of adaptation to a new environment affect its initial life history  upon return to ancestral conditions  To tackle these issues we used a highly replicated system of Drosophila melanogaster populations of known differentiated histories on which selection  both forward and reverse  was imposed with contrasting population sizes  
Origin and biogeographic relationships of the Southern Appalachian Flora  The rich flora of the Southern Appalachian provides a natural experiment for understanding how one of the major refuges of temperate biota has evolved over the last 60 million years  We investigated the biogeographic origins and patterns of whole flora assembly for 252 woody species representing 157 North American seed plant clades  We tested the hypothesis that intercontinental disjunctions occurred during two main periods of geologic history  A literature survey was used to build a phylogenetically informed database to identify patterns of biogeography and diversification  We generated a list of area connections for all clades  and derived graphic representations of the dynamic of changing area connections and contributions at increasing phylogenetic depth  Species diversity within clades was estimated and plotted relative the number of clades that contain disjunctions to Eurasia  and divergence time data were plotted for key nodes between North American and Eurasian sister clades  and between areas within North America  Southern Appalachian species share equal numbers of sister area connections between Eastern North America and Eastern Asia  Quantification of the overall pattern of diversity across North American clades showed that less than 25  of these clades contribute significantly to adjacent regional floras  At increasing phylogenetic depth  sister clades relationships with Eurasia dominate the biogeographic pattern  with connections to the component area of Europe increasing in contribution  Divergence time data for 60 clades showed that Eastern North America and Eurasian disjunctions occurred continuously throughout the Cenozoic  
The origin of species by means of Dobzhansky Muller incompatibilities  A central challenge in evolutionary biology is understanding the mechanisms by which reproductive barriers between populations evolve and are maintained  The Dobzhansky Muller  DM  model posits that reproductive isolation is caused by incompatibilities between alleles at different loci  However  if the alleles involved in the DM incompatibility are neutral  the resulting reproductive isolation cannot be maintained in the presence of either mutation or gene flow  Here I ask two related questions  Can neutral DM incompatibilities involving more than two loci lead to the evolution of stable reproductive barriers between populations  And  if so  can those reproductive barriers be maintained in the presence of gene flow  I address these questions using an extension of the DM model to multiple loci  I show that  when it comes to multiple DM incompatibilities  the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts  Certain combinations of multiple DM incompatibilities can lead to the evolution of strong reproductive barriers between populations  provided the recombination rate is high relative to the mutation rate  Complex DM incompatibilities  i e   those involving alleles at three or more loci simultaneously  are especially likely to promote the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations  Furthermore  some of the reproductive barriers generated by DM incompatibilities can persist in the presence of substantial gene flow  I consider the possibility that combinations of multiple DM incompatibilities play an important role during the early stages of speciation  
Contemporary co evolution of sea urchin sperm and egg recognition proteins in response to changing population densities  Sperm and eggs that are broadcast into the sea face an uncertain fate because they might come into contact with too few or too many sperm  as either competitors or mates  or because the gametes they encounter are partially or fully incompatible  The selective forces generated by patterns of sperm availability might drive the rapid evolution of gamete recognition proteins    Here I examine how sperm and egg recognition proteins in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus have co evolved over several hundred years associated with the extirpation of predatory sea otters from the Pacific Northwest and the resulting explosion of sea urchin abundances  and thus sperm availability  along this coast    Over this time span  allele frequencies in the sperm bindin protein has shifted from one common allele that performs best at low densities to the emergence of a second common allele that is resistant to polyspermy at high densities   This pattern is mirrored by changes in allele frequencies in the egg receptor for sperm bindin and also results in the contemporary development of linkage disequilibrium between these sperm and egg proteins driven by assortative mating   These results suggest that gamete recognition can evolve rapidly with shifts in abundance allowing individuals to successfully reproduce under changing demographic conditions  
 Mechanistic overlap between plastic and evolved responses to heat stress  revealed through RNA seq   There is currently substantial debate over the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation to new environments   The genetic assimilation hypothesis holds that environmentally induced phenotypes are often the first step in adaptation to environmental change  and later become genetically  assimilated   such that the original environmental stimulus is no longer required to produce the phenotype  An important test of this hypothesis lies in the identification of genes involved in both the plastic and evolved responses to an environmental stress   If genetic adaptation occurs through the assimilation of plastic phenotypes  then the assimilation hypothesis predicts that the genes that are up  or down regulated during the plastic stress response will become permanently up  or down regulated in populations that have evolved increased stress tolerance   We combined artificial selection and heat shock experiments with next generation sequencing to identify the genetic basis of adaptation to heat stress  and to elucidate the genetic linkage between phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation in the crustacean Tigriopus californicus   Our results show important functional linkages between the adaptive and plastic response to heat stress  and have implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of adaptation to new and changing environments  
X linked regulation in the Drosophila male germline  Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have evolved independently numerous times across taxa  often accompanied by the evolution of sex chromosome specific regulation  Transgenic reporters driven by testis specific promoters reveal an X autosome difference in regulation  X linked transgenes show significantly reduced expression compared to autosomal transgenes  We extend this analysis to endogenous genes to ask how testis specific and non specific gene expression changes for genes located on the X and autosomes  We compare endogenous X autosome testis expression using small  2 5 Mb  X autosome transpositions  and translocations  Testis and non specific genes from transpositions show a significant increase in expression when moved to an autosome  but testis specific genes show a significantly greater increase in expression compared to non specific genes  We find that X linked testis specific expression increases over time  suggesting X linked testis specific promoters evolve in response to the severe suppressive environment of the X  We computationally identify and transgenically test a candidate regulatory motif that is overrepresented in the 5  regulatory region of X linked testis specific genes  associated with increased X linked testis specific expression  and conserved across species  These findings are significant for understanding the evolution of sex chromosomes  gene expression in the male germline and X autosome gene movement patterns   
Signatures of Selection on RNA Structures in Influenza Genomes  Influenza viruses are negative sense RNA viruses that cause significant human morbidity and mortality each year   Rapid evolution of antigenic surface proteins allows the virus to re infect hosts who have recovered from prior strains  It is thus important to understand the selective pressures that constrain the evolutionary trajectories of the influenza viral genomes  Most previous research has been focused on identifying amino acid residues that experience positive or negative selection  whereas selection on RNA structures in the anti sense viral genome has received little attention  To address this  we developed an algorithm that scans along the viral genome to identify regions with excessive signals of purifying or positive selection on RNA structure  by comparing the average pairwise structural distances between actual viral RNA sequences with a null distribution  Unlike other algorithms that identify structural constraints  our approach accounts for the phylogenetic relationships between viral sequences  as well constraints on the amino acid sequence  Moreover  our algorithm can detect recent selective pressures  which are of considerable practical interest  Our results on regions of negative selection on RNA structure largely agree with prior studies  and we provide the first evidence of recent positive selection on influenza virus RNA structures  
Does sociality modulate co phylogeny between social shrimps and their host sponges   Intimate biological associations comprise a large part of biodiversity and clarifying the nature and the evolution of these associations has been a fundamental quest in ecology and evolution  Here we study the evolutionary relationships between  20 species of Caribbean sponges and  40 species of snapping shrimps in the genus Synalpheus that live only inside sponge canals  The species of Synalpheus range from strict host specialists to relative generalists and include the only know marine eusocial animals  as well as species that live in small groups or in heterosexual pairs  The evolutionary trajectory of Synalpheus is likely linked closely to differences in their host sponges because the host  offering a protective and stable environment  governs the shrimps  geographic distribution  density  species assemblage and diet  Therefore  we tested for congruence between the evolutionary histories of Synalpheus shrimps and their sponge hosts  and asked whether the strength of congruence varies with social organization  We found that Synalpheus species did not evolve independently of their hosts  which suggests phylogenetic conservatism in their host use patterns  Moreover  eusocial species are the main contributor to the significant co phylogenetic pattern  This suggests that phylogenetic conservatism of host use is stronger for eusocial than non social Synalpheus species  Many eusocial invertebrates and vertebrates evolved under stringent habitats  In eusocial shrimps  the stronger association with closely related host sponges might lead to stronger habitat constrains and promoted the evolution of eusociality   
Climate change driven vicariance of Appalachian Trees  Although the shared history between Eastern North American and Eastern Asian forests is one of the most striking biogeographic patterns of the Northern Hemisphere  its origins remain poorly understood  Most previous studies have focused on distinguishing between different connection routes and were based on either relatively few clades or taxonomic information from floristic surveys  The increasing availability of time calibrated trees along with species geographic distribution and global paleoclimatic data presents a unique opportunity to dissect not only the timing of these disjunctions  but also which factors influence the biogeographic dynamics of Northern temperate forests  Here we integrate time calibrated phylogenies of 60 flowering plant clades  current species niches and paleoclimatic data to draw inferences on the drivers of the biogeographic history of the Appalachian woody flora  We show that historic climate change was the main factor of the biogeographic dynamics  and that clades with different temperature niches responded differently to the same paleoclimatic changes  Using a survival Bayesian model we determined that departures from a clades  inferred  temperature optimum  increased its risk of undergoing vicariance  Our work highlights the importance of taking organismal ecology into account in order to estimate meaningful biogeographic dynamics  
Broad host ranges in fungal parasites of anciently asexual bdelloid rotifers  The evolution of sex is an enduring puzzle  One hypothesis posits that antagonistic coevolution favors sexually produced offspring because they possess rare or novel genotypes that are resistant to parasites and pathogens   A corollary prediction is that obligate asexuality will persist when antagonistic coevolution is relaxed  if parasites are scarce  for example  or if hosts disperse so rapidly and independently of parasites that the two become decoupled in time and space   The latter scenario accords with studies of bdelloid rotifers  aquatic microinvertebrates that have been obligately asexual for tens of millions of years   Bdelloids disperse frequently and broadly in a desiccated state that is not tolerated by their major enemies  parasitic fungi   However  it remains unclear how strongly this dispersal ecology relaxes antagonistic coevolution  because the relevant models also hinge on the specificity of parasites to hosts  which is unknown in the bdelloid fungus system   We conducted cross inoculation experiments to determine the host range of twenty fungal parasites across seven species of bdelloid rotifers in two genera  incorporating phylogenetic effects by molecular barcoding of all taxa   We found broad intra  and even intergeneric host ranges  in contrast to the narrow ranges assumed in many coevolutionary models   However  all hosts resisted at least one parasite  and parasites varied considerably in the degree of infectivity against hosts within their range   This anciently asexual lineage therefore shows variation in susceptibility to infection  probably maintained in part because rapid migration relaxes coevolution and preserves diversity   To clarify this interpretation  coevolutionary models of sex in metapopulations should be updated to consider more generalised host parasite interaction matrixes   
Testing traits associated with low nutrient adaptation in Helianthus  Plants associated from nutrient poor habitats generally have slower growth rates  delayed flowering  and more conservative resource traits  all of which have been hypothesized to be adaptations to low nutrients   However  phenotypic selection and artificial selection experiments generally do not support these adaptive hypotheses   We conducted a simulated natural selection experiment on interspecific hybrids of Helianthus annuus x H  petiolaris under very low N conditions in order to experimentally test for traits associated with low nutrient adaptation in an herbaceous annual  The experimental design included six breeding populations that were initially started from same 18 maternal families but cross pollinated only within each population after that   Three populations served as our control populations and  for each  a random plant from each maternal family contributed progeny to the next generation   For each of the remaining 3 selected populations  the plant from each maternal family with the highest seed production contributed progeny to the next generation   After several generations  plants in the selected populations have significantly higher fitness  estimated as total seed production per plant  than plants in the control populations  The plants in the selected populations also have later budding and flowering  smaller seeds  larger stem diameter at first flower and lower leaf water content   The analyses of additional traits  biomass allocation and leaf resource use related traits  are still pending   Taken as a whole  the results will provide a robust test of traits associated with low nutrient adaptation in an herbaceous annual  
Faster rates in snakes  Molecular evolution of the insulin signaling pathway in amniotes  Metabolic differences associated with ectothermy and resistance to environmental extremes  e g  freeze  anoxia  and starvation resistance   may also result in differential selection pressures for stress and nutrient pathways in non avian reptiles than for mammals and birds  Recent studies have started to uncover clues that the genetic underpinnings of stress response are indeed very different in reptiles relative to mammals  For instance  IGF 1 contains more substitutions along the snake and lizard branch and more diversity in reptiles generally as compared to mammals  leading to the hypothesis that the insulin signaling pathway in reptiles may be considerably different from mammals  Here we provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the molecular evolution of the insulin signaling pathway to address whether components of this pathway have experienced faster evolution in snakes and lizards  To do so  we leveraged coding sequence data from 32 mammals  10 birds  and 24 non avian reptiles  the latter of which included 18 liver transcriptomes that we generated from six lizard species  seven snakes  four species of turtle  and alligator  
Genetic architecture of rapid and extreme body size evolution in an island population of house mice  Organisms on islands routinely evolve unusual body sizes over short time periods  but the genetic mechanisms underlying this evolutionary pattern remain poorly understood  As successful colonizers of islands across the globe and the targets of intense genetic study  house mice provide a model system for dissecting the genetics of island evolution  In this study  we examined the evolution of body size in the largest wild house mice in the world  which inhabit Gough Island  GI   These mice  belonging to Mus musculus domesticus  are twice the mass of their mainland counterparts  a difference that evolved during the last 100 years   To dissect the genetic architecture of gigantism in Gough Island mice  we conducted a large F2 intercross between GI mice and a smaller bodied strain  WSB   By weighing mice weekly at 16 time points  we reconstructed the growth curves of individual F2s  Mice were genotyped at more than 3 000 informative SNPs  We identified a suite of quantitative trait loci  QTL  associated with body weight  QTL ranged in phenotypic effect sizes  including a large effect locus on chromosome 10  Most QTL had additive effects on body weight and acted at multiple  contiguous ages  The GI allele increased body weight at all QTL  consistent with natural selection driving size evolution  Our results provide a rare genetic dissection of extreme body size on islands  and pave the way for identification of the mechanisms responsible for rapid evolution of size  
Linking dynamic gene expression in a cichlid key innovation to adaptive molecular evolution  Trophic divergence in cichlid fishes is linked to shifts in pharyngeal jaw morphology  The changes in the genetic and developmental architecture underlying this key innovation are largely unknown  Gene expression plasticity  or the differences in gene expression in response to changes in environment  may have large effects on the rate of gene evolution  Using next gen whole transcriptome sequencing  we measured shifts in gene expression in the muscular sling of the cichlid pharyngeal jaw in response to a diet shift in lab reared cichlids  We examined the relationship between changes in gene expression and the rate of sequence evolution  dN dS  among genes to determine if genes with high differential expression showed more adaptive divergence than did genes with low differential expression  
Diverging genomes of an emerging ecogenomic model using Restriction site Associated DNA  RAD  sequencing  Divergence landscapes provide a crucial benchmark from which to ascribe functional diversification to environmentally divergent genomes  Using ecotypes from the ecological model microcrustacean Daphnia pulex species complex  we probe the landscape of divergence and test nascent speciation hypotheses using a Restriction Site Associated DNA  RAD  Sequencing approach  Upon mapping 2 5 x 108 barcoded Illumina reads to our reference genome and calling variants via local de novo haplotype assembly  we show strong habitat based clustering between D  pulex  the vernal pond dweller  and D  pulicaria  which inhabit lakes  Moreover  D  pulex and pulicaria ecotype clustering occurs quite strongly along a single component axis when analyzed via PCA  with the variant PC loadings bearing a striking relationship to traditional variant population genetic parameters  By connecting reference sequence scaffolds to linkage groups  LGs  revealed in earlier mapping efforts  we render habitat associated divergence at the chromosomal level  Variants with known linear LG placement reveal clustered segments showing differentiation that deviates significantly from neutral expectation  and Bayesian selection detection algorithms identify variants as candidates for positive selection  Several variant loci occur within genes having associated gene ontologies  or in genes with known environmentally triggered differential expression from earlier transcriptomic inquiry  Identifying patterns of genome wide divergence is of central interest to evolutionary biologists seeking to interrogate recently sequenced genomes for signs of real world functional differentiation  
Molecular consequences of sperm competition in Agelaius blackbirds  In species with polyandry  multiple mating by females   sperm from different males compete for access to a female s eggs  Increasing polyandry can intensify selection on traits  such as proteins in the seminal fluid  that confer reproductive advantages to males  Though seminal fluid proteins  Sfps  and their evolutionary patterns have been documented in many species  they remain poorly characterized in birds  a taxon known for its polyandry but only recently studied at the molecular level  Using the Agelaius clade of New World blackbirds  I tested whether Sfps evolve faster in species with high levels of sperm competition than in species with low levels of sperm competition  I first measured the rate of extra pair paternity  EPP  in three Agelaius species as a proxy for the intensity of sperm competition  All three exhibited similar levels of EPP  including a socially monogamous island endemic  I then used a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on field collected samples to compile the first list of seminal fluid proteins in a passerine  the red winged blackbird  A  phoeniceus   Using this list  I selected and analyzed six candidate Sfps and two control genes across the three species  Preliminary results from dN dS tests revealed that not only is there no evidence for positive selection in any of these genes  there is strong evidence for purifying selection and furthermore very low levels of diversity within and divergence across species  although levels of diversity correspond with the census sizes of each species   These results contrast trends observed in non passerines and in insects and mammals  Reasons for the differences could be both microevolutionary  the Sfps examined in this study could face mixed selective pressures  including selective constraints  or macroevolutionary  birds have a much slower tempo of molecular evolution than other taxa   Additional characterization of the transcriptome  as well as further evolutionary analyses  are ongoing to place these initial findings in context  By examining the effect of mating system on protein divergence  this work links sexual selection with DNA sequence evolution while generating behavioral  genetic  transcriptomic and proteomic resources for future comparative studies  
 The root of the flowering plants  re re revisited    Most molecular evidence points to a root of flowering plant phylogeny that divides the angiosperm crown group into Amborella vs  all remaining species  However  a subset of analyses have persistently recovered alternative arrangements  typically connecting the root node between Amborella plus water lilies  vs  all other angiosperms  These results may be a result of low taxon density in angiosperms or outgroups  but concern seems warranted about this issue given the large phylogenetic distance that separates angiosperms from the other extant seed plants  a possible source of strong systematic error  Some recent publications have focused on using whole plastid genome samplings to investigate this problem  for analysis of the subset of protein coding plastid gene regions  the plastid gene set   However  the number of relevant lineages that have had their plastid genomes sequenced is still relatively sparse  Here we revisit this question with an expanded sampling of plastomes from multiple lineages around the root node of angiosperm phylogeny  We are aiming for a complete genus level sampling from the ANITA grade of angiosperms  and currently have 12 of the  15 genera represented  which we generated using genome survey sequencing and de novo assembly  Our sampling includes multiple outgroups and other angiosperms  in addition to multiple representatives of the aquatic family Hydatellaceae  Nymphaeales   We also sequenced full plastid circles for a representative subset of taxa to investigate genome structural evolution among these lineages  which define the earliest splits in angiosperm phylogeny  
An ecological diversification history of marine animals  The ecological diversity of marine animals is widely assumed to be greater today than at any point in Earth s history  However  unlike taxonomic diversity  the ecological diversification history of marine animals has not previously been quantified in a single systematic framework across time  To address this knowledge gap  we present new ecological data on 22 000 extinct and extant genera of bilaterian marine animals   85  of such animals in the fossil record  We based ecological assignments on the first principles of functional morphology for three fundamental niche axes  habitat tiering in relation to the seafloor  feeding mode  and motility level  that combine to describe the  ecospace  utilization of each taxon  These assignments indicate at least a six fold increase in ecospace utilization between the Cambrian  542   485 Ma  and the present day  Moreover  ecospace genus diversity relationships were dissimilar during the Cambrian  the remainder of the Paleozoic  485   252 Ma   the Mesozoic  252   66 Ma   and the Cenozoic  66 Ma   Recent  with progressively increased ecospace utilization for any equivalent number of genera from one interval to the next  We also find that the oceans have not only become increasingly ecologically complex across time  but that high energy demanding modes of life  e g   fully motile predators and grazers  have become increasingly common  Further  whereas mass extinctions permanently eliminated many taxa  they eliminated a very small proportion of ecospace  In contrast  many new ecospaces first appear during recovery intervals in the first ten million years following the Permo Triassic and Cretacecous Paleogene mass extinctions  Mass extinctions appear not only to have enabled adaptive radiation of existing types replacing previously dominant forms  but also to have opened fundamentally new opportunities in restructured ecosystems  
Examining the presence of a geographic mosaic of coevolution in the walnut aphid biological control system  The introduction of Trioxys pallidus to the walnut growing regions of California led to the successful control of the walnut aphid  Chromaphis juglandicola   which was once a primary pest  However  in recent years  spray treatments are again being used in mid late summer  Central to the sustainability of classical biological control programs is the concept that co evolutionary forces will provide permanent and sustainable control after a pest is reunited with its natural enemies  The geographic mosaic theory of co evolution predicts a patchy landscape to exist  both with  hot spots  where co evolutionary forces are strong  and  cold spots  where they are weak  This patchy landscape seems similar to patterns observed in the walnut orchards of California  where some orchards require pesticide treatments and others do not  Using a population genomics approach to investigating the geographic mosaic of co evolution  as per Vermeer et al  2011  we have genotyped individuals of T  pallidus and C  juglandicola from geographically distinct parts of the walnut growing region of California   Our results indicate that Fst values for examined microsatellite loci vary by location as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory  With these results we plan to address what role the geographic mosaic of co  evolution may have in providing sustainable biological control services in the walnut aphid T  pallidus system  
Molecular evolution of anthocyanin pigment genes during flower color transitions  Understanding the predictability of genetic changes associated with phenotypic evolution is a main focus of evolutionary biology  In the Iochrominae clade  Solanaceae   losses of floral anthocyanin pigments have resulted in multiple transitions from blue to white or yellow phenotypes  This repeated evolution of floral color presents an ideal opportunity to determine if repeated phenotypic transitions involve similar genetic changes and have consistent consequences for subsequent evolution of pathway genes  Here  we test the hypothesis that pigment pathway genes experience changes in selective pressure during and following losses of floral pigmentation  Focusing on three genes  CHI  F3H  DFR   we find that white flowered lineages have maintained full coding length sequences with no clear evidence of pseudogenization   However  maximum likelihood analyses reveal that all of the genes have higher ratios of non synonymous and synonymous substitutions  dN dS  in white vs  blue lineages  consistent with relaxed constraint or selection for new functions following the color shifts   These results support the hypothesis that transitions from blue to white flowers  and the associated losses of anthocyanin production lead to predictable changes in selection pressures on pigment pathway genes   
 A Complex History of Diversification  Dispersal  and Introgression in the Notropis rubellus  Teleostei  Cyprinidae  species group   Mitochondrial and nuclear introgression result in incongruence among gene trees  and can greatly complicate the process of species tree reconstruction  which in turn makes it difficult to accurately reconstruct the history of dispersal and diversification within a group  In the Central Highlands of North America  the Appalachian  Ozark  and Ouachita Mountains  multiple clades of fishes have been diversifying extensively since the Miocene  resulting in the highest diversity of freshwater fishes to be found outside the tropics  Multi locus phylogenies of the taxa which took part in this diversification are revealing new details of the temporal and geographical context of this diversification  One such taxon is the Notropis rubellus species group  a complex of eight distinct lineages within the highly diverse freshwater fish family Cyprinidae  It ranges throughout eastern North America  including the Central Highlands  and has also dispersed northward into formerly glaciated regions  Though a mitochondrial phylogeny of the group exists  the basal relationships within the group are unresolved  hindering reconstruction of its history  In this talk  I present a new multi locus species tree analysis of the group  with the addition of five nuclear loci  relationships between lineages within the group are fully resolved  Most of the diversification within the group is Pleistocene in age  this contrasts with considerably older divergence dates seen in many sympatric species  Further  the species tree analysis suggests that introgression  both mitochondrial and nuclear  has played a role in the diversification of the group  resulting in a reticulate history for the origin of some populations   The temporal incongruence and with the role of introgression in the diversification history of the Notropis rubellus species group hints at a high level of complexity in the history of dispersal and diversification in the fishes of the North American Central Highlands  Though introgression complicates the reconstruction of accurate species trees  it appears that species tree analyses  if interpreted correctly  may also be helpful in determining that introgression has occurred  and which lineages were involved  
Epistatic interactions are prevalent in Drosophila 3 UTR evolution Untranslated transcribed regions  UTRs  contain cis regulatory information allowing post transcriptional control of mRNA and protein levels   Evolutionary analyses in Drosophila have revealed that UTRs are highly constrained sequences and have been inferred to be the targets of frequent adaptive substitution  We develop a powerful transgenic assay to quantify the effects of 3 UTR sequence divergence between two closely related Drosophila species on transcript and protein abundance  We find that the expression divergence encoded by 3 UTR sequence divergence is frequently associated with non additive interactions among substitutions that distinguish the two species  We further show that the extent and direction of non additivity can vary depending on the level of regulation and in a tissue specific manner  Our results have important implications for the rate and trajectories of adaptive regulatory evolution as well our ability to reliably predict phenotype from genotype 
Patterns of introgression between sympatric Mimulus species divergent for flowering phenology and mating system  Naturally hybridizing species present an opportunity to investigate the evolutionary processes that contribute to speciation  What are the genetic mechanisms and ecological factors that maintain species in sympatry  What proportion of the genome contributes to local adaptation and or reproductive isolation  We begin to explore these key questions in two closely related species of Mimulus that differ in flowering phenology and mating system  M  nasutus is highly selfing and flowers rapidly under the relatively short day length of early spring  whereas M  guttatus is predominantly outcrossing and remains vegetative until the days become longer  When populations are sympatric  these phenotypic and ecological differences have profound effects on reproductive isolation between species  In this study  we characterize flowering phenology and genomic variation between M  nasutus and M  guttatus within a focal sympatric population  We document ongoing  asymmetrical gene flow from M  nasutus into M  guttatus  with a spectrum of admixture from early generation hybrids to late generation hybrids and mostly  pure  M  guttatus individuals  Associations between microhabitat  phenology and genomic composition indicate that recent hybrids occur in intermediate environments and have intermediate flowering times between M  nasutus and M  guttatus  Lastly  to address whether particular genomic regions contribute to the maintenance of species divergence  we quantify patterns of introgression across the genome  These results represent a detailed view of how ecological divergence and gene flow may contribute to patterns of introgression between Mimulus species  
Timing the diversification of the Amazonian biota  butterfly divergences are consistent with Pleistocene refugia  Rejection of the Pleistocene refugium hypothesis  PRH  as an explanation for the high biodiversity of Neotropical forest is based in part on the assertion that biotic elements of these forests evolved during the Neogene  That argument is justified  in turn  by the ages of crown groups  the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant species of a clade   We consider the use of crown ages as a metric to reject the PRH to be an unfair test  because the circumscription of crown groups of interest is arbitrary  and their ages represent overestimates of the time of species formation  I will present divergence times between pairs of sister species  131 pairs   and among pairs of sister species and their closest relative  56 triplets   from 35 genera of Neotropical butterflies  aiming to refocus the discussion about the timing of diversification of the Neotropical biota on the time of the formation of extant species  a metric that is consistent and comparable across taxa  Results from our study show that 72  of speciation events leading to the formation of butterfly sister species occurred within the last 2 6 Myr  a result consistent with the temporal predictions of the PRH  suggesting that the PRH cannot be completely discarded as a driver of Neotropical diversification  
Genetic structure of parasitoids in a fragmented landscape  Species living in a fragmented landscape exhibit high spatial structure  Depending on their movement in the landscape  limited gene flow between local populations  drift and founder effects play a significant role in shaping of the overall genetic population structure  The genetic structure exhibited by interacting species at multiple trophic level system can differ significantly depending on resource specialization and dispersal behaviour  The Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia  lives as a metapopulation in the Aland islands  a 50 x 70 km archipelago  where it hosts multiple parasitoid species at different trophic levels  The host butterfly is highly differentiated spatially and genetically in the fragmented landscape  We compared the genetic structure of the specialist parasitoid  Hyposoter horticola  and hyperparasitoid  Mesochorus stigmaticus  that depend on the butterfly  using microsatellite data developed for the respective species  We found the parasitoids to be hierarchically genetically structured but the level of differentiation and isolation by distance was weak in comparison to the host butterfly  While the parasitoid and hyperparasitoid are more dispersive than the butterfly  they are constrained by its dispersal ability and distribution in the landscape  Studying the population differentiation of these strongly interacting species at different trophic levels helps us understand the influence of landscape fragmentation on demographic histories and evolution of spatial genetic structure  
Dynamic gradients of river systems mediating dispersal and vicariance of fishes  Hypothesized mechanisms of diversification for many lotic  freshwater fishes focus on dramatic geologic events such as glaciations and river re arrangement  However  these vicariant events do not explain all of the standing diversity and often ignore the requirement of dispersal  For instance  within North America there are groups of endemic species within the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers  in the Eastern Highland region  that diversified within these drainages without the influence of dramatic geologic events  Hypotheses of the mechanism s of speciation within such drainages are vague at best and are usually limited to references about long term geologic stability  We discuss likely mechanisms of within drainage diversification based on time calibrated phylogenies of percids and North American cyprinids  Specifically  we outline expectations of phylogeographic patterns resulting from the erosional differences of underlying geology and epeirogeny acting within these drainages  We propose that stochastic rates of erosion and epeirogeny have resulted in on going cycles of dispersal and isolation of fishes within these otherwise geologically stable rivers  
Darwin s conundrum revisited  does phylogenetic distance predict invasibility   A key goal of invasion biology is to identify the factors that favor species invasions  One potential indicator of invasiveness is the phylogenetic distance between a non native species and species in the recipient community  However  predicting invasiveness using phylogenetic information relies on an untested assumption  that both biotic resistance and facilitation weaken with increasing phylogenetic distance  We test the validity of this key assumption using a mathematical model in which a novel species is introduced into communities with varying ecological and phylogenetic relationships  Contrary to what is generally assumed  we find that biotic resistance and facilitation can either weaken or intensify with phylogenetic distance  depending on the mode of interspecific interactions  phenotype matching or phenotype differences  and the resulting evolutionary trajectory of the recipient community  Thus  we demonstrate that considering the mechanisms that drive phenotypic divergence between native and non native species can provide critical insight into the relationship between phylogenetic distance and invasibility  
Maintenance of a conserved trait  natural selection on stamen lengths in wild radish  Tetradynamy  the presence of four long and two short stamens within each flower  is a diagnostic trait of the mustard family Brassicaceae  but the reasons for the maintenance of this trait across most of the 3700+ species in the family are unknown   Previous functional studies of pollen removal and selection through male fitness  seed siring success  suggested that the short stamens function to reduce per visit pollen removal  which increases male fitness under high pollinator visitation rates  Conner et al  2003 Evolution   To further test this hypothesis  we expanded the phenotypic variance of the difference in stamen heights through artificial selection  and measured selection on this trait across multiple days that naturally varied in pollinator visitation rate   
Selection on phenotypic traits in an experimentally introduced population of Brassica rapa in a novel environment  Examining the strength of selection on phenotypic traits over time can provide information on the targets and consistency of selective pressure  Due to the global mobility of humans  and therefore propagules  the selective pressures on  and evolutionary responses of  colonizing organisms are of particular concern  Much of the work on the selection and evolution of introduced species has been conducted after the introductions have occurred  leaving many factors uncontrolled or unobserved  This study examines the selection on phenotypic traits in a population of experimentally introduced plants in the first three seasons following introduction to a novel environment  My goals are to determine the phenotypic targets of selection and if the strength of selection changes during the first three generations following introduction  The experimental introduction occurred in May 2011  when Brassica rapa  field mustard  seeds from a population in the Mediterranean climate of Southern California were introduced to the temperate climate of New York  A variety of morphological and phenological traits were measured twice a week throughout the growing seasons  During the first two seasons of growth  2011 and 2012   there was significant direct linear selection for increased size  greater basal stem diameter  Bavg 0 487  and number of leaves  Bavg 0 579    During the third growing season  2013   when weather patterns were more severe  there was no significant selection for increased size  but rather significant direct linear selection for longer duration of flowering  B 0 386   This suggests that during a period of severe weather  there was direct selection for plants that were able to flower longer to maximize seed set  rather than direct selection on increased overall size during the moderate growing seasons of the previous two years  A common garden experiment using the resurrection approach of comparing the growth stored ancestors from the source population and descendants from the introduced population will be a definitive test of evolution since introduction   
Phenotypic and ecological divergence between closely related and reproductively isolated sympatric species of Mimulus  The evolution of ecological differences and reproductive isolation are necessary for secondary sympatry and stable coexistence of closely related species  Without reproductive isolation  incipient species will hybridize and fuse back together into a single species  and without ecological differences competitive exclusion will result local extinction  Species that presently co occur may have evolved ecological differences while physically separated  or they may have evolved differences in the same area through selection to minimize hybridization or competition  Little is known about the ecological trait differences that allow species to coexist and their genetic basis  Mimulus guttatus  a western North American wildflower  and its sister species Mimulus nudatus co occur on serpentine soils in northern California but live in distinct microhabitats that differ in the onset of summer drought  These species are a classic system for investigating the ecology and genetics of reproductive isolation  Pollinator constancy causes partial prezygotic isolation  but seed lethality is the primary barrier to hybridization between them  M  nudatus grows on serpentine slopes that dry out early in the spring  while M  guttatus inhabits ephemeral streams where drought imposed death is later than in the M  nudatus habitat  These habitats can be very close to one another  within a scale of several meters  so habitat partitioning is on the scale of dispersal and gene flow  M  nudatus possesses several traits that are likely adaptations to earlier drought  including narrow leaves  shorter critical photoperiod  earlier flowering time and bolting from more basal nodes than M  guttatus  These phenotypic differences are hypothesized to enable coexistence by contributing to niche differentiation and minimizing interspecific competition  Sympatric and allopatric populations of each species were grown in common gardens to quantify ecologically important trait differences  Sympatric populations of M  nudatus have narrower leaves and smaller flowers than M  guttatus  Sympatric populations of M  nudatus also exhibit rapid development characteristic of plants that inhabit marginal habitats  they germinate later  but flower earlier than sympatric populations of M  guttatus  We have also identified several QTL underlying differences in leaf shape  critical photoperiod and bolting  Future work will determine how these loci contribute to microhabitat differentiation and species interactions  
Periodic Social Niche construction  Social niche construction describes the creation of social networks and institutions that influence individual fitness  Niche construction involves multiple timescales  including the relatively short time required to build a niche  and the longer time required to learn how to build a niche   We explore a number of different learning rules for niche construction and deconstruction in relation to competition between constructing species or agents  We are particularly interested in the dynamics of institutional switching  Using a learning rule in which construction effort is proportional to the effort put in by competing agents generates cycles in population density  Technically  the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with a transition from a stable solution to a periodic solution  Hysteresis  path dependence  in key competition parameters provides evidence of top down causal memory from the institutions  leading to increased resistance to change between stable and periodic states  This is due to the different stability criteria for a periodic solution as dictated by Floquet s theory  We also find evidence for greater stability in a two niche or institution setting than a single institution setting  We relate these results to prior discussion of stability induced in bi polar versus unipolar social systems  
Genetics of hybrid lethality between sympatric Mimulus species A fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is identifying the traits and genes that underlie reproductive isolation and the mechanisms that drive their evolution  
Genomic insights into a specialized pathogen of the fungus growing ant symbiosis  The highly evolved agricultural lifestyle of leaf cutting ants has attracted particular attention because these ants cultivate a symbiotic fungus in specialized chambers of their nests  The ants cut leaves  preprocess them into small pieces  and feed them to the symbiotic fungus  which  in turn  serves as their major food source  These ant farmers have been cultivating fungi for at least 50 million years  Like human agriculture  ant agriculture is hampered by disease  The ants  fungal crops are attacked by fungal pathogens in the genus Escovopsis  which are believed to have evolved in association with the ants and their fungi for millions of years  Escovopsis infection can have detrimental impacts on garden health and  consequently  on the survival of ant colonies  Escovopsis spp  have never been isolated outside of fungus growing ant colonies  and different strains of Escovopsis are capable of attacking the fungi grown by different fungus growing ant species  The long term  specialized evolutionary history of the association between Escovopsis spp  and their hosts provides a unique venue for exploring the consequences of host specialization on pathogen genome evolution  Analysis of the first available genome sequence of an Escovopsis strain isolated from a fungus growing ant colony indicates that the pathogen has a small genome compared to those of previously sequenced ascomycete fungi  Escovopsis is also predicted to have fewer genes than close relatives and is missing genes thought to be important in breaking down plant material  In contrast  Escovopsis has maintained several genes coding for terpene synthases  which could facilitate breakdown of its host fungus  These insights provide a starting point for investigating the genomic changes that underlie pathogen specialization across this ancient symbiotic association   
Accounting for Horizontal Gene Transfer in Coalescent based Phylogenetic Inference in Multi locus Viral Genome Using a Pruning Algorithm  Horizontal gene transfer is a fairly common feature in viral genome  Most traditional coalescent framework does not have an explicit mechanism for taking into account of horizontal gene transfer  as a result  the viral phylogenetic trees estimated based on such framework are often inaccurate  Here we present a novel phylogenetic technique that accounts for horizontal gene transfer in phylogenetic inference in a coalescent based model of viral evolution  First  the likelihoods of local phylogenetic sub tree are computed for each locus using a pruning algorithm  Then  the likelihood at each locus at each sub tree is tested for identifying outliers  i e  evidence for horizontal gene transfer   and then the final tree overall is estimated excluding the identified regions and loci consisting of horizontal gene transfer  Later these regions and loci are analyzed separately to identify the nature of horizontal gene transfer  While estimating the overall tree and sub trees  a pruning algorithm based likelihood approach is used  Our method does not use MCMC algorithms  and as a result the process is computationally fast  We also establish through simulation studies that these estimation process has a high degree of accuracy  
The genetic basis of adaptation to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus  While local adaptation has been frequently demonstrated via reciprocal transplant experiments  our understanding of the genetic basis of it remains minimal  There is a notable lack of studies that identify naturally segregating variants  determine the traits controlled by these variants and characterize their fitness effects in the field  Such studies are critical for understanding how spatially varying selective pressures can drive population divergence and maintain genetic variation  The experiments presented here aim to characterize the genetic basis of local adaptation to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus  First  I show that serpentine and non serpentine populations of M  guttatus are locally adapted to soil habitat wherein non serpentine plants are unable to survive on serpentine soils  Serpentine tolerance appears to come at a cost as serpentine plants are smaller than non serpentine plants when growing on non serpentine soils which may limit their competitive ability  Next I identify environmental variables that are important selective agents in the serpentine habitat  Using hydroponic assays to isolate individual chemical variables of serpentine soils  I show that serpentine and non serpentine populations of M  guttatus have significant differences in tolerance to low calcium to magnesium ratio  low Ca Mg ratio  as well as high nickel  I then characterize the genetic basis of these ecotypic differences in survival and tolerance using QTL mapping  I identify a single  major QTL the controls both the ability to survive on serpentine soils and tolerance to low Ca Mg ratio  This suggests that M  guttatus populations have adapted to serpentine soils through an ability to tolerate the low levels of Ca while simultaneously not suffering from Mg toxicity  Furthermore  I show that this same QTL controls ability to survive on serpentine soils in a second  geographically distant population  however  preliminary work suggests that the two populations are not equally tolerant to each other s soils indicating that either other loci are involved or that different serpentine tolerance alleles at this QTL are not functionally equivalent  This work addresses long standing questions in evolutionary biology regarding the number and effect size of loci that underlie adaptive traits by identifying a large effect locus that contributes to adaptive differences between M  guttatus populations  
Anchored phylogenomics and transcriptomics  comparisons between two next gen data collection approaches used for estimating deep level relationships o  Butterflies and moths are some of the most charismatic and well known insects  Relationships between major butterfly and moth superfamilies  especially those among the megadiverse clade Ditrysia  remain largely uncertain  Our recent application of transcriptomic data  938 genes  to lepidopteran phylogenetics resulted in strong support for challenging inter familial relationships  such as those within the superfamily Bombycoidea  In the present study  for transcriptomes analysis we present a new Lepidoptera specific core ortholog set for use in the program Hamstr built from 6 568 putative single copy orthologs and an anchored phylogenomics probe set of 855 genes that successfully captures targets across the diversity of lepidopteran superfamilies  We sampled taxa from 19 superfamilies across the Lepidoptera and generated transcriptomes and anchored hybrid enrichment data to estimate higher relationships of this diverse insect order  We compare the resulting topologies and node support from several different data sets and discuss the benefits and shortcoming of the two methods  One striking result was the strong support for the placement of butterflies within the lower microlepidopteran grade of superfamilies in nearly all of our analyses  Furthermore  our results indicate that nucleotide saturation  especially at the third codon position  affect both types of data and must be accounted for when estimating deep level lepidopteran relationships 
Lessons for phylogenomics analyses based on 48 bird genomes  Reconstructing the history of rapid radiations is one of the most challenging problems in phylogenetic reconstruction  at least partly due to rampant incomplete lineage sorting that is caused by short divergence times  Some have argued that genome scale data can solve such problems  A recent phylogenomic project sequenced and analyzed 48 bird species representing every generally accepted order of Neoaves  a group hypothesized to have undergone a rapid radiation  Analyzing this huge dataset presented many challenges  and in particular  coalescence based analyses of the genome scale data using summary methods such as MP EST proved challenging  One major issue was that many gene trees had extremely poor resolution  a problem that is typically addressed by filtering out such genes  We developed new ways of addressing this problem through a statistical binning approach that divides the genes into groups called supergenes  Multiple genes are put into the same group if no statistically meaningful conflict between their gene trees is detected  We then used a concatenation approach to build supergene trees  and applied a coalescence based summary method  such as MP EST  to these supergene trees  We showed in simulation and biological studies that this binning approach resulted in improved accuracy  A statistical binning analyses of the avian data produced trees that were broadly congruent with concatenation results  but also had interesting differences with it  Here  we present these and other advancements in application of coalescence based summary methods to genome scale data   
The effect of plasticity and viability costs of proteins on the evolution of seminal fluid composition  Seminal fluid proteins  Sfps  of many internally fertilizing species are some of the fastest evolving molecules in animals  The influence of these proteins on male success in sperm competition and their role in sexual conflict contribute to the strong positive selection acting on these proteins  Production of Sfps has been shown to be energetically expensive and time consuming  The evolution of male investment of resources in different kinds of Sfps  however  has only recently received empirical attention  and has not yet been addressed with formal theory  Here we present analysis of a model of evolution of seminal fluid composition  In spite of their diverse functions  Sfps involved in sperm competition increase male fitness in one of three ways    1   avoidance  proteins help males avoid direct sperm competition  e g  by delaying female remating  2   defense  proteins help males defend their sperm from displacement by the female s subsequent mate  and 3   offense  proteins aid males in displacing sperm of preceding males  We studied how male investment in these three categories of Sfps evolves in the light of sperm competition  Our previous results indicate the evolution of a single optimal strategy in seminal fluid composition based on the efficiencies of these proteins  Here we present an analysis of the effects of plasticity in male investment in Sfps and different viability costs of Sfps on the evolutions of seminal fluid composition  We incorporate plasticity in the model by allowing males to alter their seminal fluid composition prior to mating based on the mating status of the female  Males mating with virgin females reallocate resources towards avoidance and defense proteins  whereas males mating with females that have previously mated reallocate resources towards offense proteins  We find that plasticity in male investment has a complex set of unintuitive effects on the evolution of seminal fluid composition  In contrast with scenarios without plasticity  plasticity allows the existence of multiple optimal seminal fluid compositions at the genotypic level  Our results indicate that across populations  plasticity can facilitate the maintenance of not only phenotypic  but also genetic variation in seminal fluid composition  The level of plasticity also alters the seminal fluid composition that evolves in a population  At high levels of plasticity males evolve to invest only in avoidance and lose investment in defense  We also find that if Sfps incur a viability cost on males  males evolve to make smaller investments in the costlier proteins  
Major Ecological Shifts both Promote and Retard Speciation in Timema Stick Insects  This study investigates the consequences of level of ecological divergence  taxonomic disparity of host plants  for habitat isolation and sexual isolation across dozens of independent allopatric and parapatric population pairs of Timema while controlling for genetic distance in order to evaluate the generality of ecological speciation across this genus  Ecological divergence is not associated with sexual isolation and no evidence of reinforcement of sexual isolation was found  However  Ecological divergence was strongly associated with habitat divergence  Moreoever  habitat divergence was inversely related to sexual isolation among parapatric but not sympatric population pairs  This suggests that habitat isolation is interfering with reinforcing selection by reducing the frequency of interpopulation matings on which reinforcing selection depends   Thus  major shifts in host use seem to be driving speciation via habitat isolation  which in turn is retarding speciation by negating reinforcement  
Testing models of recent demographic history with genome scale data  a case study of the meltwater stonefly  Lednia tumana   One of the promises of genome scale data is the ability to accurately deduce the recent demographic history of populations of interest  To date  few empirical studies have bridged the gap between this promise and reality   Here  we leverage restriction site associated DNA  RAD  sequencing to collect genome wide data for assessing the recent demographic history of the meltwater stonefly  Lednia tumana  Plecoptera  Nemouridae   L  tumana is a rare  endemic species found only in alpine streams of Glacier National Park  GNP   Montana  The range and demographic history of L  tumana has likely been heavily impacted by receding glacial mass since the Last Glacial Maximum  For this study  we collected RAD sequencing data for 96 individuals representing nine populations across the known range of L  tumana and analyzed these data in both a coalescent and ABC framework  With expected complete glacial recession in GNP in the decades to come  L  tumana is representative of a highly threatened community of aquatic invertebrates with an uncertain future as climate change proceeds   Our results not only inform the utility of using large scale SNP data sets for recent demographic analysis but may also shed light on how this climate change sensitive species will be impacted by global warming  
Piscivorous fish in a fishless environment  predicting ecological and phenotypic differentiation of bigmouth sleepers in Bahamas blue holes  Environmental variation drives ecological and phenotypic change  But how predictable is population differentiation in response to environmental change  We address this question in bigmouth sleeper  Gobiomorus dormitor  populations following the colonization of inland blue holes differing in the availability of fish prey  We develop and test predictions of differences in population demographics  habitat use  diet  locomotor and trophic morphology  and feeding kinematics and performance between bigmouth sleeper populations inhabiting blue holes with and without potential fish prey  We found that populations of G  dormitor independently diverged between prey regimes  with broad agreement between observed differences and a priori predictions  For instance  in populations lacking fish prey  we observed male biased sex ratios  greater use of shallow water habitat  and larger population diet breadths owing to greater individual diet specialization  We further found predictable differences in aspects of body shape  mouth morphology  suction generation capacity  strike kinematics  and feeding performance on different prey types  consistent with G  dormitor adaptation to piscivory when coexisting with fish prey and to feeding on small invertebrates in the absence of fish prey  Our results suggest great promise in our ability to predict population responses to changing environments  an increasingly important capability in a human dominated  ever changing world   
 Selection  drift and plasticity contribute to sensory trait variation in echolocating bats   Across heterogeneous environments adaptive trait differentiation in the absence of gene flow is commonly reported  But this relationship is clearly more nuanced because ample evidence also supports trait differentiation in the presence of gene flow  highlighting the role of local selection gradients across different environments  If the selection gradient is steep enough to reduce immigrant fitness the effects of gene flow on trait variation may be minimised  while if selection is weak and there are minimal costs to immigration  even nominal gene flow will limit local adaptation  But variation in adaptive traits is also influenced by genetic drift and disentangling the relative affects of these processes in natural populations remains a challenge  Here we explore the evolution of sensory trait variation in two closely related bats  the Cape and Dent s horseshoe bats of southern Africa  Both species occur along substantial environmental gradients of increasing aridity and use echolocation frequencies  as measured by resting frequency  RF  that appear attuned to local environmental conditions for enhanced hunting success  To test the general hypothesis of  adaptive differentiation with minimal gene flow  we measured resting frequencies across both species  distributions and estimated long term patterns of gene flow using mitochondrial DNA sequence data  Our analyses revealed geographically structured patterns of increasing RF in both species  however drift does not contribute equally to our two study systems  While extensive trait differentiation is best explained by habitat discontinuities across the distribution of Cape horseshoe bats  this has evolved in the presence of extensive gene flow  Here  local selection for both increased detection distance in relatively less cluttered habitats together with adaptive phenotypic plasticity may have influenced the evolution of matched echolocation frequencies and habitats in this species  despite gene flow  In contrast  echolocation variation in Dent s horseshoe bat is best explained by drift  where minimal gene flow characterises the system and trait variation is not well explained by habitat structure and environmental variables  Our results emphasise the importance of population level analyses to better understand adaptive trait evolution  particularly across highly variable environments  and draws attention to the rather neglected  and possibly important  role of plasticity in the echolocation behaviour of bats   
Did the serpentine sunflower originate on serpentine soil  A population genomics analysis of Helianthus bolanderi  Serpentine soil is a challenging environment for plants due to its high levels of heavy metals and skewed Ca Mg ratio  While many plants found on serpentine soil are restricted to serpentine  others are found on both serpentine and non serpentine soil  Reciprocal transplant experiments have shown that these species are often locally adapted to their home soil environment  This would suggest that gene flow between soil types and the founding of cross soil populations should be difficult  Thus  the relationships between populations inhabiting different soil provides insight into how local adaptation proceeds    One species found on serpentine and non serpentine soil is the serpentine sunflower  Helianthus bolanderi  We sampled populations across its entire native range in northern California and genotyped them using Genotyping By Sequencing  GBS   Population structure analysis identified two groups corresponding to the east and west populations  Non serpentine populations occur in both groupings  suggesting multiple transitions between soil types  We used the directionality index  psi  to triangulate the origin of the species on a serpentine patch in the coast mountain range  Lastly  we estimated gene flow between soil types and found little evidence for reduced migration between soils  Taken together  this suggests H  bolanderi originated on serpentine and transitioned onto normal soil with relative ease  
Are female mating decisions adaptive when environments vary  A test using natural resource variation  Female mate choice can vary according to environmental context  In some cases females appear to avoid mating with males who developed in a context other than where offspring will be produced  It is unknown whether this pattern of mate choice is adaptive  Leaf footed cactus bugs  Narnia femorata  provided an opportunity to test if this pattern of context dependent female mate choice is adaptive  In this species males defend distinctly different cactus territories   those with or without a high quality resource  cactus fruit  We previously found evidence that females discriminate against males reared without fruit only when they encounter those males in territories with fruit  that is  they discriminate against males when male and offspring developmental environments do not match  We examined the fitness consequences of mate choice across contexts  We found cactus context  but not sire phenotype influenced female fecundity and reproductive success  as well as offspring adult body size and weapon size  Thus  we did not find conclusive evidence that this form of context dependent mate choice is adaptive  
Evolutionary Capacitance in Sex Determination  The heterogametic XY sex chromosome pair determines male development in therian mammals  A Y chromosome linked gene  Sry  encoding an architectural transcription factor  initiates the male specific gene regulatory network leading to the male phenotype  Reduced transcriptional activity of human SRY below a critical threshold causes 46  XY gonadal dysgenesis and in turn somatic sex reversal  Atypical Sry genes found in the rodent superfamily Muroidea possess a microsatellite encoded tail domain that functions to buffer variation in the rest of the protein  The DNA microsatellite is analogous to a capacitor as it stores charge  genetic variation  in an electrical circuit  Loss of the tail domain through microsatellite instability  discharge of the capacitor  can reduce the tail length below its functional threshold and thereby unmask accumulated variation in the Sry protein engendering developmental chaos in gonadogenesis  A model for studies of this evolutionary mechanism is provided by the grass mice of genus Akodon  whose species specific Sry variant contains a foreshortened tail associated with reduced transcriptional activity  Notably  several Akodon species have a high proportion of fertile XY females in wild populations  We propose that Akodon Sry offers a snapshot of rapid evolution following discharge of this microsatellite derived genetic capacitor  We envisage that more extreme divergence of sex determination systems in Muroidea  including loss of Sry and even the entire Y chromosome  is a direct consequence of DNA microsatellite instability unique to this taxon of mammals   
Genomic discord at different stages of divergence with gene flow in six lineages of Holarctic ducks  Divergence with gene flow may be an important mode of speciation for Holarctic taxa that have experienced opportunities for intercontinental gene flow during cycles of range expansions and contractions throughout the Quaternary  To test this hypothesis we sequenced 21 independent loci for six lineages of Holarctic ducks  genus Anas  in a replicated study design  taxonomically spanning population to species level divergences among the six pairwise comparisons  We predicted  1  genetic differentiation between Eurasia and North America   2  evidence of intercontinental gene flow  and  3  heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation among loci  Divergence between Eurasia and North America has occurred in mtDNA for five of the six lineages  and in 2 11 nuclear loci  nuDNA  for four lineages  Coalescent analyses revealed significant evidence of intercontinental gene flow in all cases  Finally  mtDNA differentiation was stronger than expected given background levels of nuDNA divergence in four lineages  and three nuDNA loci  CHD1Z  LDHB    CRYAB  were significant outliers for divergence among three lineages  suggesting that selection has affected these loci in parallel among some lineages  Although male biased gene flow likely contributed to mito nuclear discordance  the observed heterogeneity within nuDNA suggests a prominent role of divergence with gene flow for Holarctic ducks  Our results show that the Holarctic is rich in opportunities to study evolutionary processes shaping divergence and gene flow across a continuum of speciation stages  
Ecological Correlates of Body Size Change in Island Populations of Wild House Mice  The  Island Rule  states that small mammals evolve larger body sizes on islands whereas large mammals reduce their sizes  The search for evolutionary and ecological mechanisms behind this phenomenon has focused on patterns observed across species  Although this approach has been useful  it necessarily conflates many factors that could influence patterns of body size   We evaluate the ecological correlates of body size in a widespread mammal  House mice  Mus musculus   which have a nearly global geographic range  including many islands  This wide distribution of mice on islands with variable biotic and abiotic environments creates a valuable resource to understand how natural selection shapes body size change in populations with limited gene flow  To identify factors responsible for body size evolution over shorter timescales  we analyzed published body masses for island populations from a single house mouse subspecies  Mus musculus domesticus  Across 43 islands  we compared body mass to a series of abiotic and biotic variables  geographic location  island area  island perimeter  temperature  irradiance  human population size and density  avian predators  mammalian predators  and mammalian competitors  Using multiple linear regression  analysis of covariance  and Bayesian model averaging  we found that mice had a significantly lower body mass on islands with three or more avian predator species and on islands with at least one mammalian predator species  Collectively  several abiotic variables  including temperature range and irradiance explained a moderate amount of the body weight variation seen from island to island   These environmental correlates suggest that the interplay of predators  resource availability  and energetic demands are critical contributing factors to the evolution of body size for this species on islands   In addition to informing the possible sources of selection behind the  Island rule  often observed in insular species  these results highlight how studying species with cosmopolitan distributions can inform our understanding of broad patterns of evolution and also illustrate the capacity for significant biogeographic variation  
Extending the concept of diversity partitioning to characterize phenotypic complexity  Many if not most phenotypes can be considered complex traits  consisting of multiple subsidiary parts that function and evolve as integrated units  These trait complexes vary qualitatively in their individual components  e g   chemical compounds  cell types  genes expressed  and quantitatively in the counts  concentrations  or amounts of those components  As trait complexity increases  so does the challenge of measuring and analyzing that complexity in intuitive yet biologically meaningful ways that capture both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the variation  Ecologists have long formalized community complexity in terms of well known diversity indices  We extend that conceptual framework to describe phenotypic complexity as the diversity or effective number of distinct subsidiary traits making up an individual s phenotype  Then  using a hierarchical framework  we illustrate how the total phenotypic diversity within a particular level  e g   individual  species  life history strategy  can be partitioned into within group  i e     diversity  average effective number of subsidiary traits in a replicate  and between group components    diversity  effective number of completely dissimilar trait combinations   We then demonstrate the utility of our method with an example from the evolutionary ecology of chemical defense to illustrate biologically significant differences in complexity and diversity that standard analyses would not reveal  Our unified  hierarchical view of complexity and diversity shows how analytical methods developed in population genetics and community ecology can be used to characterize complex phenotypes  and helps place questions about the ecology and evolution of complexity in a population community context   
General extensions of Qst Fst for detecting adaptation in quantitative traits  Understanding how adaptation has shaped variation across populations for a wide array of traits is a topic of great interest in evolutionary biology  One commonly used tool to aid in this endeavor is the Q st F st comparison  In the simplest version  one measures the fraction of additive genetic variance for a quantitative trait that is among populations rather than within  Q st   and then compares that value to F st  an identical measure for neutral genetic variation  Under a set of restrictive assumptions  Q st will be equal to F st on average if the trait is neutral  and the distribution of their ratio will be chi squared  In the last decade  there has been a resurgence of statistical methods development work focused on expanding the general Q st F st framework to use more of the available data  either incorporating information about the genetic covariances among multiple traits which one may wish to examine concurrently  or about patterns of population structure which are not adequately captured by the univariate measure F st  Building on this work  we show that the Q st F st comparison can be see as a special case of a very general multivariate hypothesis testing framework  Using theory and simulations  we show how this generalized Q st F st framework admits wide flexibility for investigators to chose specific hypotheses about the data they wish to test  providing increased statistical power and resolution to identify traits or populations which may be of further interest  
Major Histocompatibility Complex diversity helps lemurs live longer and survive natural disasters  At the interface between genetic make up and survival  genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex  MHC  are partially responsible for initiating the body s immune response to pathogens  Therefore  an individual that is genetically diverse at its MHC genes is hypothesized to be capable of mounting an immune defense against a greater variety of infections than is an individual that has little MHC diversity   Because of the direct link between MHC and health  MHC diversity is thought to play a role in differential survival between individuals   We investigated the influence of MHC diversity on ring tailed lemur  Lemur catta  survival in both a captive  Duke Lemur Center  NC  n 105  and wild  Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve  Madagascar  n 151  population   All of the lemurs were genotyped at the second exon of the MHC DRB gene  using parallel tagged sequencing on 454 Titanium and Ion Torrent PGM platforms   Survival data came either from Duke s long term life history records or Beza s census data  which has been collected monthly since 2003   Under the relatively stable environmental conditions in captivity  ring tailed lemurs suffer from inbreeding depression  as individuals with fewer MHC alleles are more likely to die at younger ages  X2 4  p 
Smells like fish species  massively parallel sequencing supports sympatric speciation of coral reef fishes  genus  Haemulon   Despite advances in evolutionary biology over the past century  speciation remains one of the most controversial topics in the field  This is especially true for marine systems  where there are few obvious physical barriers to gene flow and most marine organisms have a pelagic larval stage with tremendous potential for dispersal  greatly reducing opportunities for isolation  In spite of these apparent obstacles  coral reefs harbor levels of diversity only comparable to tropical rainforests  Recent studies have reinvigorated interest in sympatric speciation  by providing models of how speciation can occur in the presence of gene flow  In this study we focus on two species of the genus Haemulon  H  flaviguttatum and H  maculicauda  with completely overlapping distributions throughout shallow reefs of the Tropical Eastern Pacific  Estimates of time to most recent common ancestor in these species show discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers  0 2Mya mtDNA  6 5Mya nDNA   a signal that is consistent with a scenario of recent introgressive hybridization  To explore this further  we sequenced more than 2000 loci with SNPs via double digested RADSeq  Analyses of these loci revealed introgression of a small fraction of the nuclear genome  reinforcing the case for recent hybridization  We detected signals of disruptive selection at several loci  indicating that selection may be driving divergence in this pair of sister species  Taken together our results suggest a case of ecological speciation in the presence of gene flow  Similar analyses for allopatric populations of H  steindachneri  separated by the Isthmus of Panama for 3Mya  revealed no evidence of introgression and no signals of selection  This study between closely related lineages of the genus Haemulon reveals contrasting patterns of divergence between lineages diverging due to geographic isolation and genetic drift  populations of H  stenidachneri   versus lineages diverging under the influence of selection in the face of gene flow  H  flaviguttatum and H  maculicauda   
Genetic basis of life history plasticity in D  melanogaster  Identifying genes and gene networks that are involved in the ability to respond plastically to environmental stimulus is an emerging field in ecological genetics  We have demonstrated that natural populations of D  melanogaster are plastic for development time and that there is variation in the strength of the response between different populations  However  the genes that underlie these responses are unknown  Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel  DGRP  we were able to get biologically replicated data for the response of four phenotypes  development time  mass  lipid content and pupation height  to two environmental parameters  day length and food type   Plasticity was measured using Hedge s g to calculate the magnitude and direction of change resulting from the different environments  The modularity of the plastic response was addressed by using phenotypic correlation to test the independence of the strength of response across all four traits  To identify the genetic basis of plasticity we used two approaches a GWAS and GSEA  For one gene  couch potato  we present data that confirms the gene has pleotropic effects on the ability to produce a plastic response across multiple phenotypes   
ROLE OF THE WNT PATHWAY IN LIFE CYCLE EVOLUTION IN THE HYDRACTINIIDAE  CNIDARIA  HYDROZOA   Many members of the cnidarian group Hydrozoa display a complex life cycle  alternating between a benthic asexual hydroid stage and a sexual pelagic medusa stage   However  most hydrozoans lack a free swimming medusa and instead reach sexual maturity with a gonophore that remains attached to the polyp   These sexually mature  yet under developed gonophores have been traditionally split into two morphologically distinct categories that mirror different stages of arrested medusae development   1  sporosacs are sexually mature gonophores that lack any trace of medusae characters  and   2  medusoids are gonophores that possess some medusae like characters  but unlike medusae  medusoids cannot feed and often remain attached to the polyp  Previous phylogenetic studies have recovered the free living medusa as ancestral for Hydrozoa  with medusae reduction to medusoids and sporosacs occurring multiple times in hydrozoan evolution  Wnt pathway genes appear to play an important role in axial patterning in hydrozoans and we hypothesize that these genes may be involved in the evolution of medusae reduction  Here we report the comparative gene expression of Wnt pathway components in hydractiniid medusae and sporosac bearing representatives  Podocoryna carnea and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus  respectively   These data suggest that simple changes in the regulation of the Wnt pathway may be involved in the loss of a free swimming medusa in hydrozoan life cycle evolution   
Combined morphological and multigene analysis allows comprehensive taxon sampling of the subfamily of pitvipers  Serpentes  Crotalinae   Pitvipers are a useful model organism for many evolutionary questions  including biogeography and comparative biology  The group can be of even better use with a phylogeny including a maximal number of species  Although several studies have thoroughly sampled species relationships of genera or related groups of genera  the most comprehensive study to date included 126 of 224 currently described species  Pitvipers share a challenge with a number of other vertebrate groups in that specimens are commonly preserved with formaldehyde  making tissues unavailable for DNA analysis but preserving thousands of specimens for morphological examination  This study combines morphological data for over 90  of species with multigene mitochondrial data for over 75  and a nuclear locus for over 40   It is the first study to include morphology in a large scale phylogenetic context for Asian pitvipers  We evaluate the placement of limited data morphology only taxa  approximately 98  incomplete in a matrix of over 4500 characters  and the effect of combining these independent datasets  We investigate pitviper intergeneric relationships  which have been historically difficult to resolve due to short internal branches  We discuss species  and genus level relationships which have not been reported or have been controversial in prior work  
Danio Genus Phylogeny Resolved with RAD Phylogenomics  Recent phylogenetic studies of the Danio genus  Cypriniformes  Cyprinidae  have inferred conflicting phylogenies with low support for several important relationships including the closest extant relative s  of the zebrafish Danio rerio  To bring consensus to the relationships within Danio  we performed phylogenomic analyses using Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing  RAD Seq   Our 2 7 megabase dataset incorporates sequences from twelve Danio species at more than 30 000 orthologous RAD Seq loci mapped to the zebrafish genome  Our analysis of the concatenated nucleotide sequences from these loci recovers a topology with all internal nodes unambiguously supported and provides strong evidence for Danio aesculapii as the closest extant relative of Danio rerio  This topology is consistent across analytical methods of genome assisted and genome independent datasets  Summary statistics of character state patterns and phylogenies inferred for individual RAD Seq loci  however  are inconsistent with a single underlying topology and reveal that the diversification of the Danio genus involved appreciable levels of gene flow during speciation and or introgression between species  In addition to inferring a well supported topology for Danio  we characterized the degree of RAD Seq locus conservation according to their mapping locations in the zebrafish genome  Results demonstrated that these loci are concentrated near exons and can be retained across several million years of evolution  suggesting that this phylogenomic approach is scalable to investigation of broad taxonomic groups even in the absence of a reference genome  Our genome informed analysis of RAD Seq loci also showed that the highly repetitive nature of the zebrafish genome is partially due to a recent expansion of some families of transposable elements during the diversification of Danio  To verify the results of this RAD Seq approach and begin comparative protein analyses across the genus  we are analyzing sequences from protein coding regions of zebrafish and some of its closest relatives  Together  our results provide a high resolution profile of the genome wide diversification of the Danio genus and provide further tools for the understanding of zebrafish in an evolutionary context  
Genetic architecture of skeletal evolution in unusually large house mice from Gough Island  The skeleton provides a scaffold for both form and function  and its evolution has played a crucial role in shaping the vertebrate body plan  In mammals  much has been learned about the genetics of skeletal variation from laboratory mice  but the genetic basis of skeletal evolution in natural populations remains poorly understood  Gough Island  GI  mice are the largest wild house mice  Mus musculus domesticus  in the world  with body masses twice those of their mainland relatives  We used X ray images to identify 16 skeletal dimensions that are enlarged in GI mice relative to a mainland reference strain  WSB   Historical records and population genetic results suggest that mice colonized Gough Island only 100 years ago  pointing to rapid skeletal evolution  To reveal the genetic basis of these skeletal changes  we measured the 16 skeletal traits in 840 F2 mice generated by an intercross between GI and WSB  Measurements were collected at three postnatal time points for each mouse to provide an ontogenetic perspective  F2s were genotyped at more than 3 000 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  across the mouse genome  Among the 16 measurements  14 were associated with multiple quantitative trait loci  QTL   Some of the QTL  including a large effect locus on chromosome 10  were also connected to body weight in the same cross  Other QTL were unique to particular bone measurements  These results indicate that the genetic mechanisms controlling the evolution of bone size act both globally and locally  and lay the foundation for genetic studies of adaptation to island life in mice  
Avian evolutionary history in the southern Neotropics  complex and varied patterns of diversification  Even though the study of the evolutionary history of the Neotropics has dramatically increased in the last few years  most work has been done in the Amazonian basin  the Atlantic forest and the northern part of the Andes mountains  By contrast  the southern cone of South America has barely been studied in this regard  This region is particularly interesting because of its high latitude  the occurrence of a diverse array of environments  including the highest peaks of the Andes mountains and the southernmost part of the Yungas and Atlantic Forest regions  and the presence of areas with some of the highest rates of avian diversification worldwide  We used citochrome c oxidase I  COI  sequences  DNA barcodes  from 3 425 specimens belonging to 730 species of Argentinean and Bolivian birds to analyze the patterns of diversification in this region and assess the role of various diversifying factors  Comparison with birds of the Nearctic and lower latitudes of the Neotropics evidenced that diversification patterns in southern South America are complex  consistent with the influence of glacial cycles as well as other factors more typical of the Neotropical realm  Comparisons among different areas of southern South America showed that species endemic to Patagonia and the Andes mountains are younger and less variable than more widely distributed species  and even more so than the northern  more tropical species  This pattern is consistent with a more prominent role of glacial cycles in the Andes and Patagonia and a more stable environment in the northern areas of this region  Finally  seven percent of the species showed high intraspecific variation  usually including deeply divergent lineages  The study of these cases with various algorithms permitted an initial assessment of the presence of evolutionary independent lineages  Further analyses including other molecular markers  morphology and vocalizations will indicate whether these taxa include overlooked species  allowing a better understanding of avian diversity in this region  
 Using fossils  ecology  and molecules to unravel the mechanisms shaping dry forest bird species diversity and distributions   The historical processes that drive endemism  speciation  and community composition are important in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the spatial structure of species diversity  Neotropical dry forests are characterized by low diversity yet high endemism  and we combined survey methods with fossil and molecular analysis to evaluate the relative importance of the Neogene Andean uplift and Quaternary climate change had on shaping the diversity and distributions of birds in dry forests over time  To evaluate the effects of these two abiotic processes we censused six modern bird communities in NW Peruvian dry forests that are separated by the Andes Mountains  the Mara on Valley and the Tumbesian region  In addition  we studied one late Pleistocene community in the Tumbesian region with fossil data  We used genetic analyses to date relative divergence times in subspecies found across the region  Fossils indicate more extensive dry forests and a non analog community at the Tumbesian site in the recent past  Therefore  historical climate change had a significant role in shaping distributions and community compositions  We predicted that the climatic instability through time in the Tumbesian region would result in more homogeneity in community composition across space as species track resources compared to the more stable Mara on Valley  To test this  we determined the betadiversity and phylobetadiversity across the bird communities with both presence absence and abundance data  Each species was assessed as being significantly over  or underrepresented across sites to investigate which species were driving these patterns  Bird communities subjected to more climatic instability during the Pleistocene  the Tumbesian region  tended to be more similar to each other than those of more climatically stable areas  Mara on Valley   Based on species abundance  a majority of the 217 species of birds recorded were overrepresented in two or fewer communities  This indicates that there is a propensity for species to become specialized to various patches of forest across NW Peru  Bird communities differed significantly between the Tumbesian region and the Mara on Valley  suggesting that geologic barriers have significantly structured communities at a regional scale both in terms of species and phylogenetic composition  To determine how long the Andes have been a barrier to the movement of species we determined relative divergence time in mitochondrial genes between subspecies unique to Tumbes and the Mara on Valley  Our results suggest that historical climate change  Andean barriers  and specialization to local conditions have led to the high endemism found in NW Peru  
Genomic Variations Associated with Gonococcal Antimicrobial Resistance  Multidrug antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has become a significant global public health concern   The recent development of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalasporins has fueled the need to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with the evolution of gonococal antimicrobial resistance   Studies have shown that the presence of the mosaic penA allele is associated with increased cephalosporin resistance   Moreover  evidence suggests that mutations in other genes  in combination with the mosaic penA allele  may also contribute to elevated resistance    To identify these accessory mutations  we compared whole genome sequences of a gonococcal strain containing the mosaic penA allele to derived laboratory selected mutants that exhibited significantly higher resistance     The comparison of mutants derived from the original strain allowed us to identify specific genomic variations on an isogenic background  which may contribute to higher levels of cephalosporin resistance in N  gonorrhoeae  
Analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA reveals cryptic speciation in North American flying squirrels  Glaucomys   Phylogeographic studies of North American boreal forest mammals have frequently demonstrated a marked mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA  discontinuity in the Pacific Northwest   This pattern apparently results from historic vicariant event s  that divided ancestral populations into coastal and interior lineages  followed by more recent secondary contact   We examined mtDNA variation in 205 northern flying squirrels  Glaucomys sabrinus  from across their range  with an emphasis on the Pacific Northwest  This analysis documented a strong phylogeographic break between a highly differentiated coastal clade and an interior clade  and also allowed us to identify several geographic locations where the two clades come into contact in the Pacific Northwest  To assess levels of nuclear gene flow between these two divergent lineages  we examined microsatellite variation at 8 loci in 64 individuals straddling the mtDNA phylogeographic break  This analysis revealed no evidence of recent or ongoing gene flow between the coastal and interior lineages of G  sabrinus  despite close proximity of samples from the two groups  A similar suite of microsatellite loci have previously demonstrated recent gene flow and apparent hybridization in northeastern North America between the same interior lineage of G  sabrinus and a sibling species  the southern flying squirrel  G  volans  Our new evidence strongly supports the existence of a cryptic species of flying squirrel in the Pacific Northwest  which would add a third species to the genus Glaucomys    
Parasite mediated sexual signaling  what do females gain   The Hamilton Zuk hypothesis proposes that host parasite co evolution maintains the honesty of sexual traits and predicts that attractive males with the greatest degree of sexual trait expression have lower parasite loads  Accordingly  this hypothesis also predicts that females use these signals as indicators of parasite resistance  Parasites are common in many species and represent a cost to their host as they can limit investment in reproduction and affect breeding success  Using parasite linked sexual traits in mate selection could confer benefits to females in at least three ways  attractive males could 1  have greater genetic resistance to parasites that can be passed to offspring   2  offer a better nest environment with lower parasite risk  and or 3  help to offset the costs of parasitism through behaviors such as provisioning    In a breeding population of North American barn swallows Hirundo rustica in Colorado  I applied a reciprocal cross fostering design where I experimentally manipulated parasites in nests to establish the degree to which females use male ventral coloration   a sexual signal in this population of barn swallows   for information about parasite resistant genotypes or parasite free environments  I also observed provisioning behavior of these birds to see if behavior changed with parasites and sexual trait expression   Because parasites differ across spatial scales  parasite mediated signaling may be based on different suites of parasites in different populations  This study will help me to tease apart the role of parasites in driving sexual selection and mate choice in North America before conducting larger comparative studies on barn swallow subspecies with divergent sexual selection on different plumage based traits  
Understanding variation in susceptibility and host response to the amphibian killing chytrid fungus  a case study in two bufonid species  In the wakes of Bd epidemic waves  researchers have observed that some host species suffer massive die offs and others persist  The mechanism s  that underlie the difference between winners and losers remains a mystery  Although environmental and ecological factors can affect susceptibility  previous work suggests that intrinsic differences in host response exist  The purpose of this study is to compare infection dynamics and host response in two related frog species under controlled laboratory conditions  I performed a Bd infection experiment in two toad species that were believed to differ in susceptibility  Bufo marinus  resistant  and Bufo boreas  susceptible   After experimental inoculation with Bd  we observed higher disease incidence and higher pathogen loads in B  boreas compared to B  marinus  Histological examination of epidermal sections from ventral integument revealed higher infection intensities as well as structural disruption in B  boreas  In addition  B  boreas experienced a loss in body weight as compared to control individuals  We analyzed transcriptomic changes in Bd exposed individuals compared to control individuals for both species  Overall B  boreas had a higher transcriptional response to infection than B  marinus  which may result from numerous and severe physiological disruptions associated with high pathogen load  In B  marinus  transcriptional patterns related to skin structure and water balance are host response pathways that may be critical for disease resistance  Together our results confirm that intrinsic host response differences are important for determining susceptibility  
Hybrid taxa mislead phylogeographic analyses in Tolpis  Asteraceae   Hybridization is an important evolutionary process that can significantly affect phylogenetic tree inference  as well as downstream analyses  such as character state or phylogeographic reconstructions  Here we present statistical metrics to measure departure from multi species coalescent models  and discuss how these metric can be used to identify instances of hybrid speciation  We illustrate this approach by applying our method to tree inference and ancestral area reconstruction of the island plant lineage Tolpis  Asteraceae   Tolpis comprises several species of potential hybrid origin and displays a complex biogeographic history  including dispersals among and between island and continental habitats  Our results demonstrate that failing to recognize hybrid taxa can mislead subsequent phylogeographic inference  and   more broadly   that the unadjusted inclusion of hybrid taxa can increase the uncertainty in evolutionary analyses  
Building developmental mechanisms into genotype phenotype predictions in changing environments  A fundamental challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic differences among individuals  Here  we present a detailed mechanistic genotype   phenotype model of the timing of flowering in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana  Our model draws on physiology  genetics and gene networks to explain how environmental conditions throughout the entire developmental history of an organism shape its relationship between genotype and phenotype  We show how gene x environment interactions and epistasis among alleles are emergent properties of the developmental model  Finally  we demonstrate the power of our model by predicting flowering time phenotypes of novel genotypes in a recombinant inbred line panel in seasonal environments and validating these predictions against field data  
 Hybrid Zones  Genomic Ancestry Patterns  and Genomic Scans for Hybrid Sterility Genes   Hybrid zones provide natural laboratories for understaning speciation  Hybrid zones form when two lineages resume contact after a significant period of isolation  If the two groups are on the path to speciation  hybrid offspring are likely to exhibit reduced fertility  Hybrid sterility often results from deleterious epistatic interactions  known as Dobzhansky Muller incompatibilities  DMIs  that accumulate between populations evolving in allopatry  If DMIs reduce fertility in naturally occurring hybrids to a degree that species differences can be maintained despite gene flow  they should affect patterns of genomic diversity in hybrid zones  In principle  genomic scans of gene flow in hybrid zones can be used to identify hybrid incompatibilities  Existing analytical approaches focused on clines are not specifically designed to detect epistatic selection and do not easily scale to the entire genome  Here we focus on an alternative measure of gene flow that overcomes these challenges  When hybrids form  recombination produces haplotypes that are mosaics of ancestry  The points where ancestry switches   ancestry junctions   are direct products of recombination in hybrids and are influenced by demographic as well as selective processes  We conducted individual based simulations to understand how genomic ancestry blocks are affected by population structure and selection against DMIs  First  we show how migration and drift affect the density of junctions across the genome in admixed Wright Fisher populations and in a stepping stone model of a hybrid zone  Then  we demonstrate that the presence of a two locus DMI reduces the junction density at one or both loci  Our findings reveal the potential of using ancestry junctions to better understand the demographic history of hybrid zones and to detect DMI loci in genomic scans conducted in hybrid zones  
Evidence for early adaptive divergence in Malagasy primates  niche filling and mass extinction  Ecological divergence in adaptive radiations may be the primary mode of speciation generating biodiversity  Rapid speciation and trait diversification due to selection and niche divergence characterize adaptive radiations  The primates of Madagascar  lemurs  are monophyletic  speciose  and ecologically diverse  suggesting they may have diversified in an adaptive radiation  If lemurs diversified in an adaptive radiation  then phenotypic traits  especially body mass  are predicted to have diverged adaptively early in lemur evolution  I used a total evidence tip dating approach to infer the first near complete phylogeny of extant and extinct lemurs as well as living and fossil relatives  115 taxa   I compared models of body mass evolution under gradual  rapid  and adaptive evolution and estimated the magnitude and tempo of body mass change through time  The divergence time estimates for the initial splits of main clades are older than previous studies that used molecular data and node calibration by up to 20 million years  Models of body mass evolution suggest that divergences towards large  and small bodied optima occurred rapidly within clades  This pattern is apparent across multiple lineages  consistent with a model of character displacement during early radiation  These results suggest that lemur phenotypes diverged early in their evolution  as predicted if early lineages filled unique niches to avoid competition  Crucially  the extinction of giant lemurs has changed the evolutionary and phenotypic structure of lemur diversity substantially  and including the extinct forms is necessary for understanding the patterns of lemur evolution  
aTRAM   automated Target Restricted Assembly Method   A fast method for assembling genes from massively parallel sequence data  New sequencing technologies have rapidly increased the amount of genetic data obtained in a single run  These datasets present a large computational challenge for biologists  and software is needed to reduce computational time to sort through and obtain necessary genes  Here we describe software that will rapidly assemble individual genes from massively paralleled sequencing without a complete genome assembly  aTRAM  automated Target Restricted Assembly Method  aTRAM uses a query sequence and BLAST to target matching short genomic reads  identifies their paired ends  and assembles them using a de novo assembler  These contigs are then used as the query in an iterative procedure to recover the full locus  An example 36 GB dataset was run through aTRAM and queried for 1 534 genes  taking on average 55 seconds per gene  Our results indicate that genes assembled by aTRAM were as  or more  complete than those assembled from a reference based or de novo assembly  These results suggest that this software can reduce the computational time necessary to assemble gene space data from short read sequencing methods  
Structured Populations with Limited Resources Exhibit Higher Rates of Complex Function Evolution  The impact of population structure on evolving populations is difficult to study  Populations broken up into groups of organisms and connected by low levels of migration will experience different types of geneflow than normal unstructured populations  Various studies  spanning decades of research  have lead to seemingly contradictory conclusions  Some point to population structure as a means to improve adaptation  others argue that population structure hinders evolution  We investigate how population structure impacts the evolution of complex functions in environments with limited resources  We find that structured populations with limited resources tend to evolve complex functions at a higher rate than unstructured populations  across a broad range of migration rates  This suggests that population structure may have an important impact on evolution  in both sexual and asexual populations  at least at certain migration rates  Keywords  Experimenatl Evolution  Structured Populations  Diversity  Limited Resources 
 Body size  Range size  and Biogeography in North American Minnows   Body size is one of the most important traits influencing an organism s ecology and is often a major axis of evolutionary change  Among freshwater fishes  body size may influence patterns of biogeography and macroevolution  Fishes with larger bodies are better dispersers  inhabit larger streams and rivers  and may have larger ranges  Conversely  smaller fishes can inhabit smaller streams  are generally poorer dispersers  and are thus more likely to become isolated among drainages  We tested for a relationship between body size and range size in the highly speciose endemic clade of North American minnows  Cyprinidae   which exhibit diverse body sizes and ecologies  We developed a novel species level phylogeny based on 7 mitochondrial genes and 10 nuclear genes  We used this phylogeny to reconstruct ancestral body sizes  range sizes  and geographical range  We also examined regional trends in trait disparification  and body size at reconstructed dispersal and vicariance events  Lastly  after accounting for phylogenetic relatedness and uncertainty  we tested whether range size is related to body size  We discuss our results in the context of environmental stability  dispersal ability  and species diversity  
Testing Darwin s hypothesis on the evolution of ornamental eyespots in peafowl and their relatives  The most striking feature of peafowl  Pavo  is the males  elaborate train  which exhibits ocelli  ornamental eyespots  that are under sexual selection  Two additional genera within the Phasianidae  Polyplectron and Argusianus  exhibit ocelli  but the appearance and location of these ornamental eyespots exhibits substantial variation among these genera  raising the question of whether ocelli are homologous  Within Polyplectron  ocelli are ancestral  suggesting ocelli may have evolved even earlier  prior to the divergence among genera  However  it remains unclear whether Pavo  Polyplectron  and Argusianus form a monophyletic clade in which ocelli evolved once  We estimated the phylogeny of the ocellated species using sequences from 1966 ultraconserved elements  UCEs  and three mitochondrial regions  The three ocellated genera did form a strongly supported clade  but each ocellated genus was sister to at least one genus without ocelli  Indeed  Polyplectron and Galloperdix  a genus not previously suggested to be related to any ocellated taxon  were sister genera  The close relationship between taxa with and without ocelli suggests multiple gains or losses  Independent gains  possibly reflecting a pre existing bias for eye like structures among females and or the existence of a simple mutational pathway for the origin of ocelli  appears to be the most likely explanation  
Determining asexual versus sexual propagation in the octocoral Paramuricea using RAD sequencing  Deep sea habitats are highly diverse communities  with underwater canyons often acting as biodiversity hotspots  However  because corals are slow growing and long lived traditional markers are not very useful for delineating populations or examining parentage  Paramuricea is a common deep sea coral found at depths >200 meters   Corals  including Paramuricea  are often found in groups located close together because suitable substrates are limited in the deep sea  It is unknown if these groups are the result of asexual or sexual recruitment  We employed restriction site associated DNA sequencing  RAD seq  to identify SNPs in natural populations of the octocoral Paramuricea  Our goals were then to examine genetic diversity in populations of the North Atlantic and along the Florida shelf  As well as identify clonal individuals and examine their distribution  
Ecological stoichiometry in a Daphnia algae system in the age of  omics  Predictions of ecological stoichiometry have largely been tested and refined using data on a few abundant elements  e g   carbon  nitrogen  phosphorus   Though relatively less abundant  other elements  e g   trace  also play critical physiological and ecological roles  while obeying stoichiometric principles  In this study  we compare the somatic concentrations of the entire suite of elements in algae as well as in four genotypes of Daphnia grown under two distinct conditions of phosphorus supply  Our results suggest that altering P supply alone invokes widespread changes in somatic elemental profiles in both algae and Daphnia  We found algae were more homeostatic compared to Daphnia in some elements  Daphnia exhibited higher homeostasis in macroelements compared to micronutrients  Furthermore  interactions among individual elements are strongly influenced by P supply  Information on multiple elements in addition to C  N and P should aid in more sophisticated stoichiometric models   
Assembling genes without genomes  phylogenomic exploration within the family Salicaceae  For many comparative questions of gene evolution  sequencing millions of short reads has become much faster and easier  while at the same time  full genome assembly of multiple target species is still time consuming and not necessarily feasible on many taxa  However  depending on the question  targeted assembly of paralogs or putative homologs across phylogenetic space may be sufficient to address these questions  aTRAM  or automated Target Restricted Assembly Method  is a new tool that can direct de novo assembly at only genes or regions of interest  This method can be used to efficiently assemble only the regions needed to address specific evolutionary questions  without additional library preparation or sample enrichment before sequencing  We report progress on a Salix eriocephala gene space assembly generated via aTRAM using the Populus trichocarpa reference genome  We also report progress on multilocus phylogenies across the Salicaceae  using loci generated by aTRAM  These results suggest that aTRAM can be used to address questions both broadly across phylogenetic space as well as deeply within genomic space 
The role of MEE57 and global 5mC methylation on natural variation in flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana  Heritable phenotypic variation may be influenced by epigenetic changes  adding another layer of complexity to evolutionary processes  But specific examples linking genetic variation  epigenetic variation  and phenotypic variation are rare  Genome wide methylation of DNA strongly influences flowering phenology in Arabidopsis thaliana laboratory strains  and natural A  thaliana strains vary in their genome wide methylation levels  Genes of the METHYLTRANSFERASE gene family are important regulators of genomewide DNA methylation patterns in A  thaliana  We found that one of these genes  MATERNAL EFFECT EMBRYO ARREST 57  MEE57  harbors high frequency  naturally segregating  non synonymous alleles that are associated with variation in flowering phenologies among wild strains  This suggests that MEE57 provides a mechanism by which genomewide methylation patterns vary among naturally occurring individuals of A  thaliana  thereby influencing flowering time in the wild  
Taking many to one to the next level  decoupled evolution in an ultrafast prey capture mechanism  Biomechanical systems are inherently multi part  multi level and interconnecting  Evolution may operate at individual levels independently  on the entire apparatus as a whole or both simultaneously  We examined the interconnecting lever and linkage mechanisms found in the fast raptorial appendages of mantis shrimp  Stomatopoda  both at the level of the individual mechanisms and the apparatus as a whole  The many to one mapping of biological mechanisms is a common framework for understanding evolution within mechanical systems such as 4 bar linkages  yet it is not clear whether an analogous process should occur for interconnecting mechanical systems  We tested the hypothesis that the individual mechanisms  levers and linkages  show the same basic pattern of evolution as the overall multi part system  We measured a series of biomechanical metrics  e g   kinematic transmission  and utilized landmark based geometric morphometrics to characterize the mechanics and morphology of the raptorial appendage system  We used phylogenetic comparative methods to test the prediction that if the overall system is canalized towards a limited number of biomechanical profiles  as previously shown  then the individual mechanisms will likewise show constrained variation in morphology and mechanics  Contrary to this prediction  we find that different levels of the biomechanical system show differing evolutionary patterns of variability  The overall raptorial appendage shows strong canalization towards one of two biomechanical profiles  either force amplification or displacement amplification  However  the linkage mechanism underlying this system shows a greater variability of forms as expected from many to one mapping theory  These findings suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of coupled mechanical systems need not be coupled themselves  Multi level systems can follow different evolutionary pathways depending on the level being examined  
The genetic architecture of local adaptation at fine spatial scales   a case study of three montane conifer species  The structuring of genetic diversity within natural populations of forest trees results from the interplay of numerous evolutionary forces  such as genetic drift  migration  and natural selection  Landscape genomics is concerned with testing hypotheses about how these interacting evolutionary forces change over geographical space to shape naturally occurring patterns of this diversity  Here  a landscape genomic approach will be used to illustrate how genetic drift  migration  and natural selection interact to determine patterns of genetic diversity  including the genetic diversity underlying fitness related phenotypes  at fine spatial scales within natural populations of forest trees  This task will be accomplished by providing evidence that populations of sugar pine  P  lambertiana Douglas   western white pine  P  monticola Douglas ex  Don   and whitebark pine  P  albicaulis Engelm   are adapted to local site conditions within the Lake Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada  More specifically  I will test the hypothesis that local adaptation is apparent at local spatial scales  i e    600 km2   despite large amounts of pollen mediated gene flow among local populations  I will also highlight  however  several instances where clearly adaptive patterns of genetic diversity have been influenced by local demographic events  Building upon these results  I will then illustrate how the observed patterns of molecular genetic diversity for a varied set of functional genes are organized relative to the phenotypic variation used to highlight local adaptation  The drivers of these patterns are likely the multilocus aspects of molecular genetic diversity as it contributes to local adaptation at fine spatial scales  Lastly  I will draw upon an emerging example from foxtail pine  P  balfouriana Grev    Balf   to illustrate the promising role that species of Pinus subgenus Strobus can play in our understanding of the genetic architecture of local adaptation and the ability of this architecture to rapidly respond to environmental change within natural populations of forest trees  
Zoogeography of genus Salvelinus in Kamchatka Peninsula  Dolly Varden Charr is known to have a continuous distribution range from Beringia to the Amur mouth  At the same time  distribution area of Arctic Charr is divided by Kamchatka peninsula  Ways of Kamchatka lake colonization are obviously associated with invasion of the anadromous form of charrs to the South of the peninsula by the end of Pleistocene last glacial period  We assumed that Arctic Charr could colonize Kamchatka peninsula by two possible ways  from the Arctic Ocean through Beringia and from the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea  Charrs were able to reach the Okhotsk Sea from the Arctic basin by the temporary water path  which was formed during glacier melting in the Kolima and the Indigirka River headwaters  Six postglacial Kamchatka lakes were selected for the study of charrs fauna  These lakes are located along the both sides of Kamchatka peninsula ridge at the length of 720 km  Recently the Arctic morphotype local populations were described in the two neighbor lakes at the southern part of Kamchatka and fauna of the other four lakes was not previously studied  D loop and Cytochrome B region sequences of the charrs were analyzed to clarify their taxonomic positions  Lacustrine charrs were found to be divided into 2 groups using morphometric and meristic characters in all the lakes  The first group individuals were associated with Arctic charr and had a greater number of gill rakers and pyloric caeca  as well as increased antedorsal and anteventral distances  The second group was associated with common Kamchatka Dolly Varden  Salvelinus species were probably isolated during all the period of sympatric habitation in these lakes  MtDNA analysis showed that the fishes inhabiting the Dal nee Lake  the Nachikinskoe Lake  the Dvuchjurtochnoe Lake  and the Ayaogitgyn Lake are phylogenetically close to Arctic charr from Chukotka and Alaska or to common Dolly Varden  Also we revealed the mtDNA introgression between Dolly Varden and Arctic charr in the Sokoch Lake and the Kopil ye Lake  Findings of Arctic Charr in the south of the peninsula and the complete lack of intermediate population at the both coasts of Kamchatka is a mysterious zoogeographical incident  which confirms that this area of mountain lakes in Kamchatka is yet underexplored  
Detecting concerted demographic history using hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation  Methods that integrate population level sampling from multiple taxa into a single community level analysis are an essential addition to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit  Here we present a statistical framework for such an analysis based on hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation  hABC  with the goal of detecting concerted demographic histories across an ecological assemblage  Detecting how species within communities have demographically tracked each other in space and time is important with regards to understanding the effects of future climate and landscape changes and the resulting acceleration of extinctions  biological invasions and potential surges in adaptive evolution  Furthermore  whether species responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of related questions about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly  Our method combines population genetic datasets from multiple taxa into a single analysis to estimate  1  the proportion of a community sample that demographically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse  and 2  when the pulse occurred  The method is appropriate for population level DNA barcode data broadly sampled across a wide breadth of taxa and can accommodate dataset heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size  mutation rates  and sample sizes across species and exploits the statistical strength from the simultaneous analysis of multiple species  This hABC framework used in a multi taxa demographic context can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change by determining what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently  and can be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic datasets as biota wide DNA barcoding data sets accumulate 
Caught in the Crossfire  Genes tangled up in host mediated transposable element defense  Host genome defense against transposable elements  TEs  is complicated by off target silencing effects  TEs that are epigenetically silenced by Piwi interacting RNA  piRNA  can spread their silencing state to nearby genes as well as nucleate flanking non TE sequences as new sources of piRNA  Host control of TEs can thus come at the cost of compromising local gene expression  Previous studies have found that maternal provisioning of piRNAs that target TEs is critical for maintaining TE repression across generations  In light of these studies  we are investigating the influence of maternal genic piRNA inheritance on patterns of gene expression in offspring  Results from the analysis of strains that contribute to a hybrid dysgenic syndrome in Drosophila virilis reveal differences in genic piRNA targeting  which allows for the analysis of how transgenerational genic piRNA pools influence gene expression in progeny  We find that differentially expressed genic piRNAs have variable effects on gene expression in future generations  In addition  the loci which are the targets of piRNA silencing in parents vary in the degree to which they produce piRNA in the next generation  Finally  global TE derepression seems to affect abundance of genic off target effects  Thus  these small RNAs involved in germline TE defense can potentially influence gene expression variation in natural populations   
A gradual scenario for the evolution of a complex behavioral trait  migration in Tyrant Flycatchers  Migratory behavior is thought to evolve in response to ecological pressures  allowing animals to benefit from resource abundance in different geographic regions  Migration has convergently evolved in many lineages of birds involving a variety of strategies  For instance  some lineages are partially migratory  meaning that some individuals migrate and others stay as permanent residents  Among partially migratory species  all individuals may reproduce in the same place or migrants may reproduce elsewhere  Although many lineages of birds have been characterized as partially migratory  little is known about the evolution of this migratory strategy  which has been hypothesized to be an intermediate step towards the evolution of strict migration  We adopted a multi scale approach to understand the evolution of partial migration under a phylogenetic framework  First  we tested discrete models of character evolution in the Tyrant Flycatchers  Aves  Tyrannidae  to determine the likelihood of partial migration representing an intermediate step in the evolution of strict migration  We also studied the relationship between the evolution of migratory behavior and phylogeographic and demographic history in the partially migratory Fork tailed Flycatcher  Tyrannus savana   Our results provide support for the model of gradual evolution of migration  i e  with partial migration being an intermediate step   In contrast to previous studies  we find that migration in flycatchers has evolved from resident ancestors and vice versa  Our microevolutionary analysis provides insights into the evolution of a complex behavioral trait that may potentially confer reproductive isolation between populations  This is a fundamental step towards understanding the role of behavioral shifts as drivers of diversification  
Towards inferring the history of life in the presence of lateral gene transfers  Lateral gene transfers have been found to affect all gene families  especially in unicellular organisms  Together with population level processes and events of gene duplications and losses they introduce conflict between gene phylogenies and species phylogeny  In addition  scarcity of information in gene sequences  along with model inadequacy  make confidently reconstructing accurate gene trees impossible  As a result  the species phylogeny becomes extremely difficult to identify with current reconstruction methods that assume that all sequences have evolved along the same tree  In this talk  I will present a new method developed in Lyon that relaxes the assumption that all sequences have evolved along a single tree  Instead  this method explicitly models events of gene transfer  duplication  and loss  and allows each gene family to follow its own unique evolutionary trajectory  Importantly  it does not assume that gene trees are known without error  but considers an entire tree distribution per gene family to account for all the phylogenetic uncertainty present in gene alignments  Computation of the likelihood is costly but can be achieved in parallel on clusters of computers  enabling us to conduct statistical inference for dozens of species at a time  We develop a new MCMC algorithm combining tempering and biased moves to infer a species phylogeny in which nodes are ordered  together with rates of gene transfer  duplication and loss  In addition we use gene family specific rates to identify gene families frequently or rarely transferred  much like the Gamma distribution is used to identify slow or fast evolving sites of a gene  We demonstrate our method on simulations as well as on the billion year old Cyanobacteria clade  and present our ongoing work addressing the history of life from whole genome data  
Environmental context matters  the impact of microbial symbiont on invasive insect host Megacopta cribraria is mediated by host plant  Host microbe interactions are ubiquitous and occur on a sliding scale from parasitic to mutualistic  The costs and benefits of maintaining symbioses can be altered by environmental and ecological context  The impact of contextual factors remains unknown for most symbioses  especially during range expansion or invasion  In such cases  microbes may enhance or constrain the use of novel resources by hosts  We sought to test the hypothesis that the impacts of a microbial symbiont on its host are contingent on the environmental and ecological context of plant diet  We examined sap feeding insect  Megacopta cribraria  which in 2009 invaded North America through Atlanta  Georgia  Since this time the range of M  cribraria has dramatically expanded throughout the southeastern United States  M  cribraria harbors an obligate bacterial symbiont in its gut that can be experimentally removed to assess the impact on host life history traits  In the native range  it has been shown that without these symbionts  insect host development is delayed  We assessed host life history traits  including development time  survival  and size  of these newly invaded M  cribraria under two potential host plants in field and laboratory experiments  We found life history trait differences in insects reared with and without microbial symbionts were mediated by the host plant context  Our results support the hypothesis that the host microbe interaction is environmentally contingent  These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the nature of symbiosis  
Modeling tumorigenesis in the intestinal crypt  The distribution of fitness effects in somatic tissue fundamentally alters tumor incidence curves   Tumors are the product of increased proliferative capacity in somatic cell lineages  This increase in cellular fitness is the result of the accumulation of mutations and genomic alterations in a selective context  The distribution of fitness effects  DFE  of new mutations has been characterized in several whole organisms  single celled and multicellular   although comparably little work has characterized the DFE in somatic tissue within multicellular organisms  The presence of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes  as well as other genes involved in regulating the cell division cycle  suggests that the DFE in somatic tissues may be fundamentally different from the DFE of whole organisms  which are selected to maximize reproductive rate  The goal of this work is to estimate the DFE in evolving pools of somatic stem cells and investigate the implications of alternative somatic DFE in tumorigenesis  We propose a novel model of stem cell regulated intestinal crypt dynamics using recent empirical findings of stem cell homeostasis and explore the evolution of fitness in the small pools of cells that continually divide and reconstitute the intestinal epithelium  As cells divide they have a chance to mutate and those mutations may affect the division and or differentiation rate of a stem cell lineage  Further  mutations become fixed via the action of drift and selection   Preliminary analysis suggests that characteristics of the DFE  as well as the specific cellular processes that the DFE influences  fundamentally affect the shape and magnitude of predicted tumor incidence curves  Understanding how new mutations govern cellular proliferation over time will shed light on the evolution that occurs in cell populations within organisms and how this evolution can lead to cancer and aging  
Fighting with ultrafast weapons  mantis shrimp win by striking more frequently  Animal weapons are often used in stereotyped fights that begin with the exchange of visual displays and then escalate to application of force  however  the use of ultrafast power amplified weapons may alter fight dynamics  Mantis shrimp  Stomatopoda  fight using weapons that exert repeated high force  transient strikes onto a competitor s impact resistant tail plate  telson   Here we test whether strike frequency or strike force predicts fight performance  We measured whether the winners and losers of Neogonodactylus bredini fights differed in the number of strikes they delivered during a fight and in the maximum force with which they struck a force sensor  We collected individuals from seagrass habitats in Panama and measured each individual s body size  body mass  weapon morphology  and maximum strike force  highest out of 10 strikes   We then paired body size  and sex matched individuals in fights over burrows  observing how frequently each individual struck its competitor during the fight and which competitor resided in the burrow at the end of the fight  Winners of fights did not produce greater maximum strike force than losers  however  winners struck more frequently during fights than losers  N  bredini fights almost immediately escalated to striking  this finding is in contrast to previous research showing that animals with weapons  including mantis shrimp  exchange weapon displays prior to escalated fighting   Thus  in size matched fights  individuals win not necessarily by having weapons that produce higher force  but instead win by using their weapons more frequently   The ultrafast power amplified weapons of mantis shrimp appear to shift fight dynamics from displays of size and applications of force to the repeated exertion of impact forces onto competitors   
Impact of ascertainment bias on phylogenetics of foodborne pathogen outbreaks  Whole genome phylogenetics is increasingly being utilized in the regulatory environment for identifying the contamination source of foodborne pathogens  However  these types of clonal outbreak phylogenies often have extremely recent divergence times  relying on only a few mutations for phylogenetic reconstruction  This makes them particularly vulnerable to sequencing errors or biases in single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  calls  In this study we use an empirical dataset of a recent Salmonella outbreak in concert with simulated data to compare SNP calling methods and their impact on accurately reconstructing the phylogeny of bacterial pathogen outbreaks  
 The Genome Sequence of a Widespread Apex Predator  the Golden Eagle  Aquila chrysaetos    Biologists routinely use molecular markers to identify conservation units  to quantify genetic connectivity  to estimate population sizes  and to identify targets of selection   Many imperiled eagle populations require such efforts and would benefit from enhanced genomic resources   We sequenced  assembled  and annotated the first eagle genome using DNA from a male golden eagle  Aquila chrysaetos  captured in western North America   We constructed genomic libraries that were sequenced using Illumina technology and assembled the high quality data to a depth of  40x coverage   The genome assembly includes 2 552 scaffolds >10 Kb and 415 scaffolds >1 2 Mb   We identified repetitive regions spanning 92 Mb   6  of the assembly   including LINES  SINES  LTR RTs and DNA transposons   We annotated 16 571 genes that are involved in myriad biological processes  including such disparate traits as beak formation and color vision   Such work can inform management decisions for species of conservation concern   For example  conservationists have suggested that coating wind turbines with ultraviolet reflective paint might prevent collisions between eagles and the man made structures   However  sequencing genes associated with vision provides evidence that golden eagles have violet tuned  rather than ultraviolet tuned  vision   We have additionally identified >3 000 orthologs in the golden eagle  two species of falcon and 5 other non raptor avian species   Identifying genes associated with vision  hearing  and olfaction that are under selection may provide insight to how raptors interact with their environment   Finally  the data reveal that several anonymous microsatellites commonly used for population studies are embedded within protein coding genes and thus may not have evolved in a neutral fashion   Because the genome sequence includes  800 000 novel polymorphisms  markers can now be chosen based on their proximity to functional genes involved in migration  carnivory  and other biological processes  
Resolving the complex evolutionary history of a Philippine songbird with genome wide markers  Inferring historical relationships between lineages of organisms can be a major challenge  especially when different data sources conflict  In the yellow bellied whistler  Pachycephala philippinensis   a polytypic bird species found in the Philippine archipelago  phylogenetic inference based on mitochondrial DNA resulted in puzzling relationships that contradicted subspecies boundaries  based on plumage variation  and prevailing biogeographic hypotheses  To infer population structure  topology  and population sizes in whistlers  we selected 40 individuals from 12 islands  including all ten mitochondrial clades and seven described subspecies  for genomic sequencing  We used a genotype by sequencing approach  which recovered 15 000 high coverage loci  Assessments of population structure suggest discordance between mitochondrial and genomic DNA  Individuals from central Mindanao Island share mtDNA with western Mindanao  but share their genomic DNA with Eastern Mindanao  The topology of the population genomic species tree is also discordant with the mitochondrial genealogy  The genomic species tree supports a colonization scenario shaped by Pleistocene aggregate island boundaries  whereas the mitochondrial tree supports a stepping stone colonization model  Estimates of effective population size are strongly correlated with island size  Distinctive populations inhabiting small  peripheral islands are recently derived from large island populations  suggesting rapid phenotypic change on small islands and stasis on large islands  
The genetics of adaptation to a granite outcrop environment in the Mimulus guttatus species complex  A primary goal in evolutionary biology is to understand what traits and genes underlie adaptation to different environments  This is difficult since many traits diverge simultaneously between populations and species  However  genetic manipulation in combination with fitness measurements in the field provides a powerful means to investigate a trait s individual adaptive significance  Despite their recent divergence  members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex have adapted to a wide range of ecological conditions  One species the complex  M  laciniatus  occurs in dry  exposed granite outcrops from mid to high elevation in the Sierra Nevada  CA  The ancestral M  guttatus grows alongside these rocky outcrops in moist streams and grassy seeps  M  laciniatus flowers earlier than sympatric M  guttatus  has a highly self fertilizing mating system  and a distinctive lobed leaf shape  These traits should be adaptive in dry environments  To investigate the genetic architecture and adaptive significance of flowering time  mating system  and leaf shape in M  laciniatus  granite outcrop habitat we mapped quantitative trait loci  QTL s  in the greenhouse  measured selection on F4 hybrids in a reciprocal transplant in the field  and tested whether our greenhouse QTL s contributed to F4 fitness in the field  We find that divergence in flowering time  mating system traits  and leaf shape between M  laciniatus and M  guttatus is due to few pleiotropic QTL s of large effect  that earlier flowering time is adaptive in M  laciniatus  granite outcrops  and that our major effect pleiotropic greenhouse QTL does not contribute to fitness in the field because the genetic architecture of our focal traits differs between greenhouse and field environments  
Horizontal gene transfer in the mitochondrial genome of Monsonia emarginata  Recent studies have shown that plant genomes have been involved in horizontal gene transfer  HGT   The mitochondrial genomes of plants have been especially subject to HGT when compared to the organellar and nuclear genomes of other eukaryotes  Phylogenetic analyses suggest HGT as the source for copies of many genes recovered from the assembly of the mitochondrial genome of Monsonia emarginata  a member of the angiosperm family Geraniaceae  These analyses suggest that potential donors are restricted to the angiosperms  Though the mitochondrial genomes of the Geraniaceae contain many examples of unusual molecular evolutionary phenomena  there is no evidence for such HGT in other members of this family  This may suggest the recent derivation of the propensity for HGT in this lineage  Some of the transferred copies are intact  which indicates functionality and or the recent occurrence of HGT  This work contributes to the growing body of evidence that HGT has had a significant impact on the evolution of genomes in eukaryotes  The current scope of the comparative genomics work in the mitochondrial genomes of the Geraniaceae will allow us to further investigate the evolutionary processes that underlie the occurrence of HGT in these mitochondrial genomes  
New assessment tools to capture student thinking about evolution and provide them with timely feedback  Teaching evolution to undergraduates comes with many challenges  one of which is uncovering student thinking that may be impeding their understanding of evolutionary concepts  A further challenge is providing them with feedback that will help them overcome these misconceptions  Multiple choice questions are limited in their ability to capture students  thinking  whereas short answer or essay questions   open response  questions  are difficult to implement in large classes in a way that allows instructors to provide specific and timely feedback  SimBio is developing assessment tools that will bridge this gap between multiple choice and open response questions  to use in computer based activities  such as our virtual labs and tutorials   We have developed two tools   LabLibs  and  WordBytes   that provide more structure and constraint than open response  but allow for more flexible and complex answers than multiple choice  In LabLibs  students complete answers by selecting from multiple drop down menus  in WordBytes  students construct answers from a pool of words and phrases  The more constrained nature of LabLibs makes it relatively straightforward to categorize all possible answers and write feedback for them  The greater freedom for constructing answers afforded by WordBytes makes scoring and feedback more complicated  but still less labor intensive than grading short answer questions   We tested these tools through student interviews in Spring 2013 to assess their ability to capture student thinking  and found good agreement between student responses in open response format and using the LabLibs and WordBytes tools  We then implemented LabLibs and WordBytes questions in two SimBio virtual labs on evolution   Darwinian Snails  and  Mendelian Pigs   in Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semesters  We have data from over 1 000 students at multiple schools each semester  To test the effectiveness of LabLibs and WordBytes in aiding student learning  we compared student answers before and after receiving feedback  Results suggest that the majority of students learn effectively from these tools  but they prove challenging for about 5 10  of students  Additionally  grading and feedback for LabLibs was accurate over 90  of the time  and could be specified by an instructor in about an hour   Unlike traditional computer grading of short answer questions  WordBytes grading could be specified without collecting a large number of student answers  though the accuracy improved when student answers were used to refine the grading rules   Taken together  we find WordBytes and LabLibs offer a reasonable tradeoff between student expression and ease of grading and feedback  
Theoretical model of long term asexual adaptation is consistent with systematic diminishing returns epistasis  Adaptation to a constant environment is characterized by an increase of a populations mean fitness over time  However  fitness dynamics over long timescales remain poorly understood  We report on development of a theoretical model of long term adaptation and its application to a 25 year experiment with E  coli spanning 50 000 generations  Using a theoretical framework based on clonal interference and a phenomenological description of pervasive diminishing returns epistasis  we find that long term asexual adaptation in a constant environment is consistent with a power law increase in mean fitness over time  This is in contrast to typical descriptions of fitness trajectories  which assume an asymptotic fitness value corresponding to a peak in the adaptive landscape  This theory makes quantitative predictions about properties of the system that have been measured independently  such as the strength of epistasis  accelerated adaptation of hypermutator phenotypes  time varying substitution rate  and between population variance in mean fitness  
National Experiment in Undergraduate Science Education  NEXUS    Teaching and Assessing a Competency Based Life Science Curriculum with Case Studies  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute  HHMI  funded National Experiment in Undergraduate Science Education  NEXUS  is a pedagogical experiment to create and evaluate new competency based teaching modules for undergraduate life science education  NEXUS is a collaborative effort among Purdue University  University of Maryland Baltimore County  University of Maryland College Park  and the University of Miami  UM  with each institution designing a unique part of this innovative curriculum  While encapsulating principles set forth in the BIO 2010  Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists  2003  and Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education  2011  reports  NEXUS was motivated by the Association of American Medical Colleges  AAMC  HHMI Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians  SFFP  report  2009  outlining eight science competencies that premedical students should master during their undergraduate career  which are applicable to all life science students  These competencies integrate biological concepts with principles of chemistry  mathematics  and physics  The NEXUS curriculum is designed for students to achieve mastery of these scientific competencies and gain an interdisciplinary perspective of biology  At UM we have developed case studies that present real world situations through narratives  As students read through the story  they answer associated questions in which they apply their scientific knowledge and integrative understanding of scientific concepts  We have developed a library of eight case studies which have been piloted in UM s Advanced Program for Integrated Science and Math  PRISM   PRISM is a science curriculum for undergraduates who are specifically interested in pursuing a research career  PRISM courses focus on integration of the sciences  All NEXUS case studies are tightly aligned to course objectives and SFFP competencies  We use student performance on case studies and their feedback on surveys to gauge student mastery of the competencies  Students are assessed pre  and post case study to evaluate their effectiveness  This presentation will focus on an evolution case study to demonstrate how they engage students and to highlight the results of our NEXUS evaluation  Data indicate that UM faculty and students are open to this new way of teaching  and even prefer teaching and learning with case studies  Students like the integration of the sciences and application to real life issues  They also appreciate the challenge of critical thinking  NEXUS case studies are helping students relate complex biological topics they learn in class to real world situations and are enabling them to make connections among their different science courses  
 Using networks of topologies and bipartitions to explore  quantify  and summarize phylogenetic tree space   Phylogenetic trees are now routinely inferred from enormous genome scale data sets  revealing extensive variation in phylogenetic signal both within and between individual genes  However  approaches that quantitatively characterize the full scope of phylogenetic information from such data sets do not yet exist  Richer  quantitative characterizations of tree set distributions are needed  Here  we propose a set of complementary approaches based primarily on network analyses to explore  quantify  and summarize the phylogenetic information in massive sets of trees  to clarify the extent of phylogenetic concordance and conflict across genomes  and to test hypotheses regarding the biological causes of variation in phylogenetic signal  We employ two distinct types of networks  The first type uses topologies as vertices and topological  dis similarity as edges  The second uses bipartitions as vertices and the degree of covariance in bipartition presence absence as edges  We discuss how such networks are constructed and highlight some of the ways that they can be employed to answer a variety of questions about both evolutionary pattern and process  
Approaches to reducing spurious signal in phylogenomic datasets  Topological heterogeneity among gene trees is widely observed in phylogenomic analyses and some of this variation is likely caused by systematic error in gene tree estimation   Systematic error can be mediated by improving models of sequence evolution to account for the complex evolutionary processes that shape genes across genomes and lineages   Alternatively  we can identify those genes whose evolution conforms to existing models and are thus most likely to produce reliable phylogenetic estimates  However  the best method for identifying such genes is not well established  Here  we ask if we can identify reliable gene tree estimates by filtering genes according to their clock likeness or posterior predictive effect size  an inference based measure of model violation   We compare these results to the commonly used approach of filtering based on overall rate   We assess the utility of these filtering approaches using two different metrics   First  we looked for greater than expected topological similarity among gene trees in filtered sets  Second  we compared gene tree topologies to accepted reference topologies  Our results suggest that filtering genes based on their clock likeness and posterior predictive effect size can yield a collection of genes with more reliable phylogenetic signal  
 Local adaptation to climate within a tree species range  the case of sugar pine  Pinus lambertiana    Divergent selection among populations experiencing heterogeneous environments is expected to generate patterns of local adaptation  However  population evolution will depend on several factors such as gene flow that can either counteract selection by homogenizing gene pools or enhance response to selection by favoring the exchange of pre adapted alleles  Assessing the extent of local adaptation is crucial in the current context of rapid climate change because locally adapted populations will be expected to lag behind their optimum  This is particularly true in long lived species such as forest trees  where evolution by natural selection will be slowed by a longer generation time relative to projected climate change  Provenance tests  in which individuals from multiple populations originating from different climates are grown in common experimental sites  can be used to dissect the role of climate in local adaptation  The studies of adaptation to climate usually rely on populations coming from latitudinal or elevation gradients  Our first expectation is that local adaptation would develop less easily in elevation gradients as gene flow is more likely between populations in contrasting environments  Yet  local adaptation can be observed in elevation gradients if selection is strong relatively to gene flow or if gene flow is prevented by phenological lags between populations  In general  latitudinal gradients should be better suited to highlight the broad imprint of climate on population adaptation  unless climate is not the main varying agent of selection  In our study  we are characterizing patterns of local adaptation in sugar pine  Pinus lambertiana   We are focusing on two sets of sugar pine provenance tests  Both tests include sources from a wide variety of latitudes and elevations across the entire species range  We will assess whether there is local adaptation to climate in Pinus lambertiana  We will test the hypothesis that genotypes originating in climates similar to each test garden site will perform better than genotypes from dissimilar climates  Moreover  we will test the hypothesis that gene flow affects local adaptation by testing the effect of geographic and climatic distance between sites of origin on growth differences in transplantations  assuming that gene flow decreases with increasing geographical distance  
The phylogeography of Peromyscus maniculatus across the northern California Channel Islands  The California Channel Islands  off the coast of Southern Caliornia  host a unique flora and fauna highlighted by a large number of noteworthy endemic species such as  now extinct  pygmy mammoths  the giant coreopsis and the island fox   Among resident species  the deer mouse  Peromyscus maniculatus  is the only mammal found on every island and each island has its own morphologically distinct subspecies  yet the pattern and timing of the colonization and diversification of deer mice across the Channel Islands remains poorly understood   To shed light on the phylogeography of P  maniculatus across the northern Channel Islands  we collected samples from all five of the islands in Channel Islands National Park along with two mainland sites and we sequenced a 394 base pair region of the mitochondrial control region as well as 5 microsatellite loci   Classical population genetics parameters  phylogenetic analyses  and a statistical parsimony haplotype network for the control region point to significant differentiation between island and mainland populations  Shared haplotypes between the islands and one but not the other of the two mainland sites suggest a potential origin for the island populations   The microsatellite loci revealed a great deal of genetic diversity  and Cluster and Migrate analyses suggest a complicated colonization history influenced by male biased dispersal between islands  
 Phylogeny  morphology and ontogeny of the Spikethumb Frogs  Hylidae  Plectrohyla    D A  S‡nchez  E N  Smith and J A  Campbell Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center  University of Texas at Arlington Middle American Tree Frogs  Hylidae  Hylinae  Hylini  diversified into more than 180 species in Tropical Central America and dispersed to South America  North America  Asia and Europe  They have an incredible diversity of shapes and sizes as adults  but more astonishing is that of their larvae  hardly comparable to any other anuran lineage  Hypotheses of evolutionary relationships of this group of frogs are available since 2005  with studies involving questions about ecology  speciation rate and evolution of morphological novelty  The largest genus in the tribe  Plectrohyla  with more than 40 species  currently includes species assigned to the genus before 2005  and frogs previously assigned to the Hyla bistincta group of Mexico  West of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec  A group of only a few species originally in Plectrohyla have been previously included in phylogenetic analyses  In this study  we reconstruct a phylogeny of the species in this genus using mitochondrial and nuclear markers  and with a thorough species sampling  We analyze some external adult and larval morphology  and together with geometric morphometry of available skulls we derive an evolutionary hypothesis of development  in ontogenetic and genealogical times  
Natural selection maintains high diversity in candidate genes underlying local adaptation to climate  evidence from whole transcriptome sequencing  Understanding the genetic basis of the local adaptation of populations to different environments is a major goal of evolutionary biology   Two ways to identify genetic loci important in local adaptation are 1  identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  that are extremely correlated with climate and 2  identifying genes that are differentially expressed by different populations under climate stress   We applied these approaches to populations of valley oak  Quercus lobata   an ecologically important California oak whose distribution has long been stable within a heterogeneous landscape  offering opportunity for local adaptation   To this end  we assembled a 73 Mb reference transcriptome composed of at least 12 000 complete transcripts and confidently called genotypes at over 200 000 SNPs for 22 valley oak individuals from throughout its natural distribution   Using a linear mixed modeling approach  EMMAX  that accounts for background population genetic structure  i e  kinship   we identified dozens of SNPs from dozens of genes that are extremely associated with climate variables   We then performed a greenhouse experiment exposing 12 seedlings from 4 climatically different sample sites to drought stress and measuring changes in gene expression before and after   We found thousands of differentially expressed genes   Genes with SNPs strongly associated with climate in natural populations were significantly overrepresented in the list of differentially expressed genes in the greenhouse experiment  providing strong evidence for their role in adaptation to local climate   These candidate genes had significantly higher nucleotide diversity and polymorphism rates than non candidate genes  suggesting that spatially environmentally varying natural selection maintains diversity in genes important in local adaptation to climate  
Non equilibrium dynamics lead to long term persistence of ancestral floral forms in modern angiosperms  Biological features that increase individual fitness  or that allow a species to diversify faster  are thought to increase in frequency due to selection until a new stable equilibrium is reached  Yet  many clades with plesiomorphic traits persist  and large clades with seemingly adaptive  derived traits do not dominate the tree of life  Here we develop a novel approach to address the concerted effects of microevolutionary innovation and differential net diversification on the evolutionary history of angiosperms  a clade known for its marked disparity in numbers of taxa per clade and representation of trait combinations across clades  Our analysis reveals that a synergy of three floral characters  corolla present  bilateral symmetry  reduced stamen number  acts a key innovation in angiosperms  leading to a two fold increase in diversification rates for lineages in which this combination evolves  The overall low rates at which these characters arise  however  has kept even lineages with the key three character combination in the minority  Stochastic simulations of angiosperm evolution suggest that angiosperms will remain far from the predicted equilibrium distribution of character states well into the future  Such non equilibrium dynamics may be common in clades where major innovations evolve relatively rarely  thus allowing lineages with ancestral forms to persist and even outnumber those with derived  adaptive states for tens of millions of years  
The effects of interspecific hybrid incompatibilities on gene flow during complex speciation  Genomic scans for interspecific introgression  e g   between house mouse subspecies  Drosophila species  Neanderthals and modern humans  have revealed apparent X versus autosome differences in the capacity for gene flow during complex speciation   We develop theory to evaluate the degree to which these chromosomal patterns can be attributed to hybrid incompatibilities   We model a neutral locus flanked by one or two genetically linked hybrid incompatibility loci and derive simple expressions for the probability of successful introgression of the neutral variant under a variety of genetic and selective scenarios  We find that dominance and the incompatibility strength are important determinants of the X autosome difference in introgression probabilities   Weakly selected incompatibilities can limit gene flow at closely linked sites but fail to yield pronounced X autosome differences in introgression   On the other hand  strongly selected and highly recessive incompatibilities   the kind typically studied in speciation genetic analyses   can easily produce the X autosome differences of the magnitude observed in genomic data  
Adaptation and the tempo of phenotypic change during radiation in the Hawaiian damselflies  Coenagrionidae  Megalagrion   The endemic Hawaiian damselflies  Coenagrionidae  Megalagrion spp   are a single radiation whose species have diversified over 11 my  in the process differentiating into a unusually broad array of larval habitats  from permanent streams to seeps and puddles  and even to damp terrestrial habitats   They are also extremely variable in adult coloration  including both female and sexual dimorphism   variation in color traits and dimorphisms are generally assumed to be due to sexual selection  though we propose that in this system they function as an adaptation   Here  we address the interaction between geographic isolation and adaptation to larval and adult habitats in the speciation process  including the development of mating barriers between species    First  we provide evidence from phylogenetic comparative analysis that adult color evolution can be rapid and is likely due to ecological selection  Aside from reflecting light to produce color  pigments can also act as protective antioxidants against the harmful effects of solar radiation   We show that variation in light habitats  as measured by canopy cover  significantly explains body color variation within sexes  female dimorphism   between sexes  sexual dimorphism   and among populations and species  Surprisingly  the degree of habitat difference between sexes also determines the degree of sexual dimorphism in body color  a trait usually attributed to sexual selection     Second  we evaluate how these strong adaptive pressures on larvae and adults have interacted with non adaptive mechanisms    geographic isolation and sexual selection  At the level of the entire Hawaiian radiation  we find strong differences in the tempo of morphological evolution of male clasper shape  a mate recognition character   compared to continental coenagrionid radiations driven primarily by non adaptive speciation   We also predicted that as species spread geographically  they should encounter both new larval and new adult light environments and rapidly differentiate in characters involved in adaptation and in neutral markers  if accompanied by evolution in mate recognition characters   Using microsatellite variation in one widely distributed and color variable species  M  calliphya  we find strong genetic differences associated with geographic isolation  especially between island complexes  in addition  clasper shape varies significantly between island complex populations  A synergistic effect of isolation and ecological selection on multiple traits across steep ecological gradients may explain the rapid tempo of change in morphology and color in this high island archipelago   
Determining the relationship between changes in interspecies recombination rates and nucleotide divergence  Identifying and understanding the genetic basis of speciation is a central question in evolutionary biology  Work on chromosomal inversions has shown that the reduced recombination in hybrids leads to higher levels of nucleotide divergence in these regions  Additionally  work on  islands of speciation  has found an accumulation of these  islands  in regions of low recombination  Despite the accepted importance of reduced recombination in contributing to persistence of hybridizing species  no major genetic variants  other than inversions  have been identified which act as interspecific recombination suppressors  Here  we present a statistic  which quantifies differences in hybrid recombination relative to intraspecific recombination in closely related species pairs  Using sister species  we test the relationship between this statistic and nucleotide divergence across various model systems  including Drosophila and yeast  For Drosophila pseudoobscura and D  persimilis we show a siginificant negative relationship  rho  0 5  p 0 02  N 32   owing to the presence of multiple chromosomal inversions  For the more divergent  S  cerevisiae and S  paradoxus we show no significant relationship  rho  0 11  p 0 13 N 181   More recent results are from more closely related taxa with no major chromosomal differences  By quantifying differences in divergence based on our statistic  our aim is to identify novel recombination suppressors and perhaps enhancers of hybrid recombination  Once genetic variants contributing to differences in both recombination and divergence in closely related species are identified using our approach  future research can study these genetic variants in non model systems to assess their broader importance in speciation  
Genetic effects and behavioral plasticity of winner and loser effects in baboons  Winner and loser effects commonly occur when individuals compete aggressively for access to limited resources such as food and mates  These effects are used to describe the phenomenon in which winners tend to become more likely to win in subsequent interactions  and losers tend to become more likely to lose  Winner and loser effects are predicted to evolve when individuals are uncertain about their relative fighting ability  in these situations  the outcome of a given agonistic interaction provides information on an individual s relative fighting ability  which can be used to adjust future agonistic behavior  However  current work on winner and loser effects ignores the fact that the relative fighting abilities of individuals change over time  e g  due to growth or aging  We hypothesize that temporal changes in relative fighting ability lead to the evolution of behavioral strategies that flexibly adjust the strength of winner and loser effects to expected age specific changes in fighting ability  To test this hypothesis we investigated agonistic behaviors in a population of wild baboons that consists primarily of yellow baboons  Papio cynocephalus  with some admixture from a closely related taxon  anubis baboons  P  anubis   We analyzed a total of 16 821 agonistic interactions among 152 adult males living in 5 social groups over a total time period of 54 group years  In agreement with our hypothesis  we found that winner effects were stronger than loser effects in young males  who undergo growth related increases in fighting ability  In contrast  winner effects were weaker than loser effects in old individuals  who undergo aging related decreases in fighting ability  In addition to testing for effects of age  we investigated whether winner and loser effects were related to admixture based genetic variation  Genetic hybrid scores were assigned to all individuals based on genotypes at 14 microsatellite loci  Our results show that increasing anubis admixture was associated with weaker winner and loser effects  Taken together our findings suggest a genetic basis for winner and loser effects in baboons and a flexible adjustment of these effects to temporal changes in relative fighting ability  More generally  our study points to the importance of temporal variation in individual fighting ability and social context as a driver for the evolution of agonistic behavior  
Engine for speciation  Experimental alteration of sexual conflict shows evidence of reproductive isolation in Drosophila Melanogaster   Inter sexual conflict  henceforth used interchangeably with sexual conflict  gives rise to rapid coevolution in traits related to reproduction in both sexes  Such high rates of evolution can potentially create divergence in genes responsible for these traits between populations with low or no gene flow  allopatric populations   Hence  it has been hypothesized that sexual conflict can act as a potential mediator for reproductive isolation in sexually reproducing allopatric populations  Although mathematical models and comparative phylogenetic studies support this idea  most experimental evolution studies have produced results that do not support this hypothesis  Here  we tested this hypothesis in a set of populations of Drosophila melanogaster that are subjected to different levels of intersexual conflict for nearly hundred generations  We show that allopatric populations having high level of sexual conflict indicate signs of incipient reproductive isolation  both behaviorally and in terms of competitive fitness  whereas allopatric populations with decreased level of conflict do not show any such signs  Matings between allopatric individuals from regime facing high levels of sexual conflict have lower copulation duration and sperm competitive ability compared to their sympatric counterparts but no such difference is present in the regime with lower level of sexual conflict  This is one of the rare experimental results to support the idea of  sexual conflict as an engine for speciation  
Gene Trees vs Species Trees  Piecing together the evolutionary history of the New Zealand cicada genus Kikihia  The genus Kikihia is endemic to New Zealand and contains 31 recognized species or subspecies  This genus is well distributed across the two islands of New Zealand and their low dispersal rates and rapid evolution makes Kikihia an ideal model for phylogenetic analysis  An intuitive tree  Dugdale and Fleming  unpublished data  complied from a combination of ecological  morphological and behavioral observations recognized four groups within the genus Kikihia     The analysis of mitochondrial DNA recognized five groups  the newest of which  Westlandica Group  was composed of cicadas from three of Dugdale and Fleming s groups  Marshal et al  2009   The goal of investigating nuclear genes is to determine if a nuclear gene phylogeny supports the Westlandica group as independent  or not and to provide greater resolution to the close relationships within and among groups  The Westlandica group  if not independent  may be the product of past hybridization events and mitochondrial capture  which would be an interesting life history event to observe  The nuclear genes EF1a  Calmodulin  Period and ARD1 were sequenced for 60 specimens of Kikihia  and used to create Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees to compare to the mitochondrial phylogeny  These individual gene trees were then combined into a species tree using STEM and  BEAST   
Understanding genome evolution in the dogwood genus Cornus L   Cornaceae  from analyses of transcriptome sequences  The pattern and rate of genome evolution is a central question in evolutionary biology  Genome and gene duplications are known to be major forces driving flowering plant evolution   However  in most non model plants  the dynamics of genome evolution and the pattern of large scale genome duplications  including polyploidization  still remain largely unknown  High through put transcriptome sequence data obtained using next generation sequencing technology have enabled novel investigation of genome evolution using new bioinformatics and methodological tools and phylogeny based comparative analyses among closely related species  Here we compare several de novo assembled transcriptomes representing four closely related dogwood species of the showy bracted clade of Cornus and the outgroup genus Alangium   Through gene annotation and molecular evolutionary analyses of gene sequences  we aim to address the following questions  1  Is there evidence of ancient polyploidy in any of these species  if so  when and where in the genus phylogeny did the genome duplication likely occur  2  Is there evidence of rate shifts in molecular evolution following genome duplication  as expected from differential fates of duplicated genes  e g   lost function  conserve the original function  or diverge and gain new function  3  Is there a genome wide acceleration of molecular evolution in the herbaceous lineage  as predicted by a possible shorter generation time and long branches in the molecular phylogeny of the genus  If so  what are the underlying evolutionary forces  4  What causal factors may explain the differences in the pattern and rate of genome wide molecular evolution among the dogwood species   Answering these questions will contribute to advancing our knowledge in genome evolution of non model organisms  
Is it time to abandon the holey fitness landscape metaphor   A holey fitness landscape consists of network of genotypes that has a fitness of one  and where all other genotypes have a fitness of zero  The metaphor of the holey fitness landscape has had success catching the imagination of many people  especially in the light of the success of Kimura s neutral theory of molecular evolution  Researchers and philosophers have embraced holey landscapes as an approximation for what is really going on with evolutionary dynamics and speciation  and have further suggested that it heralded the end of the adaptive landscape metaphor altogether  The basic premise of the holey landscape model is that when the dimensionality is very high a neutral network appears on which populations can traverse wide areas of genotype space  Genotypes that have fitness lower than this neutral network can be assigned a fitness of zero  and the claim is that this approximation does not change the dynamics of adaptive evolution and speciation  Here we will explain why we think this conclusion is unwarranted  First  the original mathematical argument rests upon an assumption about the structure of fitness landscapes that has later been shown to be inaccurate  Second  we present some simple models that demonstrate that evolutionary dynamics of evolving populations in holey landscapes and rugged landscapes with peaks separated by valleys of intermediate fitness do not resemble each other  The ease with which populations can cross even very deep valleys in the fitness landscape  and the frequency at which populations will take this path rather than relying on a sparse neutral network  renders the holey landscape approximation tenuous  We therefore suggest that rather than abandoning the metaphor of fitness landscapes and the intuitions they afford us about evolutionary dynamics  we should relinquish the holey fitness landscape model  
Using genome wide RAD markers to resolve character evolution and species history in Nymphalid butterflies  Restriction site associated DNA  RAD  methods can inexpensively generate large numbers of genome wide markers for essentially any species  For phylogenetic studies over divergent taxa  however  mutations in restriction sites over time can lead to significant data loss for deep nodes  Here  we use double digest RAD to generate both SNP and marker presence absence data for 57 species of mimetic Adelpha and Limenitis butterflies  The resulting phylogenies robustly indicate that at least two ancestors of the paraphyletic Adelpha independently colonized the Americas from Asia in the last 12 5 million years  In the subsequent species radiations  the convergent evolution of wing color pattern has also been widespread  We demonstrate that RAD markers are a flexible tool for studying character evolution and species relationships  particularly when missing data is a component of evolutionary inference    
Inferring differential introgression among Southern African White eyes  The Southern African White eyes  White eyes  Zosterops  have earned the moniker the  great speciators  by exhibiting the highest rate of diversification estimated among vertebrates  The rapid speciation among the birds of this group  and the extremely wide geographic distribution  Old World tropics  makes them an interesting group within which to examine speciation and hybrid zone dynamics  Previous work shows that the Southern African White eyes  Z  capensis  Z  pallidus  Z  senegalensis  and Z  virens  have diversified within the 100 thousand years  with the most recent species split occurring within the past 300 thousand years  Each species is distinguishable based on plumage and song and each is endemic to its own biome habitat type  Where the biomes meet hybrid zones form indicating a complex pattern of diversification seemingly related to environmental heterogeneity  However  differentiating between hybridization and introgression versus ancestral polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in this system is a challenge given its recent diversification  and to do so requires large numbers of independent markers  Using several thousand orthologous genome wide SNPs we first compare a new informatics pipeline with existing pipelines to evaluate how upstream informatics decisions affect downstream biological inference We then use these data to estimate a species tree  evaluate population structure and differentiation  assess introgression across lineages using statistical approaches  and look at associations between genetic and spatial structure  We recover strong signals of population differentiation accompanied by signals of introgression among lineages  however we find that informatics decisions made during the early stages of filtering  merging  alignment  and SNP calling of RAD data can have strong effects on downstream inference  such that different and often conflicting biological signals emerge  
Diversification of Malagasy ectotherms Part II  an exploration of patterns and processes  The tropical regions of the world house a disproportionately high amount of the world s biodiversity  Though the reasons for this are not well understood  a number of hypotheses have sought to explain these high rates of speciation  most focusing on the well studied biota of the Neotropics  The goal of this research project is to better understand biotic diversification in the tropics by focusing on Madagascar  a natural laboratory for such work  Due to its isolation it is well suited to exploring how organisms diverge  speciate  and persist in fragmented habitats without the confounding influence of migration to from adjacent areas  Ectotherms represent an ideal model with which to explore these hypotheses as the influence of abiotic changes  e g  glaciation associated cooling  ties them more directly to the causal factors invoked  Examination of genetic patterns across the Malagasy landscape reveal a highly complex system of unrecognized diversity  unexpected patterns and fine  geographic  scale diversification that greatly enhances our understanding of evolution here and elsewhere in the tropics  
Dobzhansky Muller incompatibilities and the evolution of reproductive isolation  One of the most alluring topics in evolution and ecology is the question of speciation  The Dobzhansky Muller  DM  model of genetic incompatibilities has been the major theoretical framework in our understanding of speciation  Although DM incompatibilities have been observed in nature  a detailed study of their general properties such as the average probability of incompatibility using a biological system is missing   In the DM model  an ancestral population splits into two populations that evolve independently with no gene flow between them  While evolving  new mutations arise and fix in both populations  Upon contact between these populations  mutations that arose in each population  while compatible with their own genetic background  can be incompatible with alleles in the other population  The negative epistasis between this alleles can lead to inviability sterility of the hybrids  Orr expanded this model to allow incompatibilities to include more than two loci    RNA molecules are perfect for studying the DM model because they have been extensively used to study epistatic interactions  Furthermore  they are crucial to many biological functions at the cellular level  e g  regulating gene expression  Considering their biological importance  DM incompatibilities in RNAs can contribute to reproductive isolation in nature   Our results  using diverging RNA complex in silico  have helped us to determine the average probability of DM incompatibilities and their average contribution to the overall reproductive isolation  
Evolution of wild yeasts as opportunistic pathogens during experimental co infection  Evolution of wild yeasts as opportunistic pathogens during experimental co infection Sujal Phadke  Serena Zhao  Calum Maclean  Timothy James Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology  University of Michigan  Ann Arbor  MI 48109 Opportunistic pathogens likely emerge from the native and environmentally acquired microbial flora when host immune response is weakened  We studied the propensity of wild isolates of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to become pathogenic upon continued association with a model host  wax moth larvae of Galleria mellonella  We serially passaged through the host a consortium of 60 wild strains isolated from various habitats  including clinical isolates  and used illumina barseq analysis to identify strains recovered after 30 days inside the host  This serial passaging strategy allowed us to compare the fitness of strains inside a novel host with that estimated from growth in standard in vitro conditions  We found two strains  a generalist and a specialist  to repeatedly outcompete others in vivo  increasing in relative frequency by  40   The generalist strain also outcompeted others by  30  increase in its relative frequency under in vitro conditions  Next  we tested pathogenic potential of the winner strains independently and in association with each other  Our results show that virulence is a dynamic trait and that the immediate biotic environment may be important early in the evolution of wild yeasts as opportunistic pathogens  Our results emphasize the need to study co infection dynamics in addition to virulence factors to aid understanding of evolution of infectious diseases  
The effects of inhibited recombination on the social chromosome of Solenopsis invicta  Genomic rearrangements can locally inhibit recombination  and therefore are thought to be required for the formation of genomic structures like sex chromosomes and supergenes  which act to maintain divergent phenotypes in a population  However  little is know about the early evolution of sex chromosomes and supergenes  and how it is affected by genomic rearrangements and local inhibition of recombination  The fire ant Solenopsis invicta  in which a pair of young social chromosomes controls two divergent forms of colony organization  offers a unique opportunity to understand the evolution of genomic rearrangements  The two social chromosome variants  SB and Sb  have structural differences leading to lack of recombination spanning approximately 55  of the chromosome  To test how inhibition of recombination affects sequence divergence between the two chromosome variants  we have identified SNPs in the genomes of haploid SB males and of haploid Sb males  We show that the two chromosome variants are highly divergent within the non recombining region  Within this region  the Sb variant has almost no diversity  while the SB variant has a level of diversity similar to the rest of the genome  This pattern is consistent with both neutral divergence  increased drift  and adaptive divergence between the two variants  selective sweeps   We use a population genetic approach to explicitly identify the balance between the two evolutionary forces  Furthermore  we report on heterogeneity of divergence along the non recombining region  identifying the sequence of rearrangement events that led to the current genomics structure  
Metrics for comparing the fit of time trees to the fossil record  Approaches quantifying the relative congruence  or incongruence  of molecular divergence estimates of clade age and the fossil record have been limited  Previously proposed methods are largely node specific  assessing incongruence at particular nodes for which both fossil data and molecular divergence estimates are available  These existing metrics  and other methods that quantify incongruence across topologies including entirely extinct clades  have so far not taken into account uncertainty surrounding both the divergence estimates and the ages of fossils  They have also treated molecular divergence estimates younger than previously assessed fossil minimum estimates of clade age as if they were the same as cases in which they were older  However  these cases are not the same  Recovered divergence dates younger than compared oldest known occurrences require prior hypotheses regarding the phylogenetic position of the compared fossil record and standard assumptions about the relative timing of morphological and molecular change to be incorrect  Older molecular dates  by contrast  are consistent with an incomplete fossil record and do not require prior assessments of the fossil record to be unreliable in some way  Here  we compare previous approaches and introduce two new descriptive metrics  Both metrics incorporate information on uncertainty by utilizing the 95  confidence intervals for estimated divergence dates and data on stratigraphic uncertainty for the compared fossils  Metric scores are maximized when these ranges are overlapping  MDI discriminates between situations where molecular estimates are younger or older than known fossils reporting both absolute fit values and a number score for incompatible nodes  DIG range  divergence implied gap range  allows quantification of the minimum increase in implied missing fossil record induced by enforcing a given set of molecular based estimates  These metrics are used together to describe the relationship between time trees and a set of fossil data  which we recommend be phylogenetically vetted and referred on the basis of apomorphy  Differences from previously proposed metrics and the utility of MDI and DIG range are illustrated in three empirical case studies from angiosperms  ostracods  and birds  These case studies also illustrate the ways in which MDI and DIG range may be used to assess time trees resultant from analyses varying in calibration regime  divergence dating approach or molecular sequence data analyzed  
Life history effects and demographic consequences of interacting QTL for flowering and seed dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana  Natural populations of the annual weed Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit natural variation at several major QTL for flowering time and seed dormancy   We conducted a demographic field experiment with selected recombinant inbred lines  RILs  segregating different combinations of late vs  early flowering alleles and strong vs  weak seed dormancy alleles   Seedlings of each line were planted in separate field cages in spring and allowed to disperse seed naturally to establish replicate populations   Each cage was monitored for germination  flowering  and fruiting of successive cohorts over 2 years   The life history effects of flowering time variation depended strongly upon the genetic background at seed dormancy loci  and vice versa  In particular  the combination of early flowering and weak dormancy alleles produced multiple summer germinating rapid cycling generations   Expression of a single generation winter annual life history required both late flowering and strong dormancy alleles   This experimental design allowed us to measure the interacting demographic effects of allelic variation at life history loci under natural field conditions   
Comparative transcriptomics identifies the gene repertoires underlying functional differentiation of spider silk glands  Spiders  Araneae  are exceptional among silk producing arthropods for the diversity of silk types and functions found within and among species  Araneoids  a mega diverse clade of spiders that spin orb webs  sheet webs  and cobwebs  possess up to seven specialized abdominal gland types that each produce silk fibers or glues with distinctive mechanical properties that correspond to a particular function  Some silks have multiple functions  such as the fiber produced by the major ampullate glands  which forms the dragline as well as the frame and radii of the orb web  Other silks are devoted to a single purpose  such as the fibers from the tubuliform glands that are used only to protect eggs  Almost all molecular studies of spider silks have focused on members of the gene family that encode the fibers  primary structural proteins   spidroins  Each of the spidroin paralogs characterized thus far appears to have gland specific expression  For instance  major ampullate silk is composed of two spidroins encoded by MaSp1 and MaSp2  and the egg case silk is primarily composed of the spidroin expressed in the tubuliform glands  TuSp1  Recently  high throughput sequencing of genes expressed in the silk glands of the Western black widow  Latrodectus hesperus  identified  650 transcripts that were significantly more abundant in silk glands than other tissues  suggesting a far more complex silk protein system than previously recognized  Here we describe gene expression patterns of all seven of the functionally differentiated silk gland types in three species of cob web weaving spiders including the Western black widow  GO term analysis of differentially expressed transcripts identified similar functions enriched in each of the differentiated gland types in all three species  including oxidation reduction  extracellular exportation  and lipases  Intriguingly  the identity of these transcripts in each of the individual gland types is unique   e g  different paralogs are expressed in each of the gland types within a single species  Thus  silk glands types share basic functions  with functional differentiation achieved through the evolution of gland specific expression of paralogs  
Transformation of Taxonomic Literature to a Taxon Character Matrix for Phylogenetics  Taxonomic literature contains valuable phenomic data for taxa that often is not included in phylogenetic reconstructions  The goal of this project is to develop tools that will facilitate the extraction of phenomic data from species descriptions  and convert the information into taxon character matrices for phylogenetic analyses   The complete process can be divided in four steps and is achieved using three programs  In the first step  phenomic information is extracted from taxonomic descriptions using CharaParser  Next  the terms that are not recognized are manually classified by the user in the  Ontology Term Organizer Program   OTO http   biosemantics arizona edu ONTNEW     The function of this step is to provide the parsing program with additional information about problematic words  The dataset is then re analyzed using CharaParser and the resulting file is converted into a taxon character matrix using the MatrixMaker software  The MatrixMaker interface facilitates the evaluation of character state homology for each character  and it provides tools to enable the characters to be converted into a discrete character matrix  for use in phylogenetic analyses    We tested the performance of this process using descriptions of the Cycadales  Cycads   The Cycad dataset consisted of generic and species descriptions extracted from the Cycad pages  http   plantnet rbgsyd nsw gov au PlantNet cycad    and it encompassed 300 terminal species   We obtained 647 characters using this process  and 27 20   of them  176 characters  included information from four or more terminals and more than one character state   Overall  38 51   67  of these characters are discrete  31 61   55  are numerical continuous characters  and 29 9   52  were characters with non homologous states that could not be used   We used the remaining 122 characters to reconstruct a morphology only based phylogeny and also a combined molecular morphological supermatrix analysis  Although there was limited support for analyses using morphology alone  the combined analysis provided a credible  comprehensive phylogeny of cycads    
Genetic architecture of developmental traits in populations of male gypsy moths  Local adaptation  characterisic of increased relative fitness of a population of a particular genoytpe over genotypes originating from other habitats  is an important consequence of natural selection operating on fine spatial scales  In this study  we examine the pattern and process of local adaptation and genetic architecture of developmental traits potentially influencing dispersal capacity  larval mass  pupal duration  and developmental time  in male gypsy moths  Lymantria dispar L    a particularly damaging  non native  invasive species  A common garden was established in VA from a local population in addition six other populations from different regions of Virginia  North Carolina  and New York as well as sites in Canada  a fully factorial design is currently under development  In this talk  I present results from a single reference assembly derived from a single individual  created from a paired end sequencing run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument  To this assembly  192 barcoded individuals  from the common garden  differing in source population  were mapped resulting in an individual genotype matrix containing thousands of reliable SNPs  Bayesian Variable Selection Regression  BVSR  as well as standard linear mixed model approaches were employed to explore the relationship between these complex phenotypes and the underlying genetic variation across populations  Understanding the genetic architecture of these characters can serve to inform the control of gypsy moth spread as well as increase understanding of the role of selective forces on invasive species   
 A history of arrivals and subsequent diversification in Madagascar  A case study from the myrrh genus  Commiphora Jacq   Burseraceae     The myrrh genus  Commiphora Jacq   Burseraceae   is the most species rich in the Burseraceae  yet its diversity is poorly understood  We have sampled approximately 61  of species in the genus and over 90  of species from Madagascar  A nearly comprehensive sampling of Madagascan Commiphora has contributed to a molecular phylogeny based on two nuclear  ETS and ITS  and three chloroplast spacers  ndhF rpl32  psbA trnH  and trnD trnT   Previous studies have suggested that Commiphora has resulted from two dispersal events from continental Africa to Madagascar  however  we report a minimum of four such dispersal events  We have estimated the timing of these dispersal events and propose areas of endemism using species range and geographic information  Using this information  we perform ancestral area reconstruction to test three biogeographic hypotheses for each of the four radiations of Madagascar Commiphora  We identify shortcoming for understanding diversification in Madagascar and suggest mechanisms to overcome such challenges   
Molecular systematics of the North American tiger salamander radiation using parallel tagged amplicon sequence data  Resolving the evolutionary history of the North American tiger salamander complex has historically been a challenging endeavor due to limited access to variable sequence based markers and the idiosyncratic patterns of evolution at traditionally informative markers  e g   mtDNA   In recent years  our lab has made use of next generation amplicon sequencing to generate sequence data from a large number of genome wide markers across a large number of individuals distributed across the taxonomic and geographic range of tiger salamanders  These data have been highly informative in delimiting species across the complex  often yielding fine scale resolution of cryptic species lineages not previously recognized in earlier studies  In addition  these data have been informative in producing a robustly resolved species tree for the complex  None of these results were arrived at easily  as we faced numerous challenges in effectively implementing analyses with large genome scale data sets  In this talk we will discuss our systematic disentanglement of the tiger salamander complex  including some of the analytical strategies used to identify robust estimates of phylogenetic history and regions that remain uncertain in their resolution  
Detecting changes in gene expression by high dimensional analysis of codon usage bias  One difficulty in understanding the evolution of codon usage bias is that the space of codon frequencies is high dimensional  This has led to the proposal of several univariate summaries of codon usage  e g  CAI  tAI  etc    However  additional insight may be gained by considering information that is discarded when computing these univariate summaries  Here we analyze the high dimensional geometry of expected codon usage under a  mutation selection drift model where the strength of selection on translational efficiency is determined by gene expression level  Taking account of amino acid usage results in a 40 dimensional codon usage space  but at equilibrium the expected codon usage of a gene whose expression level is constant over evolutionary time must lie on a one dimensional curve  Surprisingly  even genes whose expression levels are allowed to change arbitrarily through evolutionary time have expected frequencies that are restricted to a tiny fraction of codon usage space  We apply this geometric analysis to understand patterns of codon usage across the yeast genome  In particular  we sort all genes into three sets  genes whose codon usage is well explained by a constant expression level  genes whose codon usage is well explained by an expression level that changes over evolutionary time  and genes whose codon usage cannot be explained by arbitrary time varying selection on translational efficiency  
Genetic variation for photosynthetic traits within and among populations of the C3 C4 intermediate Mollugo verticillata   Photosynthetic adaptations such as evolution of C4 and CAM are some of the most convergent adaptations in biology  The most widely known examples of photosynthetic adaptations are CAM and C4 photosynthesis  These adaptations have likely arisen to limit photorespiration by increasing the concentration of CO2 within the leaf  C4 photosynthesis alone has evolved more than 60 times from the ancestral C3 mode of photosynthesis  C4 species are more common in hot dry environments suggesting that this mode of photosynthesis arose as adaptation to limit photorespiration in hot dry climates  There have been many studies demonstrating physiological variation between C4 and C3 species  In addition  many studies have demonstrated macroevolutionary patterns among plant families or species in photosynthetic traits  However  we do not know much about variation within species or within populations of a single species for traits that underlie photosynthetic adaptations  If there is variation within and among populations  we can begin to study the microevolutionary aspects of the evolution of photosynthetic adaptations  Here I quantify genetic variation within and between populations of the C3 C4 intermediate Mollugo verticillata for CO2 compensation point  CO2 compensation point is the internal CO2 concentration where photorespiration and photosynthesis are balanced  The two study populations located in alternate climatic environments within California  One population is located in near the coast under a cool climate  and the other population is located inland under a hotter climate  I measure the CO2 compensation point of both populations under hot and cool temperatures to test the hypothesis that there are genetically based differences between populations  and I quantify genetic variation within each population  This study demonstrates how characters that are usually studied in a macroevolutionary context can vary at the microevolutionary scale  From here we can begin to examine the microevolutionary aspects of how photosynthetic adaptations evolve  
Genetic basis of adaptive behavior  do proximate genetic mechanisms suggest evolutionary causes   Thanks to advances in genetics and genomics  dissecting the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypes is now possible in many evolutionarily interesting species   As a result our understanding of the genetics of adaptive traits is better than ever before   How informative these data are about the evolutionary mechanisms shaping these traits remains unclear   Using case studies of genetic and evolutionary analyses of chemosensory behavior in fruit flies  we show how incomplete information affects inference about evolutionary mechanisms  Underpowered tests of selection  the complications of population history  and the idiosyncrasies of specific genes can result in incomplete or biased results   Our data suggest that genome wide genetic analysis and direct functional tests of adaptive alleles are critical for understanding how observed genetic differences contributed to the evolution of an adaptive trait    
Gene family evolution and functional plasticity following whole genome duplication events in plants  Polyploidy  whole genome duplication  in plants is well documented  and most plant genomes exhibit evidence of repeated whole genome duplication in their evolutionary history  However  less is known about the way such recurring duplication events affect well established gene families which often have strong selective constraints on their copy number and functional localization  In this study  we focus on the omega 3 fatty acid desaturase gene family and its evolution within the Rosid clade  This gene family is involved in the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids  a type of fatty acid that has been linked to cold temperature adaptation in plants  In addition to the existing gene function data available for Arabidopsis thaliana  we performed de novo localization and stress response analysis in cotton and used the published genome sequences of arabidopsis  papaya  cotton  cacao  and grape to elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of the genomic regions containing these genes  Using a combination of phylogenetic  synteny  and functional analyses  we identified signals of copy number reduction post polyploidy in the genomes of arabidopsis and paleo polyploid cotton and likely sub functionalization into organs under selection in cultivated neo polyploid cotton  Moreover  we show that similar  and likely anciently established  stress response functions are performed by different members of the gene family in arabidopsis and cotton due to gene copy loss following polyploidy duplication in the arabidopsis lineage   
The relative importance of primary and secondary resources in adaptive radiation  The most thoroughly studied adaptive radiations  including Darwin s finches and the cichlid fishes of the African rift lakes  have revealed adaptation to primary resources as a major driving force  both the finches and the fishes have mainly diversified with respect to feeding apparatus   Few studies of adaptive radiations have investigated diversification with respect to secondary resources such as enemy free space   Here we study gall morphology in an incipient radiation of gall making midges  nominally referred to as Asteromyia carbonifera  Diptera  Cecidomyiidae    These galls are attacked by up to 7 different parasitoids that apply significant selection pressure on gall thickness and diameter   Gall morphology has responded to this pressure  which has resulted in the maintenance of several sympatric and even syntopic gall morphotypes   We test the relative importance of plant genotype and enemies in driving diversification in this system through the production of adaptive landscape surfaces and calculation of selection gradients  
The Geographical and Community Context of Mutualism Dynamics  Fig Pollinator Parasite Interactions in the Sonoran Desert  Mutualisms are ubiquitous and profoundly influential in shaping ecological and coevolutionary interactions of plants and animals  Our understanding of mutualism  however  has suffered from a lack of spatial  geographical  and ecological  community  context  a context that must be considered to fully understand the fitness costs and benefits of mutualism and its persistence over ecological and evolutionary time  This talk investigates how plant population size and reproductive traits are influenced by environmental gradients and how their variation influences local  and geographical scale dynamics in a pollination mutualism subject to parasitism  We focus on a fig fig wasp mutualism composed of Ficus petiolaris and its species specific fig wasp pollinator  as well a well defined community of parasites comprised of seed eating fig wasps that do not function as pollinators  and a nematode parasite of the pollinator  Sonoran Desert populations of F  petiolaris  a rock strangler  are often small and spatially isolated and  according to theory  subject to high risk of local pollinator extinction and mutualism failure  We test the hypothesis that where host populations are small  mutualism may be stabilized by reproductive adjustments in the fig  namely increased intra crown asynchrony in flower and fruit production and longer receptivity of individual flowers to pollinators  We also test the hypothesis that these reproductive adjustments may have significant costs by potentially benefiting parasites that negatively impact fig seed and pollinator production  The patchy distribution of F  petiolaris  its high within crown flowering asynchrony  atypical of figs  and high parasite loads  as well as potential interactions among these factors  make this an interestingly complex yet well defined system for evaluating these hypotheses and the impact of environmental and biotic stressors on the fitness and persistence of mutualism   
Beyond aggression  antiandrogen treatment of subordinate males modifies social behavior in wild meerkats  Androgen function is best understood in the context of mediating male reproductive and aggressive behavior  often at the cost of male involvement in parenting or prosocial activity  Among members of social species  testosterone is typically invoked to explain rank related differences  however  its role within a rank  particularly among subordinates  is underappreciated  We explored the actions of testosterone in subordinate  male members of a cooperatively breeding species  the meerkat  Suricata suricatta   No rank related testosterone differences have been observed in male meerkats  yet subordinate helpers rarely reproduce and  relative to dominant breeders  perform more infant care  We manipulated testosterone  in the field  by treating well habituated  subordinate males  in multiple groups  with an antiandrogen  21 day release flutamide pellets  s c    During a month of the breeding season in the Kalahari  we monitored androgen concentrations  via baseline serum and time sequential fecal sampling  and recorded behavior using a focal observation protocol  Relative to controls  flutamide treated animals initiated less and received more high intensity aggression  biting  threatening  feeding competition   initiated more prosocial behavior  social sniffing  grooming  huddling   and less frequently assumed the  dominant  role during social play  pinning while wrestling  play mounting  chasing   Although interfering with the actions of testosterone produced the anticipated depressive effects on aggression  while enhancing prosociality  treatment also revealed rare evidence of testosterone s activational effects on adult play  Despite a focus on  low profile  males  our findings show a more pervasive role for androgens in adult social behavior than is traditionally recognized  with possible relevance for understanding tradeoffs in the evolution of cooperative systems  Funded by NSF IOS 1021633  
Arms and Armor  ecomorphological diversification in the girdled lizards  The Cordylidae is a species poor but ecologically and morphologically diverse family of lizards endemic to sub Saharan Africa  Although the majority of the cordylid species are strictly rupicolous  the family also contains a diverse array of other specialist ecotypes  Due to this concentrated ecological and morphological variation  the family has been proposed as an excellent system for studying macroevolutionary processes  Previous studies have hypothesized that the majority of diversity in the family evolved rapidly at the base of the viviparous subfamily  Cordylinae   possibly representing an adaptive radiation  but this has not been investigated empirically  A time calibrated phylogeny was produced  using an 11 gene  squamate wide dataset with ten fossil calibrations  Morphological variation of the Cordylidae was quantified through a combination of standardized ecomorphological measurements and novel  volumetric measurements of osteoderm distributions recovered using High Resolution CT scanning  Ecological data for known cordylid localities was extracted from multiple commonly used climate layers  and the dataset binned into a series of discrete microhabitat types  The phylogenetic analysis reveals that viviparous cordylines underwent a period of rapid cladogenesis across the Oligocene Miocene boundary  radiating into nine well  supported lineages  distributed around the edge of the great escarpment in South Africa   Morphological variation was shown to be correlated with microhabitat choice  but not with climatic variation  Finally  a series of existing and novel disparity based analytical techniques reveal that the viviparous cordylids experienced an early burst of morphological diversification  while the oviparous subfamily  Platysaurinae  did not  These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the live bearing Cordylinae underwent a period of adaptive radiation during the Oligocene  possibly as a result of shifts in the climate and geological uplift of South Africa s Great Escarpment  
Identifying a potential for early assortative mating between the morphs of Giant Kelp down its environmental gradient along Central California s coast  Organisms living along environmental gradients often utilize phenotypic plasticity to maximize their survival across a range of conditions  Wherever gradients occur  there is potential for divergence through isolation by adaptation  IBA  to build up between genotypes experiencing different selective pressures  Plasticity in traits pertaining to mating systems in particular are likely to constitute an interesting and revealing model for the study of the underlying mechanisms behind parapatric speciation  Giant kelp  Macrocystis spp   shows striking plasticity in holdfast morphology and reproductive strategy when colonizing intertidal  M  integrifolia morph  versus subtidal  M  pyrifera morph  areas along temperate rocky coastlines of the eastern Pacific Ocean  In the intertidal  high photosynthetically active radiation  PAR  and UV radiation limit development of spores  recruitment of microscopic gametophytes  and growth and survival of embryonic sporophytes of M  pyrifera  Although depth of parent sporophytes influences spore survival in irradiance stressed environments  few studies have examined the effects of irradiance stress on M  integrifolia s developmental stages  This study focuses on understanding the roles of IBA and plasticity in maintaining Macrocystis morphs along the California coastline  To test for genetic isolation caused by ecological divergence in the intertidal  we performed fine scale spatial sampling and molecular analysis of parapatric intertidal and subtidal populations off of the Central Californian coast  Using seven microsatellite markers  we compared genetic differentiation between morphs within sites and among morphs across different sites  Furthermore  we identified the presence of clonal replicates in intertidal populations  Results show higher differentiation between adjacent subtidal and intertidal morphs than between the same morph at larger spatial scales  suggesting isolation by adaptation  Several potential mechanisms could explain this result  assortative or other non random mating  longer generation times promoted by asexual growth  intertidal morph   and differential mortality due to early adaptive divergence  Spatial analyses of clonal structure do not indicate asexual reproduction as the dominant strategy in the intertidal  To explore the hypothesis of differential mortality due to adaptive divergence  we will experimentally test assortative mating at different early development stages using controlled crosses of the two morphs under different treatments of irradiance  PAR and UV  stress  Surviving embryonic sporophytes will be genotyped and a paternity analysis will be conducted  Specifically  we hypothesize offspring from M  pyrifera parents will experience higher than expected mortality under irradiance stress  such that paternity analyses will reveal lower than expected numbers of M  pyrifera offspring among surviving embryonic sporophytes  
Microsatellites as Targets of Natural Selection  Microsatellites   short tandem repeats   are highly polymorphic loci routinely used as neutral markers in population genetics  Microsatellites also contribute to morphological and behavioral evolution  control variation in gene expression throughout the genome  and cause disease  suggesting they are often targeted by natural selection  Existing population genetic models of selection and methods for its characterization  which focus on variants with low mutation rates such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs   are not appropriate for microsatellites  We developed models that flexibly describe the microsatellite fitness surface  along with realistic models of mutation based on microsatellite characteristics  We implemented a statistical approach that uses approximate Bayesian computation  ABC  to choose the models and parameter values that best fit microsatellite polymorphism data  Cross validation simulations revealed that our method offers high power and low false positive rates in distinguishing selection from neutrality  We applied our approach to microsatellite genotypes from an Italian population of humans  A collection of microsatellites chosen as a priori candidates for selection showed a range of selective regimes  whereas loci far from genes mostly displayed neutral patterns  Both microsatellites that affect gene expression  located in promoters  and those that change protein structure  located in exons  were inferred to be targeted by selection  Some microsatellites known to cause disease appeared to evolve neutrally  By providing an initial portrait of microsatellite fitness surfaces  our results underscore the significance of considering non SNP variation for understanding the effects of natural selection across the genome  
Playing smart and playing safe  the joint expression of phenotypic plasticity and diversification bet hedging  Adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves when cues reliably predict fitness consequences of life history decisions  whereas bet hedging evolves when environments are unpredictable   These modes of response should be jointly expressed  because environmental variance is composed of both predictable and unpredictable components  but little attention has been paid to their joint expression   Here  I examine the simultaneous expression of plasticity in germination rate and two potential bet hedging traits germination fraction and within season diversification in timing of germination in seeds from multiple seed families of five geographically distant populations of Lobelia inflata  L   subjected to a thermal gradient   Populations differ in germination plasticity to temperature  in total germination fraction  and in the expression of potential diversification in the timing of germination   The observation of a negative partial correlation between the expression of plasticity and germination variance  potential diversification   and a positive correlation between plasticity and germination fraction are suggestive of a tradeoff between modes of response to environmental variance   If the observed correlations are indicative of those between adaptive plasticity and bet hedging  we expect an optimal balance to exist and differ among populations  However  the assessment of local adaptation to a particular level of environmental variation remains a challenge  and I propose the potential utility of dendrochronological methods  
A systematic approach to investigate allele specific gene function in the North American gray wolf  A principal objective in biology is to connect ecologically important traits to their genetic underpinnings  Discovering such genotype phenotype associations in natural populations is important for answering fundamental evolutionary questions  yet few associations have been identified in non model species  We are studying the role of a coding sequence deletion in the canine beta defensin 3  CBD103  gene  which is known to result in black coat color and has undergone a selective sweep in North American gray wolves  Canis lupus   We hypothesize that the CBD103 deletion also affects immune defense  as population modeling supports allele specific fitness effects that are independent of coat color  We have established and are utilizing wolf cell lines to experimentally test allele specific functions of CBD103  as in vivo studies are not feasible for this species  Cell lines were successfully established from skin samples from ten North American wolves  and additional tissues were collected from a CBD103 wildtype wolf for gene expression analyses  CBD103 is lowly expressed in fibroblasts but highly expressed in keratinocytes and epithelial tissues  suggesting that CBD103 plays a role in immune defense  Our cell lines afford the opportunity to experimentally manipulate allele specific expression of CBD103 and will provide proof of concept for using cell culture to test functions of candidate genes in other non model species  
Structure of geno  and phenotypic variation in a radiation of island amphibians  The Seychelles archipelago  partially a microcontinent  is unique among isolated island systems because of the occurrence of  possibly ancient  radiations of amphibians that have been separated from mainland relatives for at least 65 million years  One of these radiations contains six nominal species in three genera of a relatively unknown order  Gymnophiona   the limbless caecilians  The Seychelles species are unique in comprising the only island radiation of caecilians worldwide  and for a small group they have notable morphological and ecological diversity  However  little previous work has been carried out and the group s internal phylogenetic relationships have defied resolution  As with other amphibians  caecilians are considered intolerant to saltwater  yet all but one Seychelles species occurs on more than one island  raising questions about within  and among island variation  and gene flow  and potential cryptic taxonomic diversity  Based on extensive fieldwork  > 1 000 person days   we have identified new island records for some species  Analyses of multilocus molecular and external and cranial morphological data indicate that intraspecific variation is not similarly spatially structured in all species  and that differences do not wholly match predictions from ecology  Phylogenetic analyses provide support for at least one previously unidentified species and a possible case of convergent dwarfism within Seychelles caecilians   
 Divergent and geographically distinct mitochondrial lineages occur despite apparent nuclear gene flow in the Texas Coralsnake  Micrurus tener   Incongruent geographic patterns of mitochondrial  mtDNA  and nuclear  nDNA  variation have been previously demonstrated in diverse groups of vertebrates  including squamate reptiles  The causes of this phenomenon are often thought to be sex biased gene flow  adaptation  introgression  or demographic shifts  although these explanations have only rarely been tested  Here we describe an exceptional case of mito nuclear discordance in the venomous Texas Coralsnake  Micrurus tener  This species occurs from Louisiana and Texas in the United States southward to northern Mexico  To characterize geographic patterns of DNA variation in M  tener  we generated a multilocus mtDNA dataset and a large nDNA genome wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism  SNP  dataset  Specifically  we sequenced two mtDNA gene fragments for 80 snakes  ca  1 500 bp  and used double digest RADseq to collect a nDNA SNP set for 43 snakes  The mtDNA data identified two divergent lineages within M  tener that are essentially geographically distinct  and that were rendered paraphyletic by its sister species  M  fulvius  In stark contrast  the nDNA SNPs suggest panmixia among individuals belonging to these two divergent M  tener mtDNA lineages  To identify historical and or demographic scenarios most likely to have produced mito nuclear discordance in M  tener  we used a partial Micrurus genome assembly  morphological measurements  and climate data  to test for patterns associated with competing explanations  Our results highlight the utility of reduced representation genome sampling to evaluate population genetic and phylogeographic questions  and to test hypotheses based on mtDNA data  
A History of High Latitude Adaptation in Holarctic Ground Squirrels  Urocitellus   The evolution of squirrels has been strongly influenced by global climatic and tectonic changes  However  the general  adaptability  of squirrels may be best investigated within the context of their response to selective pressures in the most extreme environments  To address this  we analyzed the phylogeny  biogeographic history and morphological adaptation of Holarctic ground squirrels  Urocitellus   a genus that includes multiple high latitude species as well as the northernmost ground squirrel species in the world  the Arctic ground squirrel  U  parryii   We inferred phylogenetic relationships and past distributional shifts in Urocitellus using multilocus Bayesian methods and ancestral range reconstructions  In addition  we employed geometric morphometric data and comparative analyses to examine the evolution of body size and cranial shape along the Urocitellus phylogeny as well as the association of both these traits with life at high latitudes  Preliminary results suggest that colonization of the arctic occurred early in the diversification of Urocitellus  and that increased body size   one adaptation to such habitats   has generated strong allometric changes in cranial shape among these species  
 All roads lead to Rome  in the development of a vestigial eye  Convergent evolution between Eurycea rathbuni and Astyanax mexicanus  The south central Texas Eurycea clade exhibits a continuum of karst salamander phenotypes  The Texas blind salamander  E  rathbuni  is considered a stygobiont because it completes its life cycle in the aquatic subterranean habitat of the Edwards Aquifer where it lives in perpetual darkness  Consequently  E  rathbuni exhibits a broad head  gracile limbs  limited pigmentation and highly reduced eyes  In contrast  the Barton Springs salamander  E  sosorum  is epigean and is endemic to surface habitats  it exhibits small robust limbs  pigmentation  and well developed eyes  To determine the sequence of events during development that lead to widely disparate ocular outcomes and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible  embryos at various stages of development were obtained from the two species  E  sosorum and E  rathbuni  and sectioned using a Shandon cryotome  Five developmental stages of E  sosorum  and six developmental stages of E  rathbuni were identified  and sections taken from these embryos were labeled for Pax6 and Shh using immunohistochemistry  Images were obtained using an Olympus FV 1000 scanning confocal microscope  Expression of Pax6 and Shh proteins is observed in both morphotypes represented by E  rathbuni and E  sosorum  Eurycea sosorum maintained expression of pax6 and shh through embryogenesis and into a juvenile stage  Decreased labeling of Pax6 protein was observed during later stages of E  rathbuni development  while Shh protein labeling was increased in a select subset of cells surrounding the brain and eye  Interestingly  these results parallel pax6 and shh expression in two morphotypes explored in Astyanax mexicanus  suggesting some degree of convergent evolution in the developmental mechanisms that lead to the development of vestigial eyes  
Does Ecological Speciation Explain the Origin of Tropical Savanna Woody Flora   Tropical savanna is a relatively recent biome  arising in the past 6 to 10 million years  concurrent with the increased dominance of C4 grasses across many areas of the globe  Following this expansion of highly flammable grasses  there has arisen species rich flora of woody plants that gave rise to the savanna biome  Using the Brazilian Cerrado as a case study  I examined three lines of evidence to explore the hypothesis that the highly diverse woody plant flora arose largely as a result of ecological speciation driven by vegetation fire feedbacks  Using a published flora of the region and available phylogenetic information  I estimate that savanna woody plants have evolved from tropical forest lineages in at least 115 separate lineages  revealing that a large fraction of speciation events are associated with a switch in biome  Using trait data from a subset of species pairs  I fitted the Ornstein Uhlenbeck model of evolution  revealing strongest selective pressure on traits that confer fire tolerance  Finally  using a demographic based model of natural selection and trait evolution  I found that gradients in fire frequency across savanna forest boundaries are sufficiently sharp to permit genetic differentiation over small spatial scales  The conditions necessary for this differentiation arise because of positive feedbacks between fire and vegetation that result in sharp transitions in flammability  vegetation structure and species composition  Together these results support the hypothesis of fire driven ecological speciation and suggest that diversification was driven by evolutionary feedbacks that arose naturally from ecological feedbacks  
Macro  and microevolutionary perspectives on the evolution of terrestrial egg laying in frogs  The ability to reproduce away from water has evolved repeatedly in animals but the way that organisms shift from one state  reproducing in water  to an alternative state  reproducing out of water  is not well understood  Amphibians are ideal organisms for studying this transition as non aquatic forms of reproduction have evolved more than 50 times independently  Using a group of South and Central American treefrogs in the genus Dendropsophus that span from aquatic to terrestrial egg laying  I have been studying variation in adult behavior and embryo development  Aquatic egg laying is ancestral and fixed terrestrial reproduction has evolved several times in the genus  with flexible reproduction being found in multiple species as the most probable intermediate stage  Furthermore  it appears that terrestrial oviposition behavior evolves before embryo adaptations for developing in air that preclude development in water  Although selection from aquatic predators pushes frogs to lay eggs out of water  comparing populations of the species Dendropsophus ebraccatus demonstrates that obligate terrestrial egg laying can only evolve in environments which are wet enough to prevent egg desiccation on land  This has implications for our understanding of the evolution of terrestriality and  more generally  the role of plasticity in evolution   
Linking neotropical biomes in a spider web  There is a general agreement that the evolutionary history of neotropical diversity is very complex and still poorly understood  More recently  phylogeographic approaches have been adding many valuable pieces to this great puzzle  providing inferences about the past events that shaped the species present distribution  Most of phylogeographic studies focus on species endemic or restricted to one biome  but the study of species with broad geographic ranges can also provide interesting information  To conduct a comparative phylogeography study we choose three spider species that can be found in most part of Brazil  Araneus venatrix  Araneidae   Aglaoctenus lagotis  Lycosidae  and Nephila clavipes  Nephilidae   We aimed to cover the main biomes  sampling on 54 sites along the Brazilian Amazonia Rainforest  the Atlantic Rainforest and the Cerrado  Brazilian Savanna   We have analyzed partial sequences of nuclear ITS2 for A venatrix and partial sequences of mitochondrial COI gene for the three species  The patterns found for A lagotis and A venatrix in the bayesian phylogenetic inference and haplotype network are remarkably similar  with three geographically structured clusters  a deep lineage split during the Pliocene or late Miocene  separating the populations of Southern Atlantic Rainforest from all others  later  an early Pleistocene split formed a clade that occurs in the South Central region and another comprising populations from Amazonia  Cerrado and Northern Atlantic Rainforest  Nephila clavipes presented four clusters that have split on the Pleistocene  one along the Atlantic Forest  one in the Amazonia and two in the Central and South part of the country  In each lineage  diversification occurred during Pleistocene  for the three species  reinforcing this period as one of intense lineage diversification  Our results corroborate a subdivision between the Tropical and Temperate portions of South America  possibly associated with orogenic events during Miocene and Pliocene  showing that the Amazonia  Northern Atlantic Forest and Cerrado are not evolutionary isolated units and that the histories of Neotropical biomes are not independent  
Cryptic and not so cryptic species complexes in sea cucumbers reveal rapid rates of secondary sympatry  Having a clear understanding of species limits and their distributions are critical to formulate hypotheses about the speciation  and the relative contributions of ecological and historical factors that govern their distributions  In the sea  where geographical barriers to gene flow are rare  the potential for long ranging dispersal is high  and the taxonomy of most groups chaotic  basic information about the identity of species and their geographical distribution is lacking  Large scale biodiversity surveys combined with barcode sequencing speed up the documentation of this basic information and allows for the identification of species complexes  Here  we illustrate how by studying in detail two species complexes of sea cucumbers identified with this approach  we gain insights into the dynamics of their diversification  Holothuria impatiens first described from the Red Sea  was thought to occur across the Indo Pacific  the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Seas  We combined nuclear and mitochondrial markers  using phylogenetic methods and the multispecies coalescent to show that   H  impatiens   is actually a complex of at least 13 reciprocally monophyletic species  Some are restricted to an oceanic bassin  while others are wide ranging  None but one species can be told apart based on the morphological character typically used in sea cucumber taxonomy  shape of microscopic calcareous skeletal elements   Most can however be distinguished based on their live appearance coloration  We used a similar approach to demonstrate that the three species in the Holothuria edulis complex easily distinguishable morphologically but not with mitochondrial data  are most likely reproductively isolated  In both complexes  we found that species that diverged less than 100 000 years ago are co occuring  This pattern contrasts with what has been found in other marine invertebrates where it typically takes over 5 millions years for sister species to co occur  The biological mechanisms that allow for such rapid rates of secondary sympatry need to be investigated  in order to understand the variety of processes that have generated the high diversity characterizing the Indo Pacific biota

What is the link between transmission ratio distortion and sterility in Mimulus hybrids   Recent work has provided insight into the molecular functions and evolutionary histories of genes involved in hybrid dysfunction  but we have yet to answer what might be the key question for speciation  which population genetic forces and selective agents drive the initial substitutions within species that lead to incompatibilities between species  Here I focus on a simple genetic incompatibility that causes nearly complete male sterility and partial female sterility in hybrids between two closely related yellow monkeyflower species  Mimulus guttatus and M  nasutus  I have mapped the two major incompatibility loci   hybrid male sterility 1  hms1  and hybrid male sterility 2  hms2    to small nuclear genomic regions that contain only a handful of genes and include strong candidates  In addition to causing hybrid sterility  these same two regions show strong transmission ratio distortion in hybrids  To investigate the connection between these hybrid phenotypes and determine whether distortion occurs through male or female gametes  I performed a crossing experiment using nearly isogenic lines that segregate only at hms1 and hms2  I also tested whether transmission ratio distortion at these loci occurs exclusively in hybrid genetic backgrounds or also occurs within species  The latter would provide direct evidence that intragenomic conflict plays a role in the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities  
Rapid phylogeny construction from next gen sequencing data  Whole genome sequence data provides exciting opportunities to estimate phylogenies accurately  We have developed software  which we call SISRS  pronounced  scissors   that rapidly extracts an alignment of variable  homologous sites from next gen data  regardless of synteny  using a composite assembly and custom filters  We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of this approach using simulated and empirical data from genome and transcriptome sequencing  For each empirical dataset  we identified hundreds of thousands of variable sites  resulting in a fully supported  bifurcating tree  
Evidence of pathogen induced recombination among low fitness lineages of Drosophila melanogaster  Hosts mount a multitude of responses to mitigate fitness losses from infection  But  we do not know whether such responses depend on fitness or alter the evolutionary potential of infected hosts  Theory predicts that fitness associated maternal effects can accelerate the rate of adaptive evolution  particularly when low fitness mother produce daughters with high rates of meiotic recombination  Here we provide evidence for this phenomenon when the fruit fly  Drosophia melanogaster  is topically infected with the fungal pathogen  Metarhizium robertsii   We show that this response only occurs in chronically infected lineages  which suggests that fly lineages only re shuffle their genome when they have low fitness for multiple generations  These findings indicate that pathogen induced maternal effects on recombination could be an effective mechanism for accelerating the adaptation of low fitness lineages to pathogen rich environments   
Island and continental biogeography dynamics in the assembly of the Western Ghats  India  avifauna  The Indian subcontinent is a biogeographic enigma with high species richness yet low endemism  despite a long history of isolation before reaching its current geographic position  The origins of montane species in the Western Ghats  a biodiversity hotspot in southwestern India  have long been debated  The prevailing hypothesis for birds is that Himalayan taxa were able disperse to the Western Ghats at a time when peninsular India was covered in moist forest and later these populations were isolated as the subcontinent dried up  We analyzed a majority of Western Ghats endemic species by examining phylogenetic relationships and ancestral area reconstructions to decipher potential routes of colonization  Western Ghats endemics have their closest relatives in different geographic regions and appear to have colonized India from all four possible source directions and at different times  The assemblage of the Indian avifauna is driven as much by island biogeography dynamics as vicariance events  
Molecular evolution of the RH2 opsin complex in Neotropical cichlid fish  are they different or just slower than African cichlids   Cichlid fishes are very colorful   they are called Buntbarsche  colored perches in German   and they possess one of the most diverse visual systems among vertebrates  This made them an important system for the study of how visual sensitivity evolves in response to natural and sexual selection  The adaptive molecular evolution of opsin proteins in cichlids from the African Great Lakes is strongly correlated to their recent adaptive radiation and their pronounced sexual dimorphism in coloration  Much less is known about the visual system of Neotropical cichlids  the sister lineage of African cichlids  Work on the Trinidadian pike cichlid suggests that Neotropical cichlids might have a reduce set of opsins  particularly in the green sensitive RH2 complex where only one paralog of the three found in African cichlids appears to be functional   This  coupled with the fact that the radiation of Neotropical cichlids is ancient and sexual dimorphism in coloration is not the norm in this lineage  suggests that the rate of adaptive molecular evolution might be lower in Neotropical than in African cichlids   To test this hypothesis  we compared the molecular evolution of the RH2 opsins between Neotropical and African cichlids  We characterized the diversity of RH2 opsin genes in the Neotropical lineage by taking advantage of the ongoing Amphilophus citrinellus species complex genome project  Then  we sequenced these opsins in Neotropical lake cichlids and combined it with published sequences from African lake cichlids to look for evidence of selection  We found functional copies of three paralogs of RH2  RH2B and two RH2A  in Neotropical lake cichlids  which parallels those found in African cichlids  This might imply a date for the RH2A duplication event before the divergence of the African and Neotropical lineages  However  we cannot completely discard the hypothesis that there have been independent duplication events  Furthermore  we found evidence for positive selection in green sensitive opsins of Neotropical cichlids  as previously found for rhodopsin  However  the signatures of selection were consistently weaker in Neotropical cichlids when compared to those seen in the opsin genes of African cichlids  This is potentially due to the rarity of sexual dimorphism in coloration in the Neotropical lineage  which might tend to reduce reinforcement on the molecular evolution of opsins due to sexual selection  Comparisons between the opsin proteins of Neotropical and African cichlids has the potential to further our understanding of the adaptive evolution of visual systems in response to natural and sexual selection  
Multicellular evolution in the volvocine algae evolved through genetic permanence of a predator evasion response in unicellular Chlamydomonas  The current view of multicellular evolution is that ecological pressures such as predation and or scarce resources drive genetic permanence of cellular cooperation  It has been assumed that the simplest mechanism to evolve multicellularity is clonal development  where incomplete cell division results in cell cell attachment forming a multicellular organism  Since clonal development is thought to be easy to evolve the presumption is that this mechanism underlies multicellular evolution in most taxa  including plants and animals  Aggregative cooperation is another mechanism of multicellular evolution that is observed in social amoeba  slime molds  and other organisms  where cells in the environment aggregate in response to stress  which provides them safety in numbers  and motility advantages  As this behavior is thought to be genetically complex  the assumption is that aggregative cooperation has a higher barrier for its evolution and thus is a less common mechanism of multicellular evolution  However  we found that predation of unicellular Chlamydomonas cells results in cellular aggregative cooperation within minutes of predator treatment  We have found that interaction of Chlamydomonas with predators causes the algae to release a signal that when added to naive Chlamydomonas cell causes them to aggregate  Moreover  Chlamydomonas will only aggregate with genetically similar strains  not other species with in the same genus  nor other closely related algae  This suggests that the aggregation signal elicits a self self recognition mechanism for aggregation  Subsequently  we have performed RNA seq on a time course of predator treatment and identified genes important for the predator response  Finally  by analyzing the orthologs to these genes in Chlamydomonas to those in its multicellular relatives such as Gonium and Volvox we have determined the evolutionary history of genes important for multicellular evolution  In summary  our data reveal an unrealized mechanism by which unicellular Chlamydomonas communicates the presence of predators and allows them to interpret this signal to determine if they should aggregate  resulting in groups that are more resistant to predation  These data suggest aggregative cooperation may be a more common mechanism of multicellular evolution than currently thought  We also have the first insight between selective pressure and the underlying genetic mechanism by which multicellularity evolved in the volvocine algae  
Genetic mapping of horizontal stripes in Lake Victoria cichlid fishes  benefits and pitfalls of using of dense linkage mapping using RAD markers  The genetic dissection of naturally occurring phenotypes sheds light on many fundamental and longstanding questions in speciation and adaptation and is a central research topic in evolutionary biology  Until recently  forward genetic approaches were virtually impossible to apply to non model organisms  but the development of next generation sequencing techniques made this now possible  Here  we apply the ddRAD seq method to map a color trait with a known adaptive function in cichlid fish  well known examples of rapid rates of speciation and phenotypic diversification  A suite of morphological traits are related to speciation and adaptation in cichlids  among which body coloration features prominently  The focal trait of the present study  horizontal stripes are rare in cichlids  but evolved in several cichlid radiations repeatedly and are associated with an elongated body shape and piscivorous foraging behavior  Additionally  we directly quantify the genotyping error rates in RAD markers and offer guidelines for identifying and dealing with errors in NGS based datasets  We conducted interspecific crosses between two endemic cichlid fish from Lake Victoria in East Africa  Haplochromis sauvagei and H  nyererei  and constructed a saturated linkage map with 867 SNP markers distributed on 22 linkage groups and total size of 1130 63cM  Lateral stripes are inherited as a Mendelian trait and map to a single genomic interval of 300Kb that harbors 15 genes  among them a paralog of a gene with known function in stripe patterning  Dorsolateral and midlateral stripes were always inherited together and are thus probably under the same genetic control  Uncritical marker selection was found to severely impact accurate linkage map construction  Fortunately  by applying appropriate quality control steps  a genotyping accuracy of >99 9  can be reached  Thus  allowing for efficient linkage mapping of evolutionarily relevant traits  
Modular color evolution facilitated by a complex nanostructure  Understanding how complex traits diversify remains an important question in evolutionary biology  Extensive evidence suggests that the genetic and developmental architecture of complex traits can channel evolutionary change  However  in many cases selection acts on functional properties of complex traits rather than directly on morphology  Thus  with functional traits  the way that form maps to function can be crucial in understanding how such traits respond to selection  Feather colors in birds are among the most diverse phenotypes in nature and can be produced either by selective light absorption by pigments  pigment based colors   or light scattering from nanoscale structures varying in refractive index  structural colors   Based on the deterministic association between structural color and its producing components  an increase in the number of tunable morphological parameters may increase the number of free optical parameters  Such innovations have been shown to result in accelerated color diversification and the opportunity to occupy novel areas of colorspace  However  the mechanisms by which these flexible templates might favor or channel the evolution of colors relies on understanding i  how added morphological complexity enables the evolution of multiple  independent evolutionary modules and ii  how these structural modules map to color attributes  both of which remain unknown in an evolutionary context  Many species of dabbling ducks  Anatini  have a remarkably conspicuous patch of colorful plumage in their wings  the speculum   which is often momomorphic  found in both males and females  and in most species is iridescent  These gaudy plumage patches vary considerably in color and have been shown in some species to be sexually selected and used as visual signals in mate attraction and male male competition signals  The structure responsible for producing these iridescent speculum colors is a 2 dimensional photonic crystal formed by the arrangement of small  100 200 nm  melanin granules  melanosomes  into a hexagonal pattern  Here  we ask how this complex template affects the independent variation  evolvability  of color attributes  Using a combination of electron microscopy  reflectance spectrophotometry  and multivariate comparative methods  we show that morphological complexity causes functional decoupling among color variables  allowing them to evolve independently and at different rates  By explicitly studying evolutionary trends in both form and function  our results demonstrate that color evolvability is facilitated by the functional architecture of the system rather than covariation among morphological traits  e g   due to shared genetic or developmental pathways   These results are important because they show how internal features of organisms  e g   innovations in the form function map  relate to macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic diversity and therefore might help explain why some clades are more color diverse than others  
Do color assortative female preferences generate reproductive isolation in a polymorphic frog   The extent to which sexual selection contributes to the generation of reproductive isolation among incipient species remains a question of theoretical and empirical interest in evolutionary biology  Studies of recently or nearly isolated lineages  where the action of current barriers can be directly observed  arguably provide the best test of sexual selection s role in reproductive isolation  The striking diversity in coloration exhibited by the poison frog Oophaga pumilio in and around the Bocas del Toro Archipelago of Panama is thought to have arisen recently and rapidly  suggesting the action of strong selection  Previous work has detected color assortative female preferences in a number of populations suggesting the potential for behavioral isolation among morphs  However  a number of factors may influence the extent to which divergent preferences  which are often measured under controlled laboratory conditions  are expressed in the form of a pattern of assortative mating in nature  We asked  for O  pumilio populations where coloration is polymorphic  whether assortative female preferences lead to a pattern of assortative mating and behavioral reproductive isolation  Our results provide new insights into the role of sexual selection in generating reproductive isolation in this system and highlight the need for a clearer understanding of the conditions under which divergent mate preferences can be expected to translate to behavioral isolation in nature  
Snake genomes provide insight into the molecular evolutionary origins of a phenotypically distinct vertebrate clade  Snakes possess many extreme and unique morphological and physiological adaptations that make them among the fundamentally different among amniote vertebrates  The uniqueness of the form and function of snakes motivates the analysis of how evolution has uniquely shaped snake genomes  and how these genomic changes have led to the unique physical characteristics and adaptations of snakes  Here we link major evolutionary shifts in metabolic protein function to extreme feats of metabolism and physiology observed in snakes  We describe evidence that snake genomes have undergone unprecedented levels of positive selection to change protein function  and the genes identified as targets of selection seem clearly related to the evolution of snake specific characteristics  The structure and evolution of snake genomes  on the whole  are shown to be unique among vertebrates  which indicates snakes are an exciting and valuable model system studying the detailed interactions of multiple inter related genomic attributes and features  e g   epigenetics  transposable elements  mutation rates  recombination  etc    These findings collectively provide new evidence for the diversity of evolutionary genomic changes that may underlie major phenotypic evolutionary shifts in vertebrates  
Genetic and environmental contributions to a divergent plumage trait in barn swallows  A central theme of evolutionary research is to understand the source and function of phenotypic variation  For most phenotypic traits  sources of variation can be partitioned into genetic or environmental variation  Identifying the proportion of variance due to these components allows for predictions regarding phenotypic responses to variable environments and selection to be made  Barn swallow subspecies  Hirundo rustica  have divergent phenotypes and it appears that the focal trait for female preferences has also diverged  We examined at the sources of phenotypic variation of melanin based ventral plumage in two populations of barn swallows  North America  Colorado  H r  erythrogaster  and Europe  Czech Republic  H r  rustica   In North America  male coloration is the target of sexual selection with darker males achieving higher reproductive success  However  it is unclear what role coloration plays in mate choice decision for our study population in the Czech Republic  In both populations  we found that coloration is explained by both genetic and environmental variation  The relative proportions of these sources of phenotypic variation may provide insight into how selection on plumage coloration has differed in these two phenotypically divergent populations and whether divergent sexual selection has contributed to divergence in phenotype  
Use of principal component analysis in species delimitation leads to  precise   underestimation of species numbers  Many species are delimited on the basis of discontinuities  i e   gaps  in patterns of morphological variation  Recently developed Gaussian clustering methods are being increasingly used to discover these morphological gaps objectively  Systematists commonly perform Gaussian clustering after reducing the dimensionality of multivariate morphological space using ordination techniques such as principal component analysis  PCA   Based on statistical principles and biological reasoning  we predicted that this use of PCA leads to underestimation of species numbers  because the main axes of variation defined through PCA are likely unrelated to the morphological dimensions along which morphologically distinct species can be detected  We further predicted that the use of PCA increases the precision  i e   repeatability  of estimates of species numbers  because it reduces the number of parameters involved in species delimitation  We tested these predictions using computer simulation experiments in which two morphologically distinct species were sampled to obtain morphological measurements that were analyzed with Gaussian clustering  We used three experimental treatments previous to Gaussian clustering   1  reduction of dimensionality of morphological space using PCA   2  reduction of dimensionality of morphological space using PCA based on robust covariance estimates  and  3  no reduction of dimensionality  As expected  estimates of the number of species based on reduced morphological space  experimental treatments 1 and 2  were more negatively biased than those based on the original unreduced morphological space  experimental treatment 3   However  contrary to predictions  estimates of the number of species based on reduced morphological space were not more precise  repeatable  than those based on unreduced morphological space  These results question the common use of PCA in species delimitation studies  
Phylogeography and systematics of the southern redback salamander Plethodon serratus in the southeastern US  Studies have shown that historical barriers to gene flow  climate  and habitat play a critical role in maintaining observed patterns of genetic variation in the southeastern United States  The southern redback salamander  Plethodon serratus  is distributed in four disjunct regions in the Southeast  the Ozark  Ouachita  and Appalachian Mountains  and two parishes in Louisiana  We use genetic data and ecological niche modeling to describe the genetic structure within P  serratus and examine shifts in its geographic distribution through time in association with climate  with the ultimate goal of increasing our understanding of the evolutionary processes underlying amphibian geographic distributions in the Southeast  Mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data indicate that while the Appalachian and Ozark regions are each monophyletic  the Ouachita and Louisiana regions are not  Population structure analyses show a pattern consistent with recent gene flow among populations  further supporting the hypothesis that the four regions were recently more contiguous  In contrast to the numerous studies across many taxa supporting expansion of a species from glacial refugia  ecological niche and paleodistribution modeling for P  serratus suggest that its geographic range was likely much broader and more contiguous during the last glacial maximum  21 000 YBP  and has been restricted to its current distribution by a changing climate  Future work on this project will incorporate a large multilocus data set to generate a more robust phylogeny and estimate historical demographic parameters to further shed light on the evolutionary history of this species  
 Do interpopulation crosses and genetic drift disrupt sex determination in Tigriopus californicus  a species with polygenic sex determination    Theory predicts that polygenic sex determination  PSD  should be unstable  it should be easily disrupted by the invasion of novel sex determining and or sexual conflict alleles  thereby providing a route of evolution from polygenic to chromosomal sex determination  CSD   One simple but elegant way this might happen would be through the hybridization of divergent lineages segregating different sets of sex determination alleles  Hybridization here would be predicted to lead to a short term increase in family sex ratio variance  but might be expected to lead to the emergence of a single  dominant sex determiner  and thus  a reduction in family sex ratio variance  over longer timescales  especially if the hybridization event was associated with a reduction in effective population size  However  despite the recent documentation of PSD in an increasing number of species  the role hybridization might play in PSD to CSD transitions remains largely unexamined  With a wide distribution  Baja California to Alaska   high interpopulation divergence  up to 27  at mtCOI   and a short generation time   1 month   the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus is poised to provide insight into how PSD is maintained over time and how PSD might respond to the introduction of novel sex determining alleles via hybridization  We constructed a series of interpopulation crosses between inbred lines and measured survivorship and family sex ratios  Hybrids demonstrated increased variance in family sex ratios that was sometimes  but not always  accompanied by sex biased mortality  Though this sex specific mortality cannot be attributed to Haldane s rule  it may be a manifestation of the genetic discord caused by introducing novel sex influencing alleles through hybridization  We also conducted population diagnostic genotyping of a freely admixing laboratory population  comprised of an equal initial input of two highly divergent natural populations   The maintenance of heterozygosity across a single chromosome in females  but not males  suggests a putative transition to CSD in this hybrid swarm  We therefore measured family sex ratios and survivorship in the swarm and its wild source populations  If the hybrid population has transitioned to CSD  we would expect to see a reduction in the variance in family sex ratios  The sequencing of the hybrid swarm and wild source populations will provide detailed insight into the genetic mechanism of sex determination in each and into how sex determination mechanisms are perturbed by hybridization  
Transcriptome analyses and differential gene expression in the cone snail Conus miliaris  Effects of  predator prey interactions on venom evolution   Species interactions represent fundamental ecological processes that can have significant impacts on the evolutionary trajectories of species  However  the contribution of predator prey interactions to genetic and phenotypic divergence within and between species remains largely unknown  In this context  predatory marine snails of the genus Conus exhibit considerable variation in venom composition  a phenomenon that may be due to the evolution of conotoxins in response to predator prey interactions  It has been hypothesized that geographic differences in prey utilization drive the evolution of conotoxnis in cone snails and that the diversity of conotoxins is positively associated with prey diversity  To test if differences in predatory prey interactions are associated with differences in venom composition  we sequenced and compared venom duct transcriptomes from 22 individuals of Conus miliaris from three geographic populations differing in dietary breath  Preliminary analyses resulted in a reference transcriptome of  28 000 annotated transcripts  including >700 transcripts representing known or suspected venom peptides  Differential expression analyses revealed a total 4 729 differentially expressed transcripts between individuals of C  miliaris  When analyzed as a whole  individuals did not cluster according to populations  However  when only toxin transcripts were analyzed  samples clustered according to populations diets  suggesting functional differences in the venom composition of these populations  
Patterns of genetic variation among Blackcaps  Sylvia atricapilla  with diverse migratory behaviors in Europe  Migratory divides are thought to facilitate behavioral  ecological  and genetic divergence among populations with different migratory routes  However  it is currently contentious how much genetic divergence is needed to maintain distinct migratory behavior across migratory divides  We investigate patterns of neutral genetic differentiation among Blackcap  Sylvia atricapilla  populations with different migratory strategies across Europe  We compare the level of neutral genetic divergence of populations migrating to southwestern  SW  or southeastern  SE  wintering areas with birds wintering in the British Isles following a recently established northwesterly  NW  migration route  The migratory divide between SW and SE wintering areas can be interpreted as a result of a re colonization process after the last glaciation  Thus we predicted greater levels of genetic differentiation among the SW SE populations  However  a lack of genetic differentiation was found between SW and SE populations  suggesting that interbreeding likely occurs among Blackcaps with different migratory orientations across a large area  therefore the SW SE migratory divide can be seen as diffuse  broad band and is  at best  a weak isolating barrier  Conversely  weak  albeit significant genetic differentiation was evident between NW and SW migrants breeding sympatrically in southern Germany  suggesting a stronger isolating mechanism may be acting in this population  Populations located within near the SW SE contact zone were the least genetically divergent from NW migrants  confirming NW migrants likely originated from within the contact zone  Significant isolation by distance was found among eastern Blackcap populations  i e  SE migrants   but not among western populations  i e  NW and SW migrants   revealing different patterns of genetic divergence among Blackcap populations in Europe    We additionally investigated a candidate locus associated with migratory behavior  ADCYAP1   The relationships between genetic variation at this locus  wing morphology and spring migratory phenology were explored among several wild Blackcap populations and within a single  large population in Freiburg  Germany  Additionally  sex effects were investigated at these traits in association with migratory behavior  Overall  birds heterozygous at this locus had earlier spring phenologies across Europe  Males with longer allele sizes were found to have earlier spring phenologies  both among populations and within the single Freiburg population  A significant female specific effect indicates an interaction between and ADCYAP1 allele size and wing shape  suggesting different genotype phenotype combinations may similarly contribute to early spring phenology and thus arrival to breeding grounds  both across Europe and also within a single population   
 Plant mating systems  ecological interactions and the evolution of floral scent   Mating systems are highly variable in plants   The range of this variation  from outcrossing to inbreeding  can dictate interactions with both mutualists  pollinators  but also antagonists  herbivores   and these ecological interactions should in turn drive the evolution of a wide range of phenotypes  from defence to floral traits   However the evolution of plant herbivore pollinator interactions remains poorly understood   We present results of a field study that manipulated herbivory  pollination and mating system in a factorial design  using wild tomato species  Solanaceae  with variable mating systems  We predicted divergent fitness costs of herbivory between outcrossing and selfing populations due to a lack of reproductive assurance in obligate outcrossers  We also predicted that these differential costs would be associated with the evolution of mating system dependent volatile emission from flowers  As predicted  repeated transitions from self incompatibility  obligate outcrossing  to a self compatible mating system were associated with the evolution of reduced floral scent diversity and emission  and also drove the evolution of divergent regulation of volatile chemistry under damage   Scent evolution was consistent with the differential fitness costs of herbivory between mating systems  since these costs were largely mediated by reductions in pollination under herbivore damage  A second study of floral scent evolution across a phylogeny of 21 species of wild potato  Solanaceae  confirmed that mating system transitions have shaped the evolution of floral traits  and the regulation of floral trait expression when plants experience herbivory  Our results suggest that mating systems may play a significant role in herbivore  and pollinator mediated selection on floral phenotypes  and suggest a novel role of herbivores for the evolution of volatile mediated outcrossing  
The genetic architecture of natural variation in abdominal pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster females  Pigmentation varies within and between species and is often an adaptive trait crucial for fitness  It is also a relatively simple morphological trait which serves as a model for mapping the genetic basis of complex traits  We measured natural variation in female abdominal pigmentation in 175 sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel  derived from the Raleigh  NC population  Females were scored for the proportion of melanization on two abdominal segments  tergite 5 and tergite 6  There is significant genetic variation in the proportion of melanization and high broad sense heritability for each tergite  Our genome wide association studies identified 84 genetic variants and 34 SNPs associated with the proportion of melanization on tergite 5 and tergite 6  respectively  There were SNPs associated with the genes tan  ebony  and bric a brac1  all of which are known to affect variation in D  melanogaster abdominal pigmentation  these results provide a proof of principle for genome wide association analyses using the DGRP  Mutant and RNAi knockdown studies demonstrated that 19 of the 30 candidate genes tested  63   have significant effects on the pigmentation of tergite 5  tergite 6  or both  Several of these genes are involved in chitin production  cuticle structure  and vesicle formation and transport  These findings show that genes directly involved with the biosynthesis of the cuticle and melanin and other tyrosine derivatives  as well as genes with pleiotropic effects contribute to natural variation in abdominal pigmentation in D  melanogaster females  
PHYLOGENETIC POSITION OF THE ENIGMATIC ORDER PALMOPHYLLALES  CHLOROPHYTA   INDEPENDENT EVOLUTION OF MULTICELLULARITY IN DEEP WATER  Within Chlorophyta multicellularity has evolved several times independently  Outside the core Chlorophyta  only Palmophyllales is known to form multicellular thalli  which includes three poorly known genera that occur in deep water and other dimly lit  benthic marine habitats  Members of Palmophyllales have traditionally been allied with other similar palmelloid taxa in the core Chlorophyta  Unexpectedly  a molecular phylogenetic study provided evidence that the group formed an early diverging lineage of green algae  The precise phylogenetic position  however  could not be determined with certainty  A recent study on plastid genomes highlighted that ancient gene paralogy may mislead phylogeny inference  and recommended the use of phylogenetic markers that existed in single copy prior to primary cyanobacterial endosymbiosis to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships for the tree of plastids  Phylogenetic analyses based on a draft genome assembly of Verdigellas peltata and a multigene partitioned Bayesian analysis  including chloroplast single copy orthologous genes and rbcL  as well as 18S nrDNA  placed Verdigellas as sister to both Streptophyta and Chlorophyta  These results indicate that Palmophyllales might be the earliest branching lineage of the green plants and  therefore  may have implications for our understanding of the early morphological evolution of Viridiplantae    
Using DNA Sequencing to Assess the Geographic Origin and Coevolutionary Dynamics of an Obligate Brood Parasitic Finch  Vidua macroura   Co invasion  host parasite coevolution  and contingency are all presumed to play roles in the successful human facilitated introduction of obligate avian brood parasites  which lay their eggs in nests of other bird species   and their hosts  to novel and disjunct distributions   The Pin tailed Whydah Vidua macroura is an African endemic  with recently established exotic breeding populations within two of the world s biodiversity hotspots  on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico  and in Southern California  where suitable  estrildid finch host species had been previously established  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the introduced populations of V  macroura may have the ability to successfully switch to novel  non African estrildid hosts in these introduced ranges  Previous  single locus mitochondrial molecular evidence  based on limited sampling  points to a split between western and southern African V  macroura populations   We are conducting a multi locus phylogeographic analysis of native and introduced V  macroura populations  and expand on previous research to sample a wider distribution of museum specimens from across their endemic African distribution  as well as present the first molecular analysis of V  macroura specimens collected from their introduced New World distribution and from captive populations in the USA   Our preliminary analyses provide corroboration for a western African   southern African split and suggest that the California population of V  macroura maps to a western African origin    Characterization of parasite population dynamics across their introduced range serves as a foundation for tests of the relative roles of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the establishment of these new populations  Our plan of study will provide further insight into the adaptive process resulting from recent vicariant events and will help in the development of models to test predictions about the host switching potential and invasion potential of V  macroura in other introduced localities  The ability to make predictions about these birds  invasive potential and host switching potential may mitigate the potentially negative environmental and economic impact such invasions can cause and will inform management and conservation decisions regarding these feral populations   
Sperm do not evolve to collaborate in female meiotic drive  The harmony of the organism is upset during meiosis  a time when alternative alleles compete for representation in successful gametes  During female meiosis this competition is particularly stark as only one of the four products of meiosis are included in the egg   Numerous features of oogenesis appear to have evolved to minimize the potential for conflict  It is therefore surprising that by requiring fertilization before female meiosis is complete  females allow a complete stranger     a haploid sperm genome  to influence the outcome of female meiosis  While in principle this could be disastrous  we evaluate numerous population genetic models in which sperm could influence the outcome of female meiotic drive  and show that sperm evolve to increase fairness of female meiosis and the fitness of resultant progeny   
Strong natural selection on juveniles maintains a narrow adult hybrid zone in a broadcast spawner  Natural selection can maintain and help form species boundaries across different habitats  even when dispersal among habitats is high  Selection against inferior migrants  immigrant inviability  acts when locally adapted populations suffer high mortality upon dispersal to unsuitable habitats  Populations undergoing divergent selection via immigrant inviability should thus show  1  a change in the ratio of adapted to non adapted individuals among age size classes and 2  a genetic cline  defined by the environmental gradient  as selection counterbalances migration  Here we examine the frequencies of two depth segregated lineages in juveniles and adults of the long lived Caribbean octocoral Eunicea flexuosa  which has larvae that disperse over spatial scales orders of magnitude greater than the distances separating the co occurring types  We found that distributions of the two lineages in both shallow and deep environments are more distinct when inferred from adults  > 50 cm  than from juveniles   
Cryptic phyloendemism across the vast monsoonal tropics of northern Australia  Phylogeographic analyses commonly reveal deeply divergent but morphologically cryptic lineages within species  a layer of diversity invisible to traditional morphology based taxonomy  North Australia is dominated by an extensive and relatively intact tropical savanna biome  across which the true diversity is poorly explored  Phylogeographic analyses of low dispersal lizards  from mtDNA to genome scale  indicate that the diversity and endemism of the region has been vastly underestimated   Revealing the true hotspots of endemism across the region will help prioritise and support large scale ecological management and development of indigenous controlled protected areas  
An Investigation of Bacterial and Fungal Symbionts of the Planthoppers  Hemiptera  Fulgoroidea   Planthoppers  Hemiptera  Fulgoroidea  are a diverse superfamily of phytophagous insects with more than 14 000 species in 21 families described worldwide  Planthoppers  and other lineages within the hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhyncha  are unusual in that they appear to house a variety of multi species assemblages of endosymbionts    a condition that has been described as a   hunger for symbionts    Although these symbiotic associations have been examined in other auchenorrhynchan lineages  planthopper symbionts have remained largely unexplored and uncharacterized  Using capillary sequencing as well as metagenomics deep sequencing of regions of 16S and 18S rDNA  we surveyed exemplars of 18 planthopper families to identify planthopper associated bacteria and fungi  We present these results in the context of our reconstructed planthopper phylogeny  allowing us to interpret symbiont co occurrences  losses  and replacements in light of known evolutionary patterns of host plant usage  
Non null effects of a null range  Exploring parameter estimation in the dispersal extinction cladogenesis model  Parametric models in historical biogeography that integrate geographic ranges and phylogenies have shown to be extremely informative in understanding the geographic range evolution of taxa  One such approach is the dispersal extinction cladogenesis  DEC  model  which has been widely used in empirical analyses of the evolution of geographic range using discrete area states  However  local extinction rates are difficult to estimate well in this model  We explore the cause of this as well as a potential solution  
What ion channel gene duplications can tell us about the origin s  of the nervous system  Animals are the only multicellular lineage to have nervous systems  suggesting that the evolution of complex electrical signaling was an extremely unlikely event  However  recent phylogenetic data supports the idea that the nervous system  or at least complex nervous systems  may have evolved several times in the animal lineage  To what extent are the nervous systems of extant animals convergent  The profusion of genomic data allows us to compare the genetic complements of extant animals and infer what genes were present in ancestral lineages  We have previously shown that the genes which cause action potentials in nerve and muscle  the voltage gated sodium channels  have an ancient origin  and that key molecular and biophysical changes occurred convergently in multiple animal phyla which suggest multiple origins of complex nervous systems  Liebeskind et al  2011   But extant nervous systems rely on many different ion channel types for their complexity  Here  we use a gene tree species tree reconciliation approach to illustrate the evolutionary history of the main ion channel gene families that power the nervous system  We find broad support for the idea that complex nervous systems arose independently in multiple animal lineages  Interestingly  however  the gene families with the largest independent radiations tend to be those that shape  rather than create action potentials  This suggests that the common ancestor of extant animals was capable of simple electrical impulses  and that the retention of a core set of ion channel genes set the stage for the convergent evolution of complexity  Thus we favor a more gradual scenario of parallel evolution rather than a model of convergent evolution of nervous systems de novo  This gradualist model best explains the patterns we see today and helps clarify one of the most remarkable achievements of the evolutionary process  
The Genetics of Divergence Between Upland and Lowland Ecotypes of Panicum virgatum  Panicum virgatum  switchgrass  is an outcrossing C4 perennial grass native to most of North America  Wild populations are predominantly found in tall grass prairie and agronomic cultivars are being developed as a feedstock for cellulosic bioethanol  Because of its economic importance  there is interest in developing genomic tools for marker assisted breeding programs and crop development  However there is abundant natural variation in Panicum virgatum that lends itself well to the study local adaptation  Two predominant ecotypes are found in overlapping ranges across the Midwestern United States  The northern upland ecotype is adapted to colder climates and shorter growing seasons  whereas the lowland ecotype is found in riparian areas and has a longer growing season  We have developed a 4 way outbred mapping population of 400 individuals that captures the variation observed between upland and lowland ecotypes to study the underlying genetic architecture of locally adaptive traits  Genetic markers were developed using a double digest RAD scheme and assembled using both a reference based and de novo approach  The population is currently growing in Austin  Texas but will be clonally propagated and planted at several sites spanning a latitudinal gradient across the Midwest  Thus far we have created a linkage map and found many QTL associated with traits measured in the initial field season  In future years we will compare QTL across environments to discover loci underlying trait divergence between locally adapted ecotypes  
 MIGRATE 4 0  many loci  divergences  and assignments   New development of the Bayesian inference program MIGRATE  version 4 0  http   popgen sc fsu edu  extend the available population models to divergence time estimation among populations  The new divergence model can handle situations that require an indpendent ancestral population and also situations where one of the sampled populations is also ancestral  resulting in models with fewer parameters  All models  migration  divergence  can be mixed and can be compared and ordered according to the marginal likelihood  Additionally  an assignment module was added  This module allows probabilistic assignment of individuals with unknown population labels  The assignment is model based and integrated with the other models available in MIGRATE  it assumes a particular migration divergence model of which some or most individuals have known population labels  Such assignment problems arise  for example   when we want to calculate the assignment probability of invasive species to known native populations    
Metagenomic analysis of a ssDNA viral community  Every organism has at least one virus capable of infecting it  yet our knowledge of the Earths virome is extremely limited  The development of high throughput sequencing has made it possible to examine the community composition of viruses at a depth that was not previously possible  It is important that we increase our knowledge of the single  stranded DNA  ssDNA  viral group as it contains agricultural pathogens  such as porcine circoviruses and cotton leaf curl viruses  and Microviridae  a family of viruses that is often used as a model system in experimental evolution studies  This study utilized size selection and Illumina MiSeq sequencing to analyze the genetic diversity of a community of circular ssDNA viruses from a wastewater treatment plant  Wastewater treatment plants can be seen as a reservoir for viruses  and by studying the diversity of viruses present in them we can learn about potential agricultural pathogens in the area  All of the genomes analyzed were found to be genetically distinct from any known virus  with all of them sharing  identity with their closest match on GenBank  Of the 66 Circoviridae and Geminiviridae genomes examined  six were found to be mosaics of both families  44 had one gene which could not be classified  and only 16 could be definitively classified as solely belonging to one of these families  Surprisingly  no Microvirinae were found and all Microviridae genomes belonged to the subfamily Gokushovirinae  Ongoing temporal sampling will aid our understanding of whether this population is stable or continually variable and the breadth of mutations allowable in these groups  
Global biogeography of mating system variation in seed plants  Mating systems are among the most labile features of seed plants  with frequent evolutionary transitions across the spectrum from outcrossing to selfing  Previous work has shown strong associations between mating system variation and life history and vegetative growth form  Less is understood about the biogeography of mating system variation despite considerable speculation in the literature  For example  it has been argued that stronger biotic interactions at lower latitudes are associated with a higher frequency of outcrossers compared to high latitudes  Alternatively  it has been argued that latitudinal variation in the frequency of mating systems may simply arise as a by product of geographic variation in the frequency of life history and growth form strategies  We examined the biogeography of mating system variation in seed plants using a global database of outcrossing rate estimates from 624 published studies of 492 taxa  We tested for an association between outcrossing rate and latitude  biome  life history  and growth form  We conducted analyses that accounted for phylogeny  in part  because we detected significant phylogenetic signal in our dataset  Consistent with previous analyses of a subset of this dataset  we found that life history and growth form were the strongest predictors of mating system variation  When examined alone  latitude was significantly associated with variation in outcrossing rates  however  this relationship was not apparent when phylogeny was taken into account  Similarly  when either life history or growth form was accounted for  we did not detect any geographic patterns to mating system variation  Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that biogeographic patterns of mating system variation are best explained by spatial patterns in the frequency of vegetative forms and life history strategies rather than by variation in biotic environments   
Accurate detection of mutations from short read sequencing data  Spontaneous mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic diversity  The rate  fitness distribution and directional biases present in newly arising mutations are fundamental paramaters in theoretical evolutionary genetics  The rate of deleterious mutation has obvious relevance to the study of human disease  and is also a key parameter in models of conservation in small populations  the evolution and maintenance of sexual recombination and the evolution of aging  Mutation bias contributes to patterns of genomic evolution and the mutation rate is a key demographic parameter  and a labile evolutionary trait in its own right  Determining the values of these important parameters in practice is difficult  Mutation accumulation experiments require completely relaxing the effects of natural selection  which is both a technically challenging and laborious process  Detecting mutations from genetic data associated with these experiments is also difficult  Modern high throughput sequencing methods make the generation of whole genome data possible  However  the high per base mutation rates of these methods  combined with biases in library perpetration and sequence assembly  mean typical approaches to variant detection produce many false positives  The ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila provides an almost perfect model for the study of spontanaeous mutation  Individuals of this species contain distinct germline and somatic nuclei  During asexual reproduction the genes of the germline nucleus are not expressed  meaning germ line mutations are not exposed to selection  When T  thermophila cultures are maintained in asexual growth otherwise lethal and highly deleterious mutations can accumulate in the germline genome  In order to take advantage of this remarkable system  we have developed a novel approach to detecting spontaneous mutations from short read sequencing data  We model base calls for a given site in an assembly using the Dirichlet multinomial distribution  and sum over all possible genotypes and lineage histories to calculate the probability a site contains a mutation in one line  We are testing this model on a preliminary dataset arising from 10 mutation accumulation lines  These data  along with PCR validation of putative mutations  have allowed us to investigate properties of sequencing data associated with both false negative and false positive mutations calls   Our initial results suggest T  thermophila has a low single nucleotide mutation rate with strong directional biases  
Coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers in the marine blue mussel  genus Mytilus  hybrid zone in central California  A long standing discussion in speciation research has focused on the importance of endogenous  environment independent  pre  or post zygotic genetic incompatibilities versus exogenous  ecologically driven  incompatibilities in maintaining adaptive gene combinations in hybrid zones despite the deteriorating effect of recombination  Recent genomic data has revealed that genomic regions blocked from introgression are also correlated with environmental variables in many hybrid zones  which implies an important role for ecologically driven incompatibilities in maintaining species barriers  Beirne et al   2011  proposed that endogenous incompatibilities are not directly responsible for maintaining species barriers  but instead  coupling of endogenous and exogenous clines has lead to the coincidence of genotype by environment associations  GEA  in regions of the genome blocked from introgression because of linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities  local adaptation genes  and neutral loci  In this study  we use double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing  ddRADseq  to investigate evidence for coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers in the marine blue mussel  genus Mytilus  hybrid zone in California  Our results are consistent with several predictions of Bierne s coupling hypothesis  We find rarity of backcross genotypes consistent with strong endogenous barriers  We also find strong GEAs in north San Francisco Bay  a region of fine grained environmental heterogeneity with high connectivity  but only weak GEAs at isolated localities  Context dependent GEAs in the Mytilus spp hybrid zone is consistent with local emergence of GEAs due to linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities  local adaptation genes and neutral loci rather than by direct ecological selection against loci blocked from introgression  
Phylogeographic analysis of the polytypic Red crowned Ant Tanager Habia rubica  Cardinalidae  at a continental scale  The Neotropics harbor the highest avian diversity of the world  but the study of the processes leading to this accumulation of bird species has gained more attention just during the last two decades  Phylogeographic studies of Neotropical species have been concentrated mainly in the Amazon basin  the Andes mountain range and more recently the Atlantic Forest  but analyses at a continental scale are comparatively rare  In this study we explore the intraspecific diversity of the Red crowned Ant Tanager  Habia rubica   a lowland forest dweller with a fragmented distribution with four major areas  Central America and southeastern Mexico  Pacific  coast of southern Mexico  the Atlantic Forest in eastern South America  and the Yungas Amazonia complex in western South America  This species is one of the most polytypic passerines in the region  with 17 subspecies  but several of these are poorly differentiated and hard to recognize  Here we include nearly 120 tissue samples from 9 countries throughout the species distribution and we perform genetic analyses based in two mitochondrial markers  cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b  and two nuclear loci  one Z linked  intron 9 of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene  and one autosomal  intron 5 of the   fibrinogen gene   We have generated unrooted median joining and statistical parsimony networks  and inferred phylogenies using both Bayesian and maximum parsimony methodologies  The analyses of the mitochondrial markers have shown the existence of four main lineages with deep divergence that match the fragmented areas of the species distribution The deepest split is between the populations of Central America and Mexico from those of South America  despite the existence of a high genetic divergence  6 7  in mitochondrial DNA  both between the two northern clades  Central America southeastern Mexico and Pacific coast of Mexico  and the two South American clades  Atlantic Forest and Yungas Amazonia complex   Preliminary analysis of nuclear markers show less resolution but congruent results  Additionally  we are carrying out complementary studies of behavioral characters  vocalizations   and our preliminary results show the existence of significant differences in both temporal and frequency variables of the song that are consistent with the lineages found in the genetic analyses  We believe that the high divergence found among clades and the presence of differences in vocalizations suggest that a taxonomic revision of this species is needed  The analyses of the obtained patterns could also provide new insights into the history of some of the most overlooked forest habitats of the region  
 Population determinants of persistence  migration  and colonization success in a plant metapopulation   The theory of interconnected populations  metapopulations  has shown that conclusions regarding ecological and evolutionary dynamics derived from single populations can be radically different when considered in a spatial context  However  metapopulation models are often stylized with parameters driving the system  such as migration  extinction  and colonization assumed to remain constant across populations and through time  Evolution in spatially structured populations will likely involve the evolution of the spatial ecology and genetic structure of the system itself  especially if there is inter demic selection and or the rates of migration  extinction  or colonization are genetically determined and subject to evolutionary change  Here we leverage a long term demographic dataset  high resolution genotyping  and a mixture of classical and recently derived statistical genetics to estimate the fundamental parameters of a natural metapopulation of the angiosperm Silene latifolia  but also identify and disentangle the ecological and genetic factors that influence those parameters and hence the evolution and spatial structure of the system  Population genetic structure is pervasive  but quantitatively different across sections of the metapopulation  Among population migration was generally low  with a large variance  New colonists often occurred at distances much greater than the average dispersal distance amongst established populations  Most significantly  we uncovered evidence population determinants of colonization success  as modulated through a disproportionately larger proportion of colonists originating from populations of higher genetic diversity  
Morphological and genetic analyses of interspecific introgression in natural populations of Enallagma damselflies  Species that hybridize in nature can deepen our understanding of how reproductive isolation evolves to give rise to new species   In particular  species in the earliest stages of divergence provide an opportunity to identify reproductive isolating mechanisms that evolve early during speciation    Enallagma damselflies  Odonata  Coenagrionidae  show striking interspecific differences in male and female reproductive structure morphology  and these structural differences contribute to premating reproductive isolation  RI  between species   Enallagma anna and E  carunculatum are sympatric North American damselflies that are thought to hybridize in nature based on reports of males with secondary genitalia that appear to possess morphologies intermediate to those of the parental pure species  We collected 40 male and 32 female putative hybrids from a sympatric population in Whitefish  MT   We use 3D morphometric techniques to quantify the shapes of male and female reproductive structures in putative hybrids and compare their morphologies to the parental species   We also assay gene flow between E  anna and E  carunculatum in the Whitefish population using AFLP markers  and examine the relationship between morphology and introgression of certain markers   These results will verify introgression in the natural population and help facilitate a finer scale mapping study on the genetics of male female morphological coevolution using laboratory reared individuals    
Resolving Intralocus Sexual Conflict  results of a long term selection experiment in Drosophila melanogaster   Intralocus sexual conflict  IASC  occurs due to the expression of sexually antagonistic alleles  those that increase fitness when expressed in one sex  but decrease fitness when expressed in the other sex  This genetic conflict is expected whenever the sexes are selected toward differing phenotypic optima for a trait that has a positive genetic correlation between the sexes  IASC can be resolved  when the intersexual genetic correlation for the trait in question is reduced or eliminated  While IASC has been documented in a wide variety of traits among many taxa  there is little extant data indicating whether this conflict is rapidly resolved  or persists for long periods of evolutionary time  Here we report the results of long term selection experiment in Drosophila melanogaster  where the sexes were antagonistically selected on for body size  males larger  females smaller   Despite ample genetic variation for body size in both sexes  no IASC resolution was observed after 100 generations of selection  indicating that IASC can act as a long term impediment to adaptation  However  after an additional 50 generations of selection  substantial resolution was observed in both the selection lines  although to differing degrees   confirming that resolution was  in fact  possible for this trait  
Target Enrichment of Ultraconserved Elements in Sky Island Frogs of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest  The Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest  BAR  is characterized by a remarkable degree of diversity and endemism  particularly in montane areas  In particular  recent studies have suggested that these areas might have served as climatic refugia during the climatic oscillations of the Quaternary  yet studies to date have mostly focused on few species and loci  this limiting the power to distinguish alternative diversification scenarios  In this study we investigate two co distributed anuran genera   Brachycephalus  Brachycephalidae  and Melanophryniscus  Bufonidae    showing highly restricted populations limited to montane cloud forests in the southern BAR  Genetic variation among populations was assessed using target enrichment of ultraconserved elements  thus providing a highly robust assessment of both species phylogenetic relationships and the level of intrapopulation variability  Our results are consistent with the existence of many highly restricted  and still underscribed  species  some of which limited to a single mountaintop  Moreover  the timing of diversification of both genera is consistent with a common scenario of a climatic shift  trapping  populations into cloud forests  followed by a relative climatic stability that maintained their isolation  The implications of these discoveries to the conservation of microendemic montane species are discussed  
 On the origin of snakes  Inferring the ecology  behavior  and evolutionary history of ancestral snakes   The astounding diversity and disparity of snakes has long inspired debate regarding their evolutionary origin  Here  we present the first comprehensive analytical reconstruction of the ancestor of snakes  incorporating new data from species of less modified basal snakes ranging in age from 105 40 Ma  new information on the anatomy of the stem snake Dinilysia patagonica  and a deeper understanding of the distribution of phenotypic apomorphies among the major clades of fossil and Recent snakes  We further infer a time calibrated divergence tree  which provides novel insight into when  where  and how snakes originated  The major crown group subclade Henophidia first radiated in the Cenozoic around the K Pg Mass Extinction  66 Ma   Although error margins preclude certainty as to whether crown Henophidia initially diverged before or after the K Pg boundary  the widespread distribution and astonishing diversification of henophidian snakes  > 3 000 extant spp   clearly occurred after the mass extinction event  The snake total group diverged much earlier  sometime around 100 Ma  during a burst of radiation that coincides with the so called  Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution   Although the ancestral crown snake is inferred to have originated in Gondwana  the ancestor of the snake total group may have originated on Laurasia  based on the biogeographic distribution of the basalmost stem group snake Coniophis precedens and a succession of other anguimorph outgroups  Both the total group and crown group snake ancestors unambiguously reconstruct as having lived on land  rather than in a marine setting  thus supporting the  terrestrial origin  hypothesis for the origin of snakes  and rejecting the controversial  marine origin  hypothesis  For much of their early evolutionary history  snakes are inferred to have preferred warm  equable  well watered  broad leafed  tropical to subtropical forests  which may account for their surprising absence among the otherwise diverse lizard faunas of the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia  The ancestral snake emerged at night to forage widely for relatively large  soft bodied prey  likely small vertebrates   Constriction  which is often associated with all snakes  did not evolve early in snake history  and the re acquisition of diurnal habits appears to have occurred within crown group Colubroidea  specifically in the clade stemming from the last common ancestor of Elapidae + Colubridae  This reconstruction may explain the clade s success at invading the cooler and drier habitats that emerged at higher latitudes during the latter half of the Miocene  when colder night time temperatures no longer favored the nocturnal snakes of the jungle forest floor  
Inferring Very Recent Population Growth Rate from Population Scale Sequencing Data Using a Large Sample Coalescent Estimator  p  li { white space  pre wrap  }  Large sample or population level sequencing data provides unprecedented opportunities for inferring detailed population histories  especially recent demographic histories  On the other hand  it challenges most existing population genetic methods  simulation based approaches require intensive computation  and analytical approaches are often numerically intractable when the sample size is large  We proposed a computationally efficient method for simultaneous estimation of population size and growth rate in the very recent history  using the pattern of the total number of segregating sites as a function of sample size  TNSFS   Coalescent simulation shows that it can accurately and efficiently estimate the rate and the onset time of the recent population growth from large scale data  This approach has the flexibility to model population history with multiple growth stages or other epochs  and it is robust when the sample size is very large or at the population scale  for which the Kingmans coalescent assumption is not valid  This approach is applied to two recently published data and estimates the recent population growth rate in the European population to be 2 4  with the onset time 5 8Kyr ago  and the rate in the African population to be 1 44  with the onset time 8 5Kyr ago  
Who Are the Fathers  Characterizing Hybrid Origins of Parthenogenetic Aspidoscelis Lizards  Recent advances in genomic subsampling techniques and associated data analysis pipelines now permit interrogating difficult problems in phylogenetics at the population level  Over the last fifty years  conclusive population assignments for North American whiptail lizards  Aspidoscelis  formerly Cnemidophorus  eluded investigators utilizing morphology  skin histocompatibility  karyotypes  and mitochondrial gene trees  Hybridization between several whiptail species complicates phylogenies because female F1 hybrids reproduce independently from males via true parthenogenesis  Typically these hybrids are diploid with one complete set of chromosomes from each  parent  species  Interestingly  primarily clonal parthenogenetic lizards exhibit some phenotypic variation in scalation  size  and color  In one example  six pattern classes A F exist for the parthenogenetic hybrid lizard A  tesselata which was subsequently divided into three species  A  neotesselata  triploid and secondarily hybridized   A  dixoni  diploid with two pattern classes in two small  disjunct populations   and three remaining diploid pattern classes still considered A  tesselata  In this study  I sought to infer lineages within the Aspidoscelis tesselata dixoni complex  I hypothesized multiple hybridization events between the parent species A  marmorata and A  scalaris  cf  A  gularis   To capture the maximal genetic information across multiple   50  individuals per species and across species  I implemented double digest restriction associated DNA sequencing  ddRADseq   ddRADseq captures thousands of homologous unlinked loci between many individuals without reference genomes  Multiplexing and sequencing these loci on the Illumina HiSeq platform allows for inferring single nucleotide polymorphisms to use in many population genetic analyses  I will present preliminary parental population assignments to A  tesselata dixoni inferred using structure in the context of each population s geographic range  Multiple origins of a vertebrate parthenogen would constitute diversity not otherwise expected of a completely clonal lineage from one origin  
The effects of clonal reproduction on the rate of evolution   We develop a model that examines how clonal reproduction affects a population s rate of evolution and amount of evolutionary lag  The types of life history structure typical of ecologically important organisms such as reef building corals and many clonal plant species include modular organization  indeterminate growth  and the existence of both asexual  clonal  and sexual reproduction  Predicting how such organisms will respond to rapid environmental change necessitates an understanding of which specific life history parameters most directly determine the rate of evolution and the amount of maladaptation  We use an extension of a previous population genetic model for the fate of alleles in stage structured diploid populations with clonal and sexual reproduction  Orive 1995  2001  as well as recent theoretical results for evolution in stage structured populations  Barfield et al  2011   which only considered sexual reproduction  Important features of the model developed here include an explicit consideration of the effects of somatic mutations and of the difference between sexual and clonal offspring in the environmental component of phenotype  
Computationally efficient estimation of the number of founders for colonized populations  Inferring the number of founding individuals for a colonized population  or quantifying the founder effect is important for population genetic studies  Existing approaches require intensive computation via simulations when the sample size is large  We adopt some recent theoretical results to improve the computational speed  Given the same computational capacities  the new approach can efficiently handle much larger samples  and has a significantly boosted performance characteristics than the existing methods  Simulation studies demonstrate that increasing sample size can greatly improve both accuracy and precision of the estimates  Therefore  this approach is expected to be useful for molecular ecological and evolutionary studies in the genomic sequencing era  The method is applied to a mtDNA data set with 352 Polynesian individuals  and estimate the number of founders of the Polynesian population to be 53   95  CI  28 7  77 5   at 2500 years ago  The small number of founding individuals during the colonization of the Polynesian populations is consistent with former discovery of a severe founder effect and low genetic diversity in the Polynesian genomes  
Sexual selection and species recognition in Calopteryx damselflies  Traits used in species recognition and traits used in mate choice are thought to be under contrasting selection pressures  as traits under sexual selection within a species should not interfere with signals of species identity  Conflict between these roles can be avoided if different traits act as signals in each case  but here we consider how a single trait may be under selection in both cases  We examined how damselfly wing pigmentation may be used in species recognition in sympatric populations of C  maculata and C  aequabilis  and how it may also be under sexual selection during mate choice within C  maculata  In a mark recapture study of C  maculata  we found that successfully mated males had darker wings  which may be favored in mate choice by females  In caged mating experiments using both species  we tested the role of wing pigmentation in species recognition  using damselflies from allopatric and sympatric populations that show variation in wing pigmentation  We found that wing pigmentation also functioned in species recognition  but in courtship by males  Wing pigmentation is under sexual selection in males and under selection for species recognition in females  A single character  therefore  may be under contrasting selection pressures but not conflict due to sexual dimorphism of that trait  
Evolving virulence and defense in a symbiotic community   Symbiotic organisms are ubiquitous and can be integral to the survival  fitness  and development of their hosts  These relationships are not limited to microbial symbionts and their multicellular hosts  but can be extended to multiple multicellular organisms that rely on each other for resources  protection  or reproduction  Furthermore  interactions between a symbiont and its host are carried out in the context of the community of other symbionts affecting that host  These between symbiont interactions can range from facilitating to excluding other symbionts from the host  From fungi inhabiting plants to bacteria living in our guts  symbionts have been shown to protect their hosts against other  more damaging symbionts  Here we put forth a model which examines the evolution of two traits in a symbiont  First  the effect of a symbiont on host mortality  and second  the effect of a symbiont on other symbionts interacting with a host  We make three key assumptions in this model  First  we assume that symbionts receive a reproductive payoff for harming their host  This tradeoff leads to an evolutionary stable level of virulence  Second  we assume that symbionts coinfecting a host share the costs of each other virulence  These shares costs can cause the evolutionary stable level of virulence to increase  Third  we assume that in defending a host a symbiont pays a reproductive cost while decreasing the impact of the shared costs of virulence on themselves  Together these three assumptions allow for the coevolution of two traits  virulence and defense  in multiple species of symbionts infecting the same host species  The terms  defensive  and  mutualist  are often used synonymously  however examples exist of symbionts that inflict a high toll on the hosts they defend  Thus we pose the question  If virulence and defense are independent traits  does defense necessarily lead to mutualism  Additionally  we examine the role that defense plays in the stability of evolutionary stable levels of virulence when the levels of coinfection vary  We show that  while the evolution of defense does not necessarily lead to mutualism  defensive traits can temper selection for increased virulence due to multiple infections  This model shows that virulence and defense of the host must be looked at as two separate traits  and that defense can be a powerful moderator of virulence in a symbiotic community  
Experimental evolution to domesticate a filamentous multicellular fungus yields diverse novel phenotypes  Experimental evolution to domesticate a filamentous multicellular fungus yields diverse novel phenotypes Alexis F  L  A  Powell1  Hui Lin1  Romas J  Kazlauskas1 2  and Michael Travisano1 3  1BioTechnology Institute  2Department of Biochemistry  Molecular Biology  and Biophysics  and 3Department of Ecology  Evolution  and Behavior  University of Minnesota  St  Paul  MN 55108  Domesticated organisms exhibit many traits unknown in their wild ancestors  Plant and animal domestication is generally thought to be governed by strong artificial selection on a few high value traits  accompanied by release of many formerly functional traits from natural selection  Both sets of traits may evolve to unusual states that are hallmarks of domestication  By contrast  accounts of microbial domestication do not give attention to evolution of nonadaptive traits  and some studies have found that domesticated microbes do not show the genomic signatures of relaxation of selection or population bottlenecks that typify domesticated plants and animals  We used experimental evolution to domesticate the filamentous fungus Trichoderma citrinoviride by subjecting replicate populations to a culturing protocol with > 200 serial transfers designed to favor evolution of rapid growth in agitated liquid with suspended insoluble cellulose media  high production of extracellular cellulosic enzymes  and easy transferability via micropipette  Evolved populations were plated on malt extract agar media to study aspects of their aggregate growth and morphology  We found substantial phenotypic variation among lineages  including novel phenotypes not known from the wild type ancestor  Our results suggest that the evolutionary consequences of domestication for this filamentous microbe are not unlike those seen in plants and animals  These results also suggest that other Trichoderma species  which exhibit little morphological variation despite occupying a wide range of habitats and employing different nutritional modes  saprotrophy and mycoparasitism   likely have latent potential for similar evolution but are ecologically constrained by factors not relevant in the domestic environment  
Regulatory adaptation is linked to global gene expression changes in human evolution  Courtney C  Babbitt1 2  Ralph Haygood1  Lisa W  Pfefferle1  Olivier Fedrigo1 2  and Gregory A  Wray1 2 3 1  Department of Biology  Duke University 2  Institute for Genome Sciences   Policy  Duke University 3  Department of Evolutionary Anthropology  Duke University  There are many dramatic phenotypic differences between humans and non human primates distributed across many tissue types  In order to understand the ways in which gene expression has required trade offs across multiple tissues we used RNA Seq to assay gene expression between humans  chimpanzees  and macaques in matched samples from frontal cortex  cerebellum  liver  white adipose  and skeletal muscle  We found a slightly negative correlation with evidence of adaptation in coding regions and changes in gene expression  However  we found a significant correlation between categories of genes that show evidence of adaptation in regulatory regions  including both promoters and distal enhancers  and differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees  There is also evidence that many genes are not under significant constraint across tissues  thereby allowing the expression of these genes to evolve rapidly  Across all tissues  the gene ontology categories that are highly differentially expressed include neural processes  metabolism  development  and signaling  and many of these changes are specific to the human lineage  Significant gene expression changes between humans and chimpanzees are also enriched for genes associated with late onset diseases prevalent in humans such as insulin signaling and epithelial cancers  Collectively  these results suggest that regulatory adaptations that changed gene expression during human evolution may have also had knock on effects that increase our susceptibility to certain late onset diseases  
 Adapterama @ BadDNA org   DNA sequencing sample prep for Illumina instruments made easy  amplicons  RADseq  sequence capture   genomes    Next generation DNA sequencing  NGS  presents a potential cornucopia of benefits for studies in evolutionary biology  but easy low cost preparation of many samples for sequencing remains a constraint   In Adapterama  we present methods for preparing many uniquely tagged  indexed  samples for NGS   Although many sample preparation methods exist  most of these methods rely upon a limited number of commercially available adapters or require single purpose  custom adapters that require substantial initial investment  e g   thousands of dollars of oligos to facilitate pooling dozens to hundreds of samples   We demonstrate cheap combinatorial methods to create double   triple   and quadruple indexed samples that can be pooled   sequenced with standard Illumina libraries to produce high quality reads for mitochondrial and genome assemblies  microsatellite identification  sequence capture  amplicon sequencing and restriction digest libraries in as many combinations as one desires   The result is that sequencing for many projects in evolutionary biology can be achieved by using these methods  and that the sequencing costs for many projects can become so trivial that being nice to your colleagues can replace the need for everyone winning the grant lottery  
Genomic consequences of introgressive hybridization in Darwin s Finches adaptive radiation  Hybridizing species complexes provide one of the richest natural experiments in evolutionary biology  Interspecific hybridization can break up co adapted genes  disrupt local adaptation and produce genomic extinction  But it could also be viewed as a creative force behind species formation  particularly at differing levels of gene flow in a so called   mosaic of speciation    Here we explore the genomic consequences of introgressive hybridization in a hybridizing complex of closely related Darwin ground Finches  We identified more than 41 000 SNPs across the three sympatric species of ground finches  Geospiza fuliginosa  G  fortis  G  magnirostris   including the two distinct fortis morphs  We found that despite high levels of gene flow across all species  we could detect  600 species specific SNPs associated to  conventional  morphological categories  but no association was found when these SNPs where chosen randomly  These findings suggest genetic permeability across  porous  species boundaries where neutral loci can move freely but putative naturally selected loci get trapped  We suggest the importance of species bridges in creating and maintaining species identities and stress the important role of introgressive hybridization behind the radiation of Darwin s Finches  
Conserving genomic variability in amphibians  estimating effective population size and population growth trends  Recent advancements in genetic techniques now make it possible for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  to be assayed across the genomes of non model species  Because accuracy and precision in estimating effective population size  Ne  and genetic diversity increases rapidly with the number of loci used  this could lead to powerful studies of population health and viability  However  before these estimates can be applied to conservation questions  it is necessary to understand the evolutionary processes and mechanisms regulating genetic diversity  Ne and other measures of genetic diversity can be used to detect changes in population abundance and identify conservation needs  However  calculating Ne requires restrictive assumptions about population processes such as stable population size  no age structure  and no gene flow  Amphibians have complex population structuring  violating many of the assumptions in models used to estimate Ne  It is unclear what the true Ne is under these circumstances because current equations do not take into account all factors simultaneously  We use stochastic population simulation models under representative demographic conditions to estimate true Ne and quantify genetic diversity loss  We evaluated model results with empirical data  using both demographic and genetic methods to estimate Ne in two populations of salamanders  Ambystoma opacum and A  talpoideum in an isolated wetland  on the Savannah River Site  SC  over a 20 yr period  These two species represent opposite growth rate trends  with A  opacum population steadily expanding over the course of the study and A  talpoideum declining  The numbers of breeding adults  N  and their offspring are known for 30 years for each population  To calculate Ne with demographic models we used field estimates of longevity  sex ratio  generation time  and breeding success  For genetic estimates we used double digest RAD sequencing to generate several thousand SNP markers to estimate Ne and other classical population genetic parameters  Ho  HE  allelic richness  using temporally collected genetic data over 20 years for each species  Our results provide important information on what factors should be incorporated into models for estimating Ne    
Billion year old rate shifts in microbial evolution  Phylogenetic comparative methods are increasingly being applied to large scale phylogenies to give novel insights into the history of life  Here we apply these methods to extend our knowledge into deep time by studying trait evolution across microbial phylogenies that span billion year timescales  We examine patterns of trait evolution and covariation across the phylogenies of archaea and cyanobacteria  Furthermore  we employ methods that estimate the location of shifts in evolutionary rates across a suite of metabolic  ecological and morphological traits  We then test whether estimated rate shifts in trait evolution correspond to major events in the history of earth  such as the Great and Secondary Oxygenation events  Our work represents a collaboration between the Next Generation Phenomics and Arbor working groups as part of the assembling  analyzing and visualizing the tree of life  AVAToL  program  Data are collected using novel software tools for the construction of phenomic character matrices for microbial taxa   We then use these data as a test case for the development of the Arbor software package  which is a scalable  web services based platform for conducting phylogenetic comparative analyses  We demonstrate how these software tools enable the collection of large scale phenomic datasets that can then be flexibly and reproducibly analyzed on phylogenetic trees to test evolutionary hypotheses  
An evolutionarily conserved epigenetic element converts wild fungi from metabolic specialists to generalists   GAR+  is a protein based element of inheritance that allows yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to circumvent a normal hallmark of their biology  extreme metabolic specialization for glucose fermentation  When glucose is present  even in trace quantities  yeast will not use other carbon sources   GAR+  allows cells to circumvent this   glucose repression      When  GAR+  appears spontaneously  it allows a small fraction of a yeast population to   hedge its bets   by evading glucose repression   We find these de novo rates correlate with the yeasts ecological niche   Evolutionarily distant fungi also possess similar epigenetic elements  and many of the proteins involved in the  GAR+  phenotype show significant homology across these evolutionary distances   Furthermore  population genetic modeling based on these experimental data support an inference that the bet hedging characteristics of  GAR+  may be under selection  suggesting that it may be a broadly conserved adaptive strategy  
Life history selection drives the early evolution of reproductive barriers in Mimulus guttatus  A major goal of ecological speciation is to understand how divergent selection on individual traits contributes to the evolution of reproductive barriers  Although many studies have demonstrated the evolution of ecological barriers in response to discrete niche shifts  empirical tests of ecological speciation along continuous ecological gradients remain scarce  We quantified early reproductive barriers among 11 populations of monkeyflower  Mimulus guttatus  Phrymaceae  spanning continuous life history variation along elevation gradients in California  We examined the pattern and strength of life history selection across two years in a montane habitat to test the hypothesis that traits under divergent selection underlie incipient barriers  We find that montane habitats favor perennial phenotypes  including later flowering  larger flowers  and increased investment in vegetative reproduction  In turn  these traits contribute to temporal and mating system isolation that increases with life history divergence  Together  this work provides a mechanistic link between life history selection and the early evolution of ecological barriers   
Centromere associated drive and the maintenance of fitness variation in Mimulus  Centromeres  which mediate chromosomal segregation  may act as selfish genetic elements by gaining excess transmission to the egg pole during asymmetric female meiosis  a process termed female meiotic drive   Female meiotic drive may have profound effects on the maintenance of individual fitness variation within populations  the evolution of species barriers  and karyotypic diversification  However  little is known about the incidence and effects of centromeric drive in natural populations   Previously  we characterized a novel centromere associated female meiotic drive system within the yellow monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus  and demonstrated that a balance of drive and male fitness costs  pollen inviability  were sufficient to maintain intra population polymorphism for drive  Here  we investigate additional fitness consequences of drive genotype with five years of field data on fruit number  seed production  and seedset per fruit  and also use bulk genome sequence data from multiple seedling cohorts to evaluate changes in drive haplotype frequency indicative of effects of survival  We observed an overall consistent negative effect of homozygosity for the driving haplotype on seedset  despite tremendous year to year variation in fecundity   but relatively little effect on other fitness components  This suggests that female fitness costs may also contribute to balancing selection on the drive locus  and  conversely  that drive contributes to the maintenance of standing variation for both male and female fitness  We discuss possible mechanisms of reduced seedset in drive homozygotes  including reduced pollinator attraction  reduced self fertilization  and meiotic defects  In addition  we demonstrate that the drive locus is polymorphic in a neighboring population  but that fitness costs appear different there  suggesting that they reflect hitchhiking by deleterious recessive alleles rather than an intrinsic cost of homozygosity for the driving centromere  
Population genomic correlates of inbreeding depression in outcrossing Caenorhabditis species  Inbreeding depression is one of the most familiar examples of genetics at work  Basic parameters such as mating system  population size and metapopulation dynamics are expected to interact with the underlying genetic architecture and distribution of selective effects  with the potential for different outcomes for different evolutionary histories  The Caenorhabditis genus provides extreme examples  while the outcrossing C  remanei suffers strong inbreeding depression  outbreeding depression is seen for the predominantly selfing  androdioecious C  elegans  We have found substantial variation in inbreeding depression both within and among outcrossing species C  remanei  C  sp  28  C  sp  29 and C  kamaaina  C  sp  15   measured as time to extinction across replicate lines for 20 generations of sib mating  Sequencing and annotation of surviving inbred line genomes  along with the founding populations from which they were derived  allows accurate measurement of relative nucleotide diversity and estimation of the functional impact of a large sample of segregating mutations  Surprisingly  we find no correlation between diversity and the severity of inbreeding depression  Fitness estimates and variant effect prediction efforts are ongoing  and initial results suggest inbreeding may be better predicted by the load of highly deleterious mutations  and by correlates of selection efficacy such as codon bias   
 Linking gene flow to changes in traits  fitness  and population dynamics in the wild               A fundamental  yet still unresolved question in evolutionary and conservation biology is how gene flow affects local adaptation  fitness  and population dynamics  Gene flow can break down local adaptation by introducing maladaptive alleles  or wipe out local distinctiveness  especially if generalist genotypes dominate  Inbred recipient populations are especially vulnerable to genomic sweeps following gene flow  where the majority of the populations genes originate from immigrants  Alternatively  gene flow may speed up adaptive evolution  e g   to a changing climate  by increasing the working surface of natural selection               We took advantage of recent introduction experiments using Trinidadian guppies to test the effects of gene flow from adaptively divergent immigrants on traits  individual fitness  and population dynamics in native  genetically depauperate  recipient populations  We monitored gene flow  survival  and population dynamics for 3 months pre  and 26 months post introduction using mark recapture techniques  A suite of known fitness related phenotypic traits  coloration  morphology  life history  were quantified for each individual from the wild populations  In addition  common garden assays were carried out pre  and post gene flow in order to determine whether changes in traits had a genetic basis  To evaluate reproductive success we reconstructed a wild pedigree for the monitored populations  Individual survival and population growth rate were evaluated with mark recapture data in Program MARK              We documented extensive gene flow from initially maladapted  translocated guppies into native recipient populations  Levels of heterozygosity  allelic richness  and effective population size increased after the onset of gene flow  In addition  results from common garden assays revealed genetically based changes in traits caused by gene flow  Despite seasonal variation  gene flow ultimately resulted in steep increases in individual fitness  defined by survival and reproductive success  and overall population size  In general  our results suggest that gene flow provided major fitness benefits to recipient populations  likely caused by genetic rescue  But  these benefits may have come at the cost of losing the native genetic signature  
Differential Coevolutionary Dynamics of E  coli and Lambda Phage in Two Resource Environments  The coevolutionary process between phage and bacterial populations is considered a driver of ecological in microbial communities  A major challenge remains whether the understanding of phage bacteria interactions from laboratory studies can be translated into the wild  We investigated the role of the environment in the coevolutionary process between the bacterium Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage Lambda during a 20 day long coevolutionary experiment  Using a metagenomic approach  we found different levels of genetic polymorphism underlying host resistance evolution according to the nature of the carbon source available in the environment  More strikingly  those differences were found while the same resistance mechanism  i e  the loss of the phage receptor  evolved in the two environments  An analytical model showed that a difference in the cost of resistance can be responsible for these results  a high cost of resistance in one environment triggers frequency dependent selection between resistant and sensitive genotypes allowing the maintenance of a high allelic polymorphism in the host population  This study underlines that environment is an important force for coevolutionary dynamics in phage bacteria systems  It also highlights the complexity of the mechanisms responsible for the evolution and the ecology of microbial communities in the wild  
Phylogeographic model selection using approximated likelihoods  Phylogeography aims to elucidate the evolutionary processes that underlie the spatial distribution of genetic variation in closely related groups  One way to achieve this is by estimating the values of parameters thought to have contributed to observed phylogeographic patterns by fitting genetic data to a specific coalescent model in either a likelihood or Bayesian framework  If the appropriate model is uncertain  another option is to compare the relative probability of two or more such models  and estimate parameters from the most probable model  for example  using ABC   However  a remaining question is how can we evaluate the quality of our set of considered models relative to the set of possible models that are not under consideration  Phrapl is a novel method for phylogeographic model selection that evaluates the fit of sampled gene trees to all possible models using approximated likelihoods  These models consist of the different combinations of parameters that define one or more coalescent events  migration rates  and effective population sizes  Here  we evaluate the performance of phrapl using both simulated and empirical datasets  Results from these analyses suggest that phrapl can be a powerful tool for phylogeographic model selection  helping to ensure that we estimate parameters of interest while fitting the data to the most probable model

Differential expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes may underlie function in gall midges  Carotenoids are conjugated isoprenoid molecules with a number of important physiological functions in organisms  including roles in photosynthesis  oxidative stress reduction  vision  diapause  photoperiodism  and immunity  Until recently  it was believed that only plants  microorganisms  and fungi were capable of synthesizing carotenoids and that animals acquired them from their diet  but studies have demonstrated that three arthropod clades  aphids  spider mites  and gall midges  acquired via lateral gene transfer a pair of genes homologous to those required for the initial steps of carotenoid biosynthesis  To assess the functional significance of the gene transfer and subsequent gene duplication events within various gall midge  Diptera  Cecidomyiidae  lineages  we examined phytoene synthase  phytoene desaturase  and lycopene cyclase expression by real time quantitative PCR in larvae  pupae  and adult Asteromyia carbonifera flies  We also examined general expression differences between A  carbonifera and five other ecologically diverse gall midge species using RNA seq  Gene expression information was correlated with insect carotenoid composition to develop a proposed model for the revised carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in gall midges  
Molecular species delimitation methods recover most song delimited cicada species in the European Cicadetta montana complex  Molecular species delimitation is increasingly being used to discover and inform species level diversity and a number of methods have been developed  Here we compared two molecular species delimitation methods  BPP and GMYC  with song delimited species in the Cicadetta montana cryptic species complex  Hemiptera  Cicadidae  which is found throughout Europe  Recent bioacoustics studies of male calling songs  pre mating reproductive barriers  have revealed cryptic species diversity not previously recognized with morphological methods  Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were used to analyze the mitochondrial genes COI and COII and the nuclear genes EF1  and period for twelve European Cicadetta species as well as the closely related monotypic genus Euboeana  Overall  the two molecular species delimitation methods used in this study were largely congruent  Used together   they were able to recover most song delimited species and revealed additional cryptic species diversity   
Metabolic variation in natural populations of wild yeast  The amount of standing genetic variation determines the capacity of a population to adapt rapidly   We investigated genetic variation for the utilization of carbon substrates in wild populations of budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus   All isolates grew well on a core diet of about 10 substrates and most were also able to grow on a much larger ancillary diet comprising most of the 190 substrates we tested   There was substantial genetic variation within each population for some substrates   Pairwise genetic correlations between substrates were predominantly positive  reflecting overall variation in metabolic performance  but there was a consistent negative correlation between categories of substrates in two cases  between the core diet and the ancillary diet  and between pentose and hexose sugars   Such negative correlations in the utilization of substrate from different categories may indicate either intrinsic physiological tradeoffs for the uptake and utilization of substrates from different categories  or the accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutations   We found geographical variation of substrate use at continental  regional and local scales  Isolates from Europe and North America could be distinguished on the basis of the pattern of yield across substrates  Two geographical races at the North American sites also differed in the pattern of substrate utilization  Substrate utilization patterns were also geographically correlated at local spatial scales  Divergence in substrate use accompanies genetic divergence at all spatial scales in Saccharomyces paradoxus and may contribute to race formation and speciation  
Theory of identity by descent in sequentially Markov coalescent models  Identity by descent  IBD  is a central concept in the study of genetic variation  IBD is analyzed for a variety of purposes  ranging from genotype imputation and heritibility estimation to pedigree reconstruction and demographic inference  I will discuss new theoretical results related to gene IBD  which considers contiguous segments of a chromosome inherited from a single common ancestor  These results are obtained by considering two sequentially Markov coalescent models  SMC and SMC   Under these models  I calculate the marginal distribution of IBD segment lengths  I also calculate the distribution of IBD segment ages conditional on segment length  and I use this distribution to show that the age of IBD segments of lengths typically analyzed in recent studies is too ancient to reflect any features particular to the pedigree of the individuals from which the chromosomes were sampled  Finally  I investigate the process of mutation along IBD segments and calculate the probability of true mutational identity for gene IBD segments of different lengths  I find that the number of mutations along a segment quickly converges to a Negative Binomial distribution as the IBD segment length increases  and I show that the shortest segments of gene IBD have the greatest probability of being entirely identical  despite the fact that short IBD segments tend to be older than long IBD segments  Throughout  I find that predictions made with SMC model are indistinguishable from the results of simulations of the ancestral recombination graph  Potential applications to inference of mutation rate and demography will also be discussed  
 Thymol mediates three way interactions between Thymus  Lamiaceae   legumes  and rhizobia   Researchers have long known that species in the mint family  Lamiaceae  exude essential oils containing biologically active compounds  We are interested in exploring the potential ecological effects of these secondary compounds in natural plant communities and agroecosystems  Thymol  a principal component of the essential oil of Thymus spp   is an anti microbial compound used commercially for its broad spectrum activity  This study examined the effect of thymol  in biologically realistic concentrations  on nodule formation in Medicago sativa  alfalfa  and Vigna unguiculata  cowpea   Experiments were initiated in a greenhouse at the University of Virginias Blandy research station in Boyce  VA in summer 2012 and 2013  For alfalfa  we used three treatments   1  control   2  addition of 0 3 ng pure thymol  3  addition of thyme essential oil containing 0 3 ng thymol  For cowpea  we examined three extra early maturing varieties of cowpea developed by the IITA in Nigeria with treatments  1  and  2  above as well as  3  growth with thyme seedlings  Inoculated seeds were sown in a high drainage soil mixture in 50 cell deep plug trays  Trays were placed in randomized blocks with supplemental lighting  16 8 light L D cycle   with watering as needed  and with weekly fertilization using 1 5 Hoagland solution without nitrogen  After three weeks  the thymol treatment significantly increased the number of nodules and seedling root weight in alfalfa  In older alfalfa seedlings  five weeks   the thymol treatment also significantly increased shoot weight  In all three varieties of cowpea  significantly more nodules per seedling were observed in treatments with thyme or thymol after five weeks  Two of the three varieties of cowpea also showed significantly larger roots in treatments with thyme and thymol  This study reinforces the importance of a wider community level view in evaluating the interactions between legumes and their symbionts  particularly since mints  Lamiaceae  co occur worldwide with legumes  Fabaceae  in natural communities  These results also have implications for improving plant nutrition and soil fertility in agroecosystems  Drought tolerant legumes like cowpea are critical to food security in rainfed systems such as the Sahel that are threatened by increasing aridity due to global climate change  Further research is underway with carvacrol and other exudates from Lamiaceae to examine impacts on plant microbial mutualisms  Much is still to learn about the role of bioactive root exudates in mediating multi species interactions contributing to defense or mutualisms in the rhizosphere  A community level perspective is essential since these interactions are likely to be diffuse and context dependent  
Functional analysis of the B gene homolog PISTILLATA reveals novel regulatory interactions controlling stamen identity in Aquilegia coerulea  Within the context of the ABC model for floral organ identity determination  the canonical function of the B gene PISTILLATA  PI  is establishment and maintenance of petal and stamen organ identity  Down regulation of PI homologs in diverse model plant systems such as Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum results in homeotic conversion of petals to sepals and stamens to carpels  However  in Aquilegia coerulea  which bears four to seven whorls of stamens  down regulation of AqPI results in homeotic transformation of outer stamens to sepals and inner stamens to sepal carpel or stamen carpel chimeras  These results suggest  first  that expression of the C gene homologs  which normally promote stamen and carpel identity  may be dependent on B gene function  and second  that outer and inner stamens differ in their sensitivities to both B and C gene expression  Interestingly  similar studies of other Ranunculid model systems have revealed some parallels  indicating that this novel regulatory interaction between the B and C class gene homologs may be more broadly conserved  The present study opens new avenues for further evolutionary developmental and genetic studies to better understand how varying in floral morphology  such as the production of a wide domain of stamens  may correlate with changes in regulatory interactions among the floral organ identity genes   
Testosterone and sexually transmitted bacterial assemblages in a wild bird  Sexually transmitted infections have been suggested as major costs of sexual reproduction  but the mechanisms underlying transmission have been largely overlooked  Testosterone is a hormone that modulates several aspects of reproduction  including the number of sexual contacts  Additionally  in some instances  prolonged high levels of testosterone are related to immunosuppression and disease risk  Therefore  testosterone has the potential to affect sexually transmitted infections  either indirectly by behaviors that increase contact rates with parasites  or directly by decreasing immune function  Our hypothesis is that males with high levels of testosterone would incur in more promiscuous behaviors that increase their chances of being infected with a wider diversity of cloacal bacteria  To test this hypothesis  we sampled breeding Zonotrichia capensis males for circulating testosterone levels and performed cloacal swabs to collect bacteria  The bacterial DNA from the swabs was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq  Sequence data were analyzed for cloacal bacteria diversity and community composition  There was a positive correlation between testosterone levels and bacterial phylogenetic diversity  even though there was high intra individual variability in the abundance of bacterial taxa  Contrary to our expectations  in an NMDS analysis  high and medium testosterone individuals had communities that were more similar to each other than to low testosterone individuals  Proteobacteria dominated these last ones  Finally  looking at possible pathogenic groups  Chlamydiae was positively correlated with testosterone levels  Two nonexclusive explanations for these results are that testosterone is mediating sexual contact rates and thus the acquisition of more bacterial strains  and that testosterone is directly weakening the immune system and bacteria infect more easily  Alternatively  infections at pathological levels might be preventing some individuals from raising their testosterone to normal breeding levels  
 Broad Sense  Sexual Conflict  A New Model of Evolution of Resistance to Sexual Violence  Current models of sexual conflict over mating largely conflate mating preference and resistance to forced copulation  and thus have focused narrowly on the direct fitness costs that females incur by mating with males that harm them  Recent work on antagonistic genital coevolution in waterfowl suggests that indirect fitness  opportunity  costs to females associated from forced copulation by non preferred individuals may be key to understanding the evolution of traits such as female vaginal complexity that control rates of forced fertilization but not sexual attack  While the processes of behaviorally choosing mates and cryptically  choosing  them via genital complexity both affect male mating success  their effects are not additive  We propose a new  broader framework that treats behavioral preference and resistance to forced fertilization as explicitly independent traits  Using four locus theoretical population genetic models  we show that female genital complexity can evolve via conflict over mate choice due to its role in enhancing females  ability to retain attractive mates  Females that manage to resist coercion and mate with attractive males pass on those advantages to their offspring  Our broader concept of sexual conflict that incorporates indirect costs and multiple simultaneous forms of mate choice is necessary for understanding the evolution of traits that enhance sexual freedom of choice  and applies widely in natural systems  
Temporal scaling of spontaneous mutation rates   implications for the neutral theory of molecular evolution  Temporal scaling is to rates and their corresponding time denominators as fractal scaling is to sizes and their corresponding measurement unit denominators   Spontaneous mutation rates  mutations nucleotide generation  are known for substantial samples of  1  ssRNA+   2  ssRNA    3  dsRNA   4  ssDNA   5  dsDNA   6  bacterial DNA   7  unicellular eukaryote DNA   8  multicellular eukaryote DNA   9  multicellular eukaryote mtDNA  and  10  human pedigree mtDNA   Temporal scaling of rates for each group yields log rate versus log interval  LRI  temporal scaling slopes that are consistently negative  with slope values ranging from  0 31 to  0 66    Negative slopes mean that rates averaged over multiple generations substantially underestimate the base rate of interest   the rate per generation on a time scale of one generation   Stochastic change typically has a negative temporal scaling slope  but the expectation for random mutation is a slope on the order of only about  0 05   In four  and probably seven  of the ten RNA  DNA  and mtDNA groups studied  observed temporal scaling slopes are significantly more negative than expected by chance   Slopes more negative than expected indicate that molecular evolution is systematically constrained rather than neutral   This constraint is a signature of stabilizing natural selection   Finally  negative temporal scaling slopes dictate the mathematical form of clock like behavior for molecular evolution driven by spontaneous mutation  
 Genome sequencing  assembly and analysis of the four cactus host populations of Drosophila mojavensis      Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation is one of the fundamental questions in biology   A complete grasp of the genetic architecture of adaptation can best be attained by a multifaceted approach  which incorporates not only information of the local ecological environment of the organism but as well as an understanding of genome level variation and divergence   Here we examine genomic divergence across the four ecologically distinct cactus host populations of Drosophila mojavensis   This necrotic cactus breeding species inhabits the deserts of the US southwest and northwest Mexico   Each population utilizes a distinct cactus species  providing resident populations with a unique chemical environment   The recent divergence of these populations       Illumina sequencing was performed on inbred lines from each of the three populations  Sonora Desert  Mojave Desert and Baja California  at an approximate coverage of about 65X   Reads were then template assembled to the previous sequenced genome of D  mojavensis  from Catalina Island    Per population  we were able to reconstitute 93 97  of the template genome s scaffolds   Using our analysis pipeline  14 238 loci of the 14 581 loci in the template genome were obtained  of which we were able to obtain complete alignments across the four populations for 13 517 loci   Rates of protein evolution were determined for all loci using a several approaches   Genes with evidence of positive selection  422 after FDR correction  were linked to the local ecological environment and involved several biological functions including metabolism  reproduction  and response to stimuli   Genes with accelerated rate of evolution were overrepresented in the X and dot chromosomes   There was an association between expression level and rate of evolution  with the gene set composed of low expression transcripts overrepresented for the high dN dS ratio class genes   Furthermore  we observed that genes that were transcriptionally regulated in response to cactus host shift were significantly more likely to have evolved under positive selection   Results of this study provides insight into local ecological adaptation and the early process of speciation  
Fairness and Wisdom  Paths to Leadership  Groups make decisions in various ways  quorums  consensus  leadership  or some combination thereof  Leadership  where an individual organizes a group to achieve a common goal  is not only ubiquitous in human culture but has significantly impacted the course of human history  To determine how and why leaders emerge we introduce a model for group decision making  We consider a group of individuals which differ in their preference for a course of action  personality traits  and or knowledge  Group members go through rounds of dyadic speaker listener interactions with the listener changing their preferences in the direction of that of the speaker  We conduct a comparison of the various decision making mechanisms by analyzing the costs incurred by foregoing individual preferences and the time it takes for the group to reach a decision  Consensus mechanisms favor individual preferences for speed while more despotic strategies opt for speed while sacrificing the preferences of the majority  If timeliness outweighs preferences we observe more dictatorial styles of leadership emerging and along with them their correlated personality traits  e g  stubbornness   However  extant small scale communities tend to actively discourage following leaders with these personality traits  instead preferring to follow those who are wise  knowing the optimal course of action  or fair  reducing the loss of individual preferences   To account for this discrepancy we propose and explore possible mechanisms for the development of a reputation for being a wise or being a fair leader  
Tempo and mode of regulatory evolution in Drosophila  Genetic changes affecting gene expression contribute to phenotypic divergence  thus understanding how regulatory networks controlling gene expression change over time is critical for understanding evolution  Prior studies of expression differences within and between species have identified properties of regulatory divergence  but technical and biological differences among these studies make it difficult to assess the generality of these properties or to understand how regulatory changes accumulate with divergence time  Here  we address these issues by comparing gene expression among strains and species of Drosophila with a range of divergence times and use F1 hybrids to examine inheritance patterns and disentangle cis  and trans regulatory changes  We find that the fixation of compensatory changes has caused the regulation of gene expression to diverge more rapidly than gene expression itself  Specifically  we observed that the proportion of genes with evidence of cis regulatory divergence has increased more rapidly with divergence time than the proportion of genes with evidence of expression differences  Surprisingly  the amount of expression divergence explained by cis regulatory changes did not increase steadily with divergence time  as was previously proposed  Rather  one species  D  sechellia  showed an excess of cis regulatory divergence that we argue most likely resulted from positive selection in this lineage  Taken together  this work reveals not only the rate at which gene expression evolves  but also the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this evolution  
Influence of mating system on genome evolution in Caenorhabditis  Self fertilization is predicted to reduce levels of standing genetic variation at neutral loci by one half  More importantly  however  self fertilization reduces the effective recombination rate  which should dramatically increase the opportunity for linkage disequilibrium  thus making the genomes from self fertilizing species more susceptible to selective sweeps and or background selection  In turn  these effects should have important consequences for distribution of genomic variation and the evolution of genomic structure  Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis display mating system variation in which selfing hermaphrodites have evolved independently from an outcrossing male female ancestor  Using a combination of next generation sequencing and genetic mapping approaches  we have assembled the genome of C  remanei  a close outcrossing relative of the selfing C  elegans model system  We can compare these genomes  together with that from C  briggsae  which has also independently evolved hermaphrodites  to gain insights into how the evolution of self fertilization influences genome structure  including the evolution of gene families and the evolution of genome size  
Disentangling the coevolutionary histories of animal gut microbiota      To what extent does coevolutionary history shape commensal microbial communities  Partner fidelity  linking fitness outcomes among partners  is thought to be an important stabilizer in mutualisms  over long enough timescales  it may result in codiversification  as is frequently observed in the vertically transmitted endosymbionts of insects  But can historical partner fidelity operate effectively on complex extracellular communities  in the face of competition from exogenous microbes and greater opportunity for horizontal transmission       Here  using two ant genera as test cases  we introduce methods to explore whether individual lineages of gut bacteria have codiversified with their animal hosts  Beginning with a host genus  Polyrhachis  known to harbor the codiversifying endosymbiont Blochmannia  we demonstrate that 16S rRNA amplicon sequence data can reveal expected patterns of codiversification with both specificity and some sensitivity  Extending this analysis to an ant genus known to harbor a dense and specific bacterial gut community  Cephalotes   we recover patterns of codiversification across a taxonomically diverse subset of the microbiota  We then use shotgun metagenomic sequencing to verify and elaborate these findings  estimating well supported multi gene phylogenies for the some of the most abundant microbial taxa  Finally  we demonstrate the general utility of these tools by identifying candidate codiversified bacterial lineages in published comparative metagenomic datasets for mammals in general and hominids specifically  We show that putatively codiversified bacterial lineages recovered from these datasets are also present in human microbiota    though at significantly different abundances in some groups of humans than in others        Our results suggest that partner fidelity can be sufficiently strong to link the fates of host and gut microbe over millions of years of evolution  As additional comparative microbiome data become available  the techniques presented here will become a powerful tool for exploring broad trends in the evolution of host associated microbial communities  
 Impact of self fertilization on fecundity  the timing of reproduction  and population genetic structure  in a marine ribbon worm  Nemertea    Organisms capable of self fertilization typically exhibit two evolutionary syndromes uniting high inbreeding depression with low levels of selfing  or low inbreeding depression and high levels of selfing  This study tests for inbreeding depression in an apparent self compatible  hermaphroditic marine nemertean worm  Prosorhochmus americanus  Fecundity and timing to first reproduction were assessed in isolated and paired worms  Isolated worms produced significantly more offspring than paired worms and did not show inbreeding avoidance   The selfing rate of natural populations was evaluated using species specific microsatellites and is consistent with preferential selfing  mean  0 801   though some outcrossing appears to take place  Population genetic structure indicates populations are disjunct and characterized by low levels of gene flow  Our results reveal P  americanus exhibits an interesting suite of life history traits  uniting high dispersal potential through self fertilization and high fecundity  with the lack of a dispersive larval stage and low levels of gene flow  
Comparative quantitative genetics of the pelvis in four species of rodents  Evolution of the genetic and phenotypic covariance structure  Quantitative genetics has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for understanding how populations will evolve over microevolutionary timescales  Its application in understanding macroevolutionary patterns is debated as assumptions must be made about the long term stability of the underlying genetic and phenotypic variances and covariance s contained in the G and P matrix respectively  If these matrices are stable or change predictably then comparative quantitative genetics would be a way to bridge microevolutionary processes with macroevolutionary patterns  We conducted full sib breeding programs to estimate G and P matrices for eight pelvic traits in two species of sigmodontine rodents from South America  the leaf eared mice Phyllotis xanthopygus and P  darwinii  To expand the phylogenetic breadth of this study we compared G and P in Phyllotis to the two species reported for the same traits in Kohn and Atchley  1998   Mus norvegicus and Rattus rattus  Murinae   Using a phylogenetic comparative framework we tested the degree of divergence among all G and P matrices  We discuss the evolutionary stability of these over macroevolutionary timescales  and the correlation of matrix divergence with time  
The Co evolution Between MT and NU Genes in Insects  Co evolutionary interactions between the mitochondrial  mt  and nuclear  nuc  genomes can play a significant role in the evolutionary dynamics of both genomes  However  the co evolutionary process in a broad range of insects is largely unknown  One of the most tightly interacting pathways is the oxidative phosphorylation  OXPHOS  system  which involves both mt and nuc genes  As mt genes harbor high mutation rate  related nuc genes might have compensatory adaptation to maintain OXPHOS function  As a result  nuc OXPHOS genes may be under strong selection pressure and evolve more rapidly than nuclear genes that are not involved in mitochondrial nuclear interactions   Hymenopterans show exceptionally high rates of mitochondrial molecular evolution compared to other insects  making this taxa an excellent model to test for evidence of compensatory evolution driven by genome genome interactions  This co evolutionary interaction consequently elevates the evolutionary rate of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes in Hymenopterans compared to other insects  We tested this hypothesis by comparing the evolutionary rates  synonymous substitution rate and nonsynonymous substitution rate  among three genes groups  mt OXPHOS  nuc OXPHOS  and nuc  in Holometabola insects  including Hymenoptera  Coleoptera  Lepidoptera and Diptera  Relevant gene orthologs were annotated from transcriptomes generated by the 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution  1KITE  www 1kite org  project   Based on the combined analysis of 28 OXPHOS subunits across 33 species  we want to address the questions that  1  is there compensatory evolution on nuc genes driven by mt genes  and 2  whether a haplodiploid sex determination system leads to higher evolutionary rates on OXPHOS genes compared to other sexual determination system  
Genetic basis of ageing evolution under differential extrinsic mortality in a nematode 
Shaking the parrotfish tree  hybridization in a peripheral environment produces phenotypic novelty  An increasing range of examples show that hybridization can play a creative role in generating new phenotypes and even new species  Yet there are few examples of hybrid zones among tropical reef fishes  and these involve closely related species  We sequenced four nuclear introns in samples of the parrotfishes Scarus compressus  S  ghobban  and S  perrico from the Pearl Islands  These nuclear markers provide clear evidence that each of five S  compressus was an F1 hybrid resulting from crosses between S  ghobban and S  perrico  Each S  compressus sample was heterozygous at each locus  carrying diagnostic alleles for each parental species  Since the range of S  compressus  described in 1916  extends from the Gulf of California to Ecuador  this morphospecies is either maintained by constant  and frequent at some sites  hybridization  or is the product of homoploid hybrid speciation in which recombinant genotypes  F2 hybrids  etc   have yet to be documented  We will further evaluate these two hypotheses with larger sample sizes and new genetic data from Baja California  Regardless of mechanism  to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the formation of a region wide hybrid zone that involves hybridization between distantly related parrotfishes   
RNAseq analysis elucidate early responses to infection in scleractinian corals  Diseases have become one of the major causes of coral mortality and coral reef deterioration worldwide  The emergence of coral diseases has been associated with climate change  yet disease prevalence and mortality are highly variable and apparently species dependent   In the Caribbean for example  important species  like Acropora spp  have suffered geographic wide population crashes by what seemed to be a single disease  Other important reef builders such as Orbicella spp  have suffered significant population declines but caused by a host of several different diseases  However  there are species that seem to be resistant and are thriving  Porites spp  for example  are becoming more abundant even in areas were corals have been replaced by other fast growing organism  i e  algae   To analyze the molecular basis of this disparity  we exposed coral colonies from four species to lipopolysaccharides  LPS  and analyzed changes in gene expression a few hours after exposure  We used RNA seq analysis to understand early responses to infection of corals differentially affected by diseases  Preliminary data suggest that coral species display particular responses to the initial stages of infection  with no apparent relation to the number of diseases affecting each host  Orbicella faveolata  8 diseases  and Porites astreoides   5  showed significant changes between exposed and control fragments  In Porites porites  3  and Pseudodiploria strigosa  6  changes in expression were significant at the individual colony level but not across treatments  It appears as if the molecular machinery in corals responds differentially based on the genetic composition of each species and the genotype of each individual colony   
Understanding Biodiversity for Targeted Natural Product Discoveries in Marine Cyanobacteria  Abstract Marine cyanobacteria are known for their prolific biosynthetic capacities to produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites with biomedical application and the ability to form harmful algal blooms  cyanoHABs   In an effort to provide taxonomic clarity to better guide future natural products drug discovery explorations  we have investigated the systematics of tropical and subtropical natural product producing marine cyanobacteria based on their evolutionary relatedness  Our phylogenetic inferences of marine cyanobacterial strains responsible for over 125 bioactive secondary metabolites reveal an uneven taxonomic distribution with a few groups being responsible for the vast majority of these molecules  Our data also suggest a high degree of novel biodiversity among natural product producing strains that previously was overlooked by traditional morphology based taxonomic approaches  This unrecognized biodiversity is primarily due to a lack of proper classification systems since the taxonomy of tropical and subtropical marine cyanobacteria has only recently been analyzed by phylogenetic methods  Furthermore  we are finding direct correlations between the productions of specific secondary metabolites and the phylogenetic positions of the producing strains  This evolutionary study provides a framework for a more robust classification system to better understand the taxonomy of tropical and subtropical marine cyanobacteria and the distribution of natural products in marine cyanobacteria  Here we discuss our research efforts at the Smithsonian Institution in providing taxonomic systems for classification and identification of these novel NP rich taxa  Thus  these taxonomic descriptions provide classification systems that are able to identify the cyanobacteria and predict their production of bioactive secondary metabolites   
Genomics of Variation in Nutrient Metabolism and Stress Resistance in Yeast  The genomic basis of adaptation to diverse environments is an outstanding question in evolution  Further  the extent that co variation or tradeoffs among sets of traits  or among environmental parameters  shapes patterns of variation in poorly studied  We took advantage of the diverse habitats and variable ability to assimilate alternative nutrient sources in budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to identify patterns of co variation and its possible genomic basis  We examined the growth of diverse strains of S  cerevisiae across environmental parameters  18 carbon and 3 nitrogen sources  and 2 different stressors  in a fractional factorial experiment  We show that there is significant variation in growth among strains across environmental and nutrient conditions  and significant interaction terms relating growth among carbon and nitrogen sources  and carbon sources and stressors  We took advantage of available genome sequence for a subset of these strains to examine the genetic basis of this growth variation   We find that both gene content and copy number variation play a role in the variation in environmental and nutrient responses we observe across strains  
 The secrets of staying young  Investigating the evolution of venom neoteny in the Timber Rattlesnake  Crotalus horridus    Ontogeny is a source of phenotypic variation on which selection can act  However  the process by which selection can act on developmental patterns to give rise to fixed genetic differences remains unclear  To elucidate this process  the molecular mechanisms of ontogeny must first be unraveled in a context where the adaptive benefits can be established  Several species of Viperidae have been observed to undergo ontogenetic transitions in venom composition  including the Timber Rattlesnake  Crotalus horridus  a pit viper found across the eastern half of the United States  Two major venom types have been identified in separate populations of this species  a hemorrhagic venom type that undergoes a dramatic shift upon reaching adulthood  and a neurotoxic venom type that has evolved a unique neurotoxin and no longer undergoes the dramatic shift  instead retaining its juvenile venom  The presence absence of key toxin classes in this ecologically critical trait likely represents evolutionary trade offs  To better assess the genetic and proteomic differences between these venoms  we sequenced and analyzed the venom gland transcriptomes of a juvenile hemorrhagic venom type prior to ontogenetic transition and an adult of each subtype  Putative toxin transcripts were confirmed in the venom using mass spectrometry  By comparing these individuals we determined genetic and proteomic differences between the subtypes and examined possible mechanisms by which these two venom types evolved  In addition  we sequenced microRNAs from the venom glands of each individual and compared them to assess the possible role of translational repression in the differences observed between juvenile and adult venoms  
Genomic signatures of life history divergence during speciation  diapause as a complex target of selection in Rhagoletis fruit flies   Ecological speciation in phytophygous insects often involves shifts to new hosts with different seasonal availability  These shifts cause strong divergent selection on life history traits involved in seasonal synchrony that may ecologically isolate races that infest different hosts  We have identified genomic variation associated with a recent shift of Rhagoletis pomonella  Diptera  Tephritidae  from native haw to introduced apple that is consistent with strong selection on life history variation  Here  using genome wide snp genotyping and resprirometric analysis of metabolic depression  we identify specific targets of selection on diapause  the central life history trait that mediates seasonal synchrony  We discuss how patterns of linkage disequilibrium and correlations among diapause life history traits influence the patterns of divergence at the genomic level  
Connecting macroevolution to the genetics of adaptation  a case study using stomatal ratio  Variation in quantitative traits is often characterized by a unimodal distribution  a few species reside in the tails of the distribution  but most are clustered about the mean  In contrast  some traits are multimodal  hinting at distinct peaks in the adaptive landscape  Here  we focus on a recently identified case of multimodality in stomatal ratio among terrestrial plants  Plants typically have all their stomata on the bottom of leaf  hypostomy  or roughly half their stomata on both leaf surfaces  amphistomy   with a dearth of intermediates between these states   We analyze a simple cost benefit model of stomatal ratio which predicts that intermediates are rare because they are often universally unfit  falling in a valley between two peaks in an adaptive landscape  However  this raises the classic problem of how peak shifts can occur  One possibility is that mutations of large effect allow peaks shifts by passing over fitness valleys  Consistent with this hypothesis  we identify two large effect loci that account for most of the interspecific difference in stomatal ratio between hypo  and amphistomatous tomato species  Our work suggests that multimodality in stomatal ratio reflects distinct fitness peaks and that fitness valleys might not impose strong constraints over macroevolutionary time when large effect mutations are available  
Species tree methods and ultraconserved elements  UCEs   a case study in galliform birds  Sequence capture using probes for ultraconserved elements  UCEs  followed by next generation sequencing has become a popular method to collect data for phylogenetic analyses in vertebrates  Although powerful overall  many individual UCEs exhibit limited variation  especially when the amount of flanking DNA is limited or when UCEs from closely related taxa are compared  This can result in poorly resolved estimates of gene trees when individual UCEs are analyzed  The poor resolution of individual gene trees presents a challenge for phylogenetic analyses that summarize gene trees using a multispecies coalescent framework  We present the result of analyses using UCE data from a set of galliform birds  pheasants and partridges  that underwent a relatively recent evolutionary radiation  The data matrix we collected comprised almost 1 500 loci and more than 600 kb of data  Multiple phylogenetic analyses of concatenated data and individual gene trees were conducted and the results of these analyses will be discussed  demonstrating conditions under which specific coalescent based methods can prove to be problematic   
Developmental plasticity and reproductive fitness in the house mouse  It has been argued that developmental plasticity allows young to match their phenotype to the environmental conditions experienced by their mothers   In particular  maternal diet is believed to  adaptively program  young for performing well when they consume a diet that is comparable to what their mother consumed during gestation and lactation  i e  the environmental matching hypothesis   Despite the ubiquity of this hypothesis  there is little empirical evidence addressing the impact of maternal diet on offspring fitness  The goals of our study were to 1  confirm that an individual s physiological phenotype is altered by maternal diet under natural conditions  and 2  determine if mice that consume a diet comparable to the diet of their parents have greater fitness than those that consume a mismatched diet  This work was conducted in wild derived populations of house mice  Mus musculus  maintained in arenas that mimic natural home range and population size and density  The parental generation was maintained on 10  or 20  protein diet  After weaning  F1 offspring were kept on the same diet as their parents or switched to the alternate diet  Treatment impacted male and female mice differently and we found mixed support for environmental matching based on the physiological variables that were measured  including metabolic rate  maturation of the reproductive axis  body fat  and organ mass    We found no support for environmental matching based on reproductive performance   Females in the low to high protein group displayed the earliest age at first reproduction  Following their first reproductive bout  those females consuming a high protein diet displayed higher reproductive performance than the low protein females  regardless of the diet that their parents consumed  The implications of the results will be discussed within the context of the evolution of developmental plasticity   
Open Tree of Life version 1 0  a comprehensive and easily updated tree of life  Open Tree of Life has made considerable progress on assembling an online  comprehensive and dynamic tree of life  We report on the release of version 1 0 in terms of completeness  coverage and conflict  on methods for visualizing and accessing OpenTree data and on challenges to keeping this tree up to date with published knowledge  The content and structure of the synthetic Open Tree of Life depends not on phylogenetic knowledge  but on digital availability and curation of that knowledge  There is  therefore  a conflict between a synthetic tree that accurately represents our collective wisdom about the tree of life and one that strictly summarizes digitally available and well curated phylogenies  There are simple data publication strategies that would greatly increase the usability of published phylogenies for Open Tree and other projects and reduce the downstream curation burden  We present curation tools to collaboratively annotate phylogenetic data and how novel database types enable synthesis and analysis of these data     
Estimating Evolutionary Parameters and Full Length Haplotypes Simultaneously Using Short Read Sequences Derived from Genetically Variable Populations  The advancement in next generation sequencing technologies allows researchers to obtain large amounts of genetic and genomic data in relative short periods of time  and at a fraction of the cost of conventional Sanger sequencing  Nevertheless  the evolutionary analysis of short read sequences generated from next generation sequencing remains challenging  We present a Bayesian method to derive posterior distributions of evolutionary parameters using next generation sequences obtained from a mixed sample of homologous sequences  The new method treats full length haplotypes as unknown parameters and calculates the joint posterior probability of the haplotypes  evolutionary parameters and genealogy  given the short read sequences  We apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo  MCMC  technique to recover this posterior distribution  Preliminary results show that the estimation of the evolutionary parameters of interest is comparable to results obtained using full length sequence alignments  
Fitness feedbacks and alignment of interests in mutualisms  Some of the most striking examples of cooperation involve individuals from different species provide benefits to each other for mutual gain  For a mutualism to be stable  natural selection has to align the fitness interests of the interacting species  so that helping the other species returns a fitness gain to a focal individual  We term this a  fitness feedback   While this principle has long been known  and various mechanisms for generating fitness feedbacks have been explored both in theory and empirical work  the relative importance of each mechanism  and interactions between them remain poorly understood  This is especially the case in interactions  such as the legume rhizobium symbiosis  where there are phenotypic and fitness feedbacks operating simultaneously at multiple scales  In this talk  I will present initial results for a framework for modeling fitness feedbacks at multiple scales  using the legume rhizobium mutualism as an example  My results highlight the consequences of the interactions between different feedback mechanisms for patterns of fitness covariation between species  and provide a framework in which to quantify fitness alignment between species  
Ants in the age of dinosaurs  a history from amber  Over the past ten years  several fossil discoveries have painted a new picture of early ant history  Cretaceous taxa are now known to have been remarkably diverse  many exhibiting morphological innovations not found in any groups living today  These stem group ants offer new insight into early ant evolution  in particular  valuable morphological data and information regarding their ecology  diversity  and sociality  Here  ancient ant taxa are contextualized through morphometric and phylogenetic analyses to evaluate the placement of fossil species and infer their role in paleoenvironments   
Increasing phylogenetic resolution in a hyperdiverse radiation of blood feeding flies  Tabanus is a lineage of hematophagous horse flies containing 1340 described species  and many more undescribed  Adult size and patterning are variable  and the predatory larvae can withstand a range of semi aquatic and arid environments  Comprehensive comparative studies on this group  which includes disease vectors  are stymied by a lack of modern taxonomic syntheses  A study focusing on the phylogeny of worldwide Tabanus is needed in order to understand the drivers and patterns of the evolution of this lineage and to make future taxonomic work feasible  We extracted five genes totaling 6 kb of nucleotide data from one hundred species in the Tabanus group  including nearly all genera of Tabanini and at least one species from every biogeographic region  Molecular phylogenetic investigation of this data shows that Tabanus includes at least fourteen other genera containing over 900 species  including morphologically distinct genera such as Haematopota  Neotropical species are the successive sister groups to the rest of Tabanus  The rest of the species of Tabanini s l  fall into about 8 major groups  some of which correspond to previously established genera  Relationships among these major groups have no resolution or support  New methods of data analysis and data sources are discussed in order to provide a useful and illuminating framework phylogeny  
Temporal Dynamics of a Ranavirus Outbreak in Chelonians with Mosquitoes as Possible Vectors  Ranaviruses are significant pathogens of amphibians  reptiles and fishes  contributing to mass mortality events worldwide  Despite an increasing focus on ranavirus ecology  our understanding of ranavirus dynamics  especially among reptilian hosts  remains limited  Specific knowledge deficits in chelonians includes mode of transmission  temporal dynamics during an outbreak  how infection covaries with environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation  and the efficacy of current noninvasive sampling techniques  To address these knowledge gaps  we repeatedly sampled a captive population  n   317  of eastern box turtles  Terrapene c  carolina  during an outbreak of the ranavirus strain frog virus 3  FV3   We also trapped and sampled mosquitoes to test the prediction that ranaviruses can be transmitted among Chelonians by arthropod vectors  Three mosquito samples tested positive for FV3 by qPCR  suggesting that mosquitoes may be involved in virus transmission as a mechanical or biological vector  Mortality was high  with at least 149 known mortalities by the end of the active season  Prevalence of FV3 ranged from 6 3  to 85 3   Prevalence followed precipitation temporal trends but not temperature  Sampling by standard oral swabbing and blood draw revealed suggested that FV3 can either become quiescent periodically or that clearing and reinfection is common  perhaps by mosquito vectors  
Accelerated Anchored Phylogenomics  A new paradigm enables 10 fold increase in throughput and 10 fold decrease in cost for phylogenomics   Targeted hybrid enrichment is quickly becoming one of the dominant forms of phylogenomic data collection  because of its broad application  utility for poor quality samples  and low cost relative to other approaches  Previous improvements in laboratory and bioinformatic workflows produced a pipeline with a throughput of  5000 samples per year per laboratory  Here  we present a new paradigm shifting approach that has the potential to accelerate data collection by a factor of 5 10  thereby enabling a single laboratory to collect hundreds or thousands of loci for  50 000 taxa in a single year  For example  this level of throughput could facilitate one research laboratory to collect phylogenomic scale data for every vertebrate species in just over one year  or for every insect species in  20 years  The new method also reduces costs by up to an order of magnitude  thus bringing phylogenomic scale data collection within reach of all researchers working in phylogenetics  phylogeography  and population genomics  
One species or three  Resolving lineage boundaries in dusky salamanders through sexual isolation trials and next generation sequencing  Study systems with low ecomorphological disparity and those lacking adequate genetic resources present a major challenge for systematics  The resolution of taxonomic ambiguities is further confounded in systems with a history of rapid evolutionary divergence and reticulate evolution  Disentangling these evolutionary relationships is an important goal and provides phylogenetic clarity useful for delimiting species and testing mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining genetic diversity  In concert with the analysis of genetic markers collected from sequencing mitochondrial and nuclear loci  experimental measures of sexual isolation are useful for identifying lineages and species boundaries indicative of pre zygotic isolation and the cessation of gene flow  Recent genetic surveys of dusky salamanders within the Southern Appalachians reveal extensive mitochondrial diversity within Desmognathus fuscus  a broadly distributed semi aquatic plethodontid salamander  Controlled reproductive isolation trials involving crosses within and between haplotype assemblages from western North Carolina reveal patterns of asymmetric sexual bias that may limit gene flow and contribute to the observed patterns of genetic diversification across sharp biogeographic clines  Forthcoming parallel tagged amplicon sequencing of multiple nuclear loci will leverage the power of next generation sequencing at the population level to resolve long standing questions of lineage boundaries and models of diversification in D  fuscus and other closely related lineages  
Flash signal evolution in North American Photinus fireflies  The study of communication systems is a complex topic in evolutionary biology  Communication systems consist of senders  signals and receivers  and the evolution of signals can be shaped by receivers and habitats  In this comprehensive study on the evolution of a visual communication system  a phylogenetic approach was used to study the flash communication signals of North American fireflies  With more than 30 described species  simple ON OFF visual signals  variation in light signal traits  along with field data on habitat types  sympatric congeners and predators  the North American firefly genus Photinus offers an ideal study system to test hypotheses on the evolution of male and female visual signal traits   
A Dictionary of Genetic Effects for the Drosophila Wing  Traditional studies of development have emphasized  the break it and show a picture the resulting mess  approach to genetics   Such experiments are not terribly relevant to evolution  as mutations with major effects usually drastically reduce fitness   Furthermore  they do not address the origins of variation in quantitative traits   We have constructed a Dictionary of Genetic Effects by quantitatively down regulated the expression of over 100 genes during Drosophila melanogaster development using RNAi  and measured the effects of these manipulations on wing shape    Approximately 40  percent of these knockdowns have a quantitative effect on shape  20  are lethal during development  and in the remaining 40  the evidence for an effect is ambiguous   Of those with effects  the majority have a linear effect on wing shape with degree of knockdown  but a few are strongly non linear in some way   Several genes show threshold effects  and others give a curved trajectory through shape space    The linear effects of these genes fall within a 6 dimensional space that is approximately the first six dimensions of genetic variation within natural populations of D  melanogaster   The major pathways that genes have been assigned is somewhat predictive of the nature of the phenotypic response  however vectors do not closely match effects inferred from a genome wide association study    We are able to predict some of the effects using our model of wing development   While our Dictionary contains only a few simple entries  a Dictionary of Genetic Effects would ultimately provide the foundation for studying the genotype phenotype  GP  map   Understanding the GP map is necessary to understand the effects of mutation  the nature of standing genetic variation  the relative impact of natural selection in phenotype space  and the genetics of species differences   
Partitioning additive and nonadditive genetic effects on offspring quality in a broadcast spawning marine invertebrate  In sexual selection  females can choose to mate with either males of higher genetic quality  or more genetically compatible males  Choice for both male quality and male compatibility increase female reproductive success by increasing the genetic quality of her offspring  Studies on broadcast spawning species have shown that species recognition happens at the level of gametes   eggs can recognize sperm of the same species  and it appears that this gamete level choice also occurs within species  Some male   female combinations of gametes result in higher fertilization success than others  but whether this reflects female choice for male quality or genetic compatibility remains unknown  Here  we used a diallel breeding design to partition additive genetic  i e  genetic quality  and nonadditive genetic  i e  genetic compatibility  effects on the association between fertilization success and offspring quality in the broadcast spawning ascidian Ciona intestinalis  We found that genetic quality effects were weaker than genetic compatibility effects  In addition  eigenanalysis of the additive genetic and nonadditive genetic covariance matrices indicated that the dimensionality of genetic quality effects was less than the dimensionality of genetic compatibility effects  Last  rotating the genetic space to align with the axis maximising associations between fertilization success and offspring quality revealed differing effects of genetic quality and genetic compatibility on offspring   genetic quality effects at fertilization were most strongly associated with increases in larval survival  whereas genetic compatibility effects at fertilization were most strongly associated with increases in juvenile survival  Overall  our results suggest that gametes that are more compatible at fertilization result in higher performing offspring  Furthermore  we provide evidence that mate choice can occur in the ancestral reproductive strategy of broadcast spawning  
 Phylogenomic analysis of yellowjackets and hornets  Hymenoptera  Vespidae    The Vespidae is a family of wasps exhibiting solitary and social phenotypes and thus a useful system for discovering genes that might have evolved novel roles linked to sociality  Within the Vespidae  hornets and yellowjackets are all social and show considerable diversity in their behavior  According to the traditional phylogenetic hypothesis  the yellowjackets are monophyletic and sister to the hornets  Recent genetic evidence  however  contradicts or fails to support the traditional phylogenetic hypothesis  Here  we test for the first time the genus level relationships of hornets and yellowjackets using a phylogenomic approach  We sampled six species and sequenced their transcriptomes to conduct a phylogenetic analysis  Our study includes 105 orthologs  121 909 aligned sites  that were chosen on the basis of two criteria  presence in all species and sequence length longer than 800 characters  Our results show  contrary to the traditional view  that hornets nest within yellowjackets  rendering the latter paraphyletic  The results of this phylogenomic study will be the foundation for future studies of molecular evolution across solitary and social lifestyles in the Vespidae  
 Using NGS to investigate differentially expressed genes and SNPs between closely related tephritid fruit flies  Anastrepha fraterculus and A  obliqua   Anastrepha fraterculus and A  obliqua are closely related South American fruit flies  Tephritidae  Diptera  that infest several different hosts and are morphologically similar  which renders their identification difficult  Previous studies have failed to identify genetic markers that separate the species due to their recent divergence  In this work  we generated multiple Next Generation Sequencing  NGS  cDNA libraries of A  obliqua and A  fraterculus and studied patterns of expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  seeking transcripts that may be involved with species differences  which would help us discriminate these species  We generated cDNA libraries from total RNA extracted from fly heads and reproductive tissues pooled from mature virgin and post mating males and females  as well as from post ovipositing females  with replicas  totaling 20 libraries per species  We generated close to 300 million reads  after trimming and filtering for quality on SeqyClean  We used a combination of Trinity and Velvet to assemble these data  after normalization  which led to about 180 000 contigs with N50 of 2012 and an average length of 1 225 bp  Over 46 000 contigs had more than 1 000 bp and almost 23 000 had more than 2 000 bp  We annotated these contigs using BLAST2go and used SAMtools and Bowtie2 to align each species reads back onto the total assembly  Our analyses found thousands of differentially expressed genes across the different reproductive stages studied  Our combined analyses identified over 100 000 intraspecific SNPs  twice as many that were only polymorphic in A  fraterculus when compared to A  obliqua and about 8 000 SNPs that segregate in both species  We focused on 389 contigs that had at least one fixed interspecific difference between the species and investigated for patterns of positive selection on these transcripts that resulted in 12 potentially interesting genes that express in the head and 15 reproductive genes that may be involved with species differences  among them serine proteases  odorant binding proteins as well as some uncharacterized proteins  These results provide us with a set of candidate genes that are potentially important to understand the evolution of genetic differences between A  obliqua and A  fraterculus 
 Shoot development  life history trade offs  and perenniality in Arabidopsis lyrata   Perenniality in plants can be interpreted in terms of the balance between production and consumption of meristems or other resources   Among perennials  this balance is manifest as trade offs between growth and reproduction   The perennial Arabidopsis lyrata is an ideal system for studying these processes due to its wide genetic variation in resource allocation and its close relationship to the annual A  thaliana   We previously found that resource allocation differences between divergent Norway and North Carolina populations result from cascading effects of QTLs affecting early development  and do not involve direct costs of reproduction   To investigate these developmental differences in more detail  we collected shoot development data on plants from both populations growing under controlled conditions   We hypothesized that trade offs occur under a simple model in which pre reproductive vegetative development of lateral meristems precluded reproductive transition during the same growing season   Instead  our results showed that individual shoots underwent vegetative to reproductive transitions  but Norway plants produced more rosette leaves per shoot before the reproductive transition than North Carolina plants   Plants producing more rosette leaves per shoot produced fewer inflorescences  and these effects were sufficient to explain the reduced reproductive output in Norway plants   These data suggest that trade offs result largely from delays in reproductive transition at the individual shoot level  involving allocation of limited growing season time rather than meristem fates per se   Implications for understanding local adaptation to climatic conditions will be discussed  
Phylogeography as context for adaptive change in Eurycea lucifuga              Understanding the phylogeographic history of a population can provide insight into the potential demographic changes that may impact current signatures of gene flow  as well as provide necessary context for inferences about trait evolution   We use phylogeographic inferences  as well as a reconstruction of the demographic history using mismatch analysis to test for signatures of recent expansion in a cave dwelling salamander  Eurycea lucifuga   Despite being exposed to strong selective pressures imposed by cave habitats  E  lucifuga does not exhibit the suite of classic morphological changes that has convergently evolved in most cave restricted taxa   Results suggest that colonization of caves in this species may be recent  and that while E  lucifuga may be responding to the selective pressure of caves  not enough time has passed for those changes to become apparent   This indicates the possibility that E  lucifuga may be in transition between the ancestral terrestrial morphology and a derived cave adapted state  
 Allopolyploidy  diversification  and the Miocene grassland expansion   Polyploidy s role in the diversification of plant species has long been a subject of debate  The identification of ancient whole genome duplication events in the green plant phylogeny  especially those occurring prior to major species radiations or the origin of novel phenotypes  has suggested that polyploidy may be a driving force in diversification   Alternatively  studies of more recent polyploid events have demonstrated that polyploid lineages may actually have lower rates of speciation relative to closely related diploid lineages  Furthermore  lineage diversification rates relative to WGD events corroborate the WGD Radiation Lag Time Model demonstrating that there is often an extensive period of time between a polyploid event and diversification  suggesting that polyploidy itself is not the driving force behind diversification   Here  we focus on the tribe Andropogoneae  subfamily Panicoideae  family Poaceae   a group of C4 grasses that include economically important species such as maize  sorghum  and sugarcane  as well as ecological dominants such as big bluestem  Andropogon gerardi   little bluestem  Schizachyrium scoparium   and yellow Indiangrass  Sorghastrum nutans    We reconstructed a phylogeny of approximately 10  of Andropogoneae species using four nuclear loci supported with a smaller sampling of full plastome sequences  We identified genetic allopolyploid events using nuclear gene trees that showed support from more than one locus  Our data suggest there were at least 28 independent tetraploid events encompassing 32  of the sampled species  Parental genomes of most polyploid species diverged during the late Miocene coincident with the expansion of the major C4 grasslands that dominate the earth today   Despite the ubiquity of polyploidy in the clade  only three lineages have undergone any major diversification since polyploidy  the Zea Tripsacum clade  the Bothriochloa Capillipedium Dicanthium clade  and the Miscanthus Saccharum clade   We conclude that  within Andropogoneae  polyploids are produced frequently  but only occasionally lead to increased diversification  
Intragenomic conflict over sex ratio in a moss  Population genetic theory is built on a foundation of Mendelian segregation  The success of this theory tells us that  in general  each allele at a heterozygous locus has an equal chance of being transmitted from one generation to the next  Striking exceptions to this generality are well known  in which nearly all of the offspring inherit a distorter allele  but these cases are seldom expected to be polymorphic  In contrast to this expectation  a few recent studies report subtle but persistent deviations from 1 1 meiotic segregation ratios in natural populations  suggesting that our knowledge of the distribution of segregation distortion may be biased toward strong drivers with major fitness effects  Here we generated meiotic sex ratio estimates for two populations of the dioecious moss Ceratodon purpureus  Using a general hierarchical likelihood model we found an overall male biased sex ratio and significant genetic variation for offspring sex ratio in both populations  Furthermore  we found a positive association between a male biased sex ratio and total spore production  pointing to a previously unexplored genetic correlation between meiotic sex ratio and resource allocation between maternal gametophytes and their nutritionally dependent offspring sporophytes  If frequent across the genome  weak distorters such as these could make a major contribution to the maintenance of polymorphism for fitness  the genomic architecture of recombination  and the evolution of reproductive isolation   
Estimating how contemporary taxa will evolve in the future to understand how island communities were assembled in the past  The ocean surrounding isolated islands forms a significant barrier to their successful colonization  Certain traits may assist dispersal to these islands  but getting there is this is only half the battle  organisms must also cope with the potentially novel environments in which they may find themselves  Nevertheless  it is clear that successful colonization of oceanic islands can result in dramatic and rapid radiations  both in terms of producing new species as well as in the novel physical phenotypes that often result  The most general explanation for these radiations is one of ecological opportunity  where species that disperse to a new island habitat with few competitors are thought to rapidly radiate to fill empty niches  Another possibility  however  is that only a peculiar subset of species actually possess the capability to radiate in this manner  and the process of dispersing and surviving filters only these species from a larger pool of potential immigrants  In other words  from a given pool of candidate species are the winners a random draw or is there something about their potential to evolve that allows them to succeed  Here we develop a set of novel techniques for quantifying and summarizing the evolutionary potential of contemporary species and test whether a speciesâ€™ inherent ability to evolve is an important component of the successful colonization of remote oceanic islands  We focus our attention on the species of the Hawaiian Islands  which are well known for exhibiting a tremendous amount of variation in phenotype as an apparent consequence of movements onto these islands  Our findings suggest that the inherent evolutionary potential of a species has played a critical role in the process of arriving and thriving on the Hawaiian Islands  Our study also highlights that when looking at which organisms thrive in a newly available set of niches  we should look at their underlying  intrinsic rate of innovation as well as their more obvious phenotypic states  In this way  evolutionary potential represents an important new measure about nature that may help explain global distribution of species  which taxa survived past extinction pulses  and those that are predisposed to thrive in the current one  
 Endocrine disrupting chemicals lead to higher order behavioral effects when they alter interacting phenotypes in guppies  Poecilia reticulata   Endocrine disrupting chemicals  EDCs  are a class of common environmental contaminants known to alter individual physiology and behavior  EDC exposure has many effects on the physiology of animals but one of the most striking is male feminization  Feminization of physiology is often accompanied by feminization of behavior  including reductions in boldness and or aggression and loss of mating displays  These behaviors place crucial roles in structuring social interactions among many animals  When social behaviors are influenced by interactions among conspecifics  they are termed  interacting phenotypes   Interacting phenotypes  traits that at least in part reflect an interaction with social partners  often result from indirect genetic effects  or the influences of genes carried in social partners on the behavior of a focal individual  These effects are mediated through the phenotype of the social partner  We hypothesized that exposure to endocrine disruptors could generate higher order behavioral effects  altering the behavior of untreated individuals through interactions with exposed individuals and or altering the social organization of whole groups  We measured the effects of EDC exposure in guppies  Poecilia reticulata  because guppies exhibit complex social behavior influenced by indirect genetic effects  In one experiment  social partners were exposed to one of two common EDCs  vinclozolin or bisphenol A and then allowed to interact with untreated focal individuals in the presence of a predator model  Focal behavior changes in response to treated partners compared to untreated partners for many aspects of cooperative antipredator behavior  In a second experiment  whole groups were exposed to vinclozolin and changes in social network structure were measured  Taken together  these data suggest that impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals at low and environmentally relevant doses can have far reaching effects  even on individuals that were unexposed  via the influence of social partners  
Immune memory drives the evolution of virulence  in an emergent wildlife pathogen  Accumulating experimental evidence from various host pathogen systems indicates that imperfect host immunity  by altering life history trade off structures between transmission duration and efficacy  plays an important role in shaping the evolution of pathogen virulence  However  examples from natural systems  and the theoretical foundations for understanding this outcome  are lacking  Here we report on experimental and modeling work of imperfect immune memory in the North American house finch to explain increases in the virulence of its bacterial pathogen  Mycoplasma gallisepticum  that have occurred following the pathogen s emergence  Our experimental work shows that host immune memory  induced by prior infection  introduces plasticity to trade offs  while modeling results confirm that the nature of these plastic changes can induce the evolution of higher optimal pathogen virulence  More generally  our findings can be used to better understand the mechanisms by which imperfect vaccination in humans may select for more virulent pathogens  In light of these potentially pathological outcomes  our findings further suggest a cautious approach to the design and utilization of imperfect vaccines against human pathogens  
Extending BAMM  a computer program for analyzing complex macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenetic trees  The phylogenetic history and the distribution of current phenotypes of a group of species has been shaped by sequences of past macroevolutionary events  These events may include changes in the rate of speciation  extinction  or phenotypic evolution  Events occur in various locations on a phylogenetic tree and each one has specific parameters  such as whether the speciation rate increased or decreased through time  BAMM is a computer program that identifies macroevolutionary events that have occurred in the phylogenetic history of a group of species  Here we describe extensions to the software that improve our ability to reconstruct complex histories of speciation  extinction  and phenotypic evolution  We also apply our software to an empirical phylogeny and propose ways in which our methods may be improved or extended  
 Paternal learning of a phenotype matching trait promotes speciation at secondary contact  but not the spread of a new local adaptation   Assortative mating can be an essential component of speciation with gene flow because it reduces genetic exchange between groups with different mating preferences  Assortative mating traits and or preferences have been found to be affected by learning across a wide range of animal taxa  yet how differences in the template for learning affect speciation has been largely overlooked  We investigate how migration  the template for learning  assortative mating strength  and divergent selection affect the divergence of a  trait that can be affected by learning  and is used as a cue for mate choice by self referent phenotype matching  We found that oblique and maternal learning masks sexual selection and therefore does not facilitate the maintenance of divergence  Paternal learning can maintain divergence at a level higher than does genetic inheritance  The establishment of divergence through the spread of novel adaptations is however hindered by paternal learning  This is because paternal learning enhances positive frequency dependent sexual selection  which makes it easier to lose polymorphism  
Fitness Effects of Cell to Cell Expression Heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  A small fraction of proteins show significant cell to cell heterogeneity in their expression levels among clonal  well mixed Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells  It is known that the fitness effects of variation in protein expression levels among populations of cells are highly nonlinear  cells may be tolerant to wide variation in the expression level of a protein  or sensitive to even small changes  However  the consequences of cell to cell expression differences have not been widely studied  Here  we separate populations of cells into fractions expressing high  medium  and low levels of a single gene at a time  based on the intensity of a fused fluorescent tag  We find that extreme cell to cell heterogeneity in the expression level of highly expressed proteins results in dramatic differences in cellular growth rate  We also assess growth patterns of heterogeneous cells across various stress environments in order to evaluate the hypothesis that these differences in growth rate  as well as the underlying heterogeneity in protein expression  are part of a bet hedging strategy  In bet hedging  individuals within a population take on phenotypic states that are sub optimal in the current environment  but well suited to other commonly encountered environments  thereby increasing the overall fitness of the population in the face of environmental change  
Public Threshold Game  A New Game to Model Social Behavior in Animals  The evolution of cooperation has been a conundrum in evolutionary biology because cooperation is vulnerable to selfish cheaters  One example of this dilemma is the  tragedy of the commons   where individuals can either contribute to a public good or abstain  Since the public good is distributed to everyone regardless of an investment or not  those individuals who abstain will always fare better  unless the public goods multiplier  the synergy  is unrealistically high  While it is possible in principle to enforce cooperation via costly punishment  we found that even though punishment shifts the cooperation regime to emerge at lower synergy thresholds  individuals evolve to become pure cooperators who do not need to punish  This means that the threat of punishment alone is sufficient to drive cooperation  while actual punishment is rare  On the contrary  in natural systems we often observe vigorous punishment  Another difference between the public goods game and  some  natural systems and is that in the public goods game the payoff is a linear function of the amount paid in  while in natural systems often a threshold determines how much individuals need to contribute in order to obtain a fixed payoff that does not depend on the number of contributors who ultimately trigger it  more wolves hunting in a pack does not increase the size of the moose  you either get the moose or you don t   To remedy these discrepancies between the public goods game and the game theoretic dilemma observed for example in collective hunting strategies  we introduce the  public thresh  old game  as an extension to public good game where a fixed payoff is distributed equally once enough individuals cooperate  number of contributors ³ threshold   This alteration changes the game dramatically  Here  if the investment in the public good exceeds a given threshold  everyone  contributors as well as cheaters  receives an equal share  R n   where R and n is the fixed payoff and the number players in the game respectively  while if the investment does not reach the threshold  the investment is lost  We find that effective punishment emerges as a stable strategy in this game  which in return facilitates cooperation  This suggests that the  public threshold game  is a better model for natural gambles that are  all or nothing   and in which the triggered payoff does not depend in a linear fashion on the number of investors   
 Mating tactics of the female mimic morph of the ruff sandpiper  a bird with permanent genetic mating strategies   Female mimics  Faeders  represent a rare third permanent genetic male morph of the ruff sandpiper Philomachus pugnax alongside ornamented Independent and Satellite morphs   Displaying Independent males are territorial on the lek  and displaying Satellite males move among territories   However  Faeders have largely evaded detection on leks  none has been observed to mate in the wild   The introduction of wild caught Faeders into a captive colony provided the opportunity to observe their unique mating tactics   Observations were restricted to a period each morning when displaying males were introduced into an aviary housing Faeders and females   Faeders are not chased by territorial males  and remain close to the most actively displaying male s    Faeders sneaked copulations by quickly responding to crouching females   Faeders interrupted matings by attempting to insert themselves between males mounting receptive females   Their female like plumage enabled them act as decoys luring males away from receptive females   Some females selected Faeders as mates  soliciting copulation in the absence of displaying males   Half of the sons of Faeders inherit the Faeder morph  and adult Faeder sons have been observed using some of the same tactics   Inheritance patterns indicate that the morph is specified by a single autosomal locus with a dominant Faeder allele  likely in an epistatic interaction with the Satellite locus  Lank et al  2013  Biol  Lett     The Faeder locus has recently been mapped  Farrell et al  2013  BMC Genomics    The unique male mating behavior described here complements a suite of phenotypic characteristics of Faeders including reduction in body size and lack of male ornamental plumage  
 Hit the Road  Chuck   Evolution Education Goes Mobile With The Darwin Day Roadshow   To celebrate Charles Darwin s birthday each year  the scientists and educators of NESCent  The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  hit the road to bring evolutionary science to schools  museums and town halls in communities around the country  via a program called The Darwin Day Roadshow   We are particularly interested in reaching out to small rural communities which would not otherwise have a Darwin Day celebration  as well as communities with high numbers of under represented minority students   Our teams talk to students  teachers and the general public about their research in evolutionary science and discuss the rewards and challenges of science careers   Prior to hitting the road  all of our scientists participate in professional development workshops focused on effectively communicating evolution to the public   The host teachers take an active role in working with us to plan the visits  and in return each host teacher receives a large collection of evolution teaching resources to support their continued teaching of evolution in engaging  dynamic ways   To date  we have visited thousands of students and teachers in twenty two states   The Darwin Day Roadshow not only exposes students  teachers and the general public to cutting edge evolutionary science  and valuable information on science careers   but provides novel outreach experiences and professional development opportunities for NESCent scientists  
Breaking G  Variable pleiotropy and environmentally induced changes in the correlated response to selection  Selection in novel environments can lead to a coordinated evolutionary response across a suite of characters  However  environmental conditions can also affect the genetic architecture of complex traits  which in principle can alter the pattern of the multivariate response to selection  We describe a factorial selection experiment in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei in which two different stress related phenotypes were selected under three different environmental conditions   In each case  the pattern of covariation in the evolutionary response among traits differed depending on the environment in which selection occurred  including asymmetrical responses to selection in some cases  This suggests variation in pleiotropy across the stress response network that is highly sensitive to the external environment  These results highlight the complexity of the interaction between genes and environment that influences the ability of organisms to acclimate to novel environments  as well as the need to identify the underlying genetic basis of genetic correlations in order understand how patterns of pleiotropy are distributed across complex genetic networks  
Constraints on the evolution of sex biased gene expression in Drosophila serrata  Sexual antagonism is an inevitable phenomenon arising from sex specific selection on genetically correlated traits  The evolution of sex biased gene expression is one mechanism that may alleviate sexual antagonism  Although sex biased transcripts are common  it is unclear whether extant levels of sexual dimorphism reflect fully or only partially resolved sexual conflicts  or have arisen via other evolutionary processes  While positive genetic covariances between the sexes may generate considerable constraint to the evolution of sexually dimorphic gene expression  further constraints likely arise due to the multidimensional nature of gene expression  For example  sex specific responses to selection depend not only genetic  co variances between genes within a sex  but also genetic covariances between genes  both within and between the sexes  for many other genes  To examine the extent of these constraints  we have assayed sex specific fitness and genetic  co variation in gene expression in a panel of 40 wild derived lines of Drosophila serrata  
Fins as highly integrated building blocks promoting fish morphological disparity  Among fishes  actinopterygians have achieved a phenomenal ecological and evolutionary success  this group includes approximately 30 000 living species as well as an abundant fossil record  No less impressive is the extent of morphological disparity that can be observed among them  notably in terms of fin configurations  which includes position  size and shape  The diversity of fin morphologies might have been facilitated by a modular organization  As such  fins could constitute highly integrated sub units that behave quasi independently during ontogeny or evolution  making these structures evolvable and therefore explaining the observed patterns of morphological disparity  Several morphological  e g   dorsal anal fin positioning module   developmental  e g   dorsal anal and pectoral pelvic patterning modules  and functional modules have already been proposed for median and paired fins  Using geometric morphometrics  we investigate the positional modularity of fins by analyzing patterns of morphological integration  More precisely  the aim is to establish which subsets of fins are quasi independent and which are most highly integrated in terms of their positioning on the fish s body  We have focused on two cyprinid species  the zebrafish  Danio rerio   a commonly used model organism  and the northern redbelly dace  Chrosomus eos   for which specimens come from a single lacustrine population  Several hypotheses of modularity were tested  including those based on functional demands  topological relationships  or previous results from a broad scaled phylogenetic analysis focusing on the correlated presence absence of fins  Hypotheses were evaluated using a combination of methods  e g   minimum deviance method  matrix correlations  graphical modeling   Preliminary results suggest that if parts of the body and fins are constrained to belong to a single module  the best fitting models for both D  rerio and C  eos are those that predict that dorsal  anal and caudal fins constitute an integrated unit  In these preferred models  the paired fins are variably associated with either the head region or with the other median fins  This commonality suggests that patterns of integration and modularity are not species specific but are rather phylogenetically conserved  Removing the constraints on the models  however  reveals that these integrated units preserve significant associations to other regions of the fish s body  
Species selection and evolving traits can and do interact  Species selection is a higher level version of natural selection  where speciation and extinction rates covary with phenotypic or macroecological properties of species  Species selection acts on species  properties without regard for how those properties are produced or how the species containing those properties are related  In contrast  the macroevolutionary response to selection  depends on the structure of the properties phylogenetic variation among species in the clade and on how that variation is produced over species  lifetimes  This means that the response to species selection is governed by both microevolutionary phyletic and phylogenetic change  For species selection to generate large scale trends  both species selection and the macroevolutionary response to species selection must align in a concordant way  But the interaction between selection and the response to selection can be complex  For example  if species selection is strong but orthogonal to microevolutionary change  the resultant is an equilibrium non trend  where the average trait values among species are stable over time  Non trends are interesting because if selection or the response to selection are considered only in isolation  strong directional trends are expected  What matters for any given selection and response regime is the resultant vector produced by the vector of selection and the vector of response to selection This framework lends itself to studying the evolution of a wide variety of trait distributions  Many traits often change over the lifetime of species and also show highly variable phylogenetic signal  For example  geographic range size is consistently associated with extinction selectivity  yet range size changes dramatically over the lifetimes of species as well as over phylogeny  What this framework provides is a means to understand how changes to trait distributions are made  How much change is due to selectivity or due to phyletic change  How do these inferred changes interact with each other to produce the total change in the distributions of traits  The answers to these questions show how macroevolution is more than microevolution scaled up over deep time  Cladogenesis and extinction together add new levels evolutionary processes that make up the major features of macroevolution  
Phylogenomics of Amphibia  Myriad genomic advances are now allowing unprecedented resolution of many challenging questions in Evolutionary Biology and among them  targeted sequence capture is becoming a popular approach for gathering gene sequence data across large numbers of taxa  In this talk  I will discuss our ongoing efforts to develop and implement methods for generating phylogenomic data by anchored hybrid enrichment in amphibians which confront challenges posed by both extreme variation in genome size and by deep evolutionary divergences between lineages  Primary goals of this work are to broadly sample representatives of each major amphibian lineage  to collect hundreds of orthologous loci for coalescent species tree estimation  and to test hypotheses about the relationships between rates of amphibian lineage diversification and rates of molecular evolution across the genome  
The facultative symbiont Rickettsia protects whiteflies against cryptic Pseudomonas syringae pathogens  Facultative endosymbionts can benefit insect hosts in specific contexts  such as by protecting hosts against pathogens  It may be difficult to know how facultative symbionts are benefiting hosts in some populations  especially in the case of protection from cryptic pathogens  The sweet potato whitefly  Bemisia tabaci   an invasive agricultural pest  can possess facultative endosymbionts of the genus Rickettsia  Rickettsia is common in some whitefly populations where it improves host fitness in ways that are not entirely known  We investigated the interaction of a recently discovered cryptic pathogen of hemipteran insects  the common epiphytic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae  with whiteflies and Rickettsia  To determine if Rickettsia can protect whiteflies against cryptic pathogens  we tested whitefly lines with identical nuclear genetic backgrounds  but differing in Rickettsia infection status  for mortality after oral exposure to the pathogen  Sweet potato whiteflies became infected with P  syringae in either in vitro feeding assays or by feeding on plants painted with the bacteria  The bacteria multiplied in the insects and caused very high mortality  80 90   within four days  The presence of Rickettsia provided whiteflies some protection against the pathogen  slowing the rate of death  The impact of Rickettsia was most pronounced at low infection levels from on plant exposure  suggesting that the interaction could be significant under natural conditions  Little is known about how insects and most environmental bacteria  including P  syringae  interact  Pseudomonas syringae is a common plant pathogen and is widely found on plant surfaces so it could have significant impacts on whitefly populations  These results also suggest that Rickettsia may benefit hosts by protecting against cryptic pathogens  which could contribute to the prevalence of Rickettsia in some populations  
The molecular basis of gene by environment interaction in Arabidopsis thaliana  Individuals in natural populations vary considerably in their response to the environment  Although widely observed at the phenotypic level  until recently these variable responses  or Genotype by Environment Interactions  GEI   have been challenging to dissect at the molecular level  Detailed molecular work in a small number of reference genotypes has begun to assemble the cellular toolkit of organismal response to environmental perturbations  It remains unclear  however  which of these components vary in natural populations  and how selection acts on different stages of regulatory network hierarchies  We present evidence from two experiments which show that both cis  and trans acting natural variants drive regulatory variation in a plant hormone signaling network  First  we use transgenic analysis to demonstrate that two intermediate frequency natural alleles in a core signaling protein drive different sets of downstream transcriptional targets in response to environmental cues  These data suggest a role for trans acting variation in GEIs  We next use a population genomic approach to demonstrate that natural variation in a particular transcription factor binding motif is associated with natural variation in expression response to environmental cues  These data suggest a role for cis acting variation in GEIs  Collectively  these data reveal the complex genetic architecture of plant environment interaction  and suggest that natural populations contain abundant functional genetic variation in environmentally responsive molecular machinery  
When field experiments yield unexpected results  Lessons learned from measuring selection in White Sands lizards  Determining the adaptive significance of phenotypic traits is key for understanding the ecology and evolution of natural populations  However  evolutionary biologists have an incomplete understanding of how specific characteristics affect fitness in most natural populations  The White Sands system provides an opportunity for studying the adaptive significance of specific traits in an experimental context  Blanched dorsal color evolved recently in populations of three species of lizards inhabiting the gypsum dunes of White Sands  and is likely an adaptation for crypsis to avoid avian predation  To determine whether there is a relationship between body color and susceptibility to predation in White Sands lizards  we conducted enclosure experiments at White Sands  We quantified survivorship of lizards exhibiting substrate matched and substrate mismatched color phenotypes  We found evidence that lizards experienced strong predation in White Sands  Body color did not have a significant effect on survival  but we found several unexpected relationships including variation in predation over extremely small spatial and temporal scales  In addition  we detected a marginally significant interaction between sex and color that impacted survivorship  suggesting that selection for substrate matching may be stronger for males than females  We use our results as a case study to examine six major categories of challenges frequently encountered in field based studies of natural selection  and suggest that insight into the complexities of selection is often obtained when experiments turn out differently than expected   
Individual variation in the gut microbiome of mushroom feeding Drosophila  Just like all animals  the insect body is teeming with microorganims that form complex communities that affect many aspects of host biology  The species composition of the microbiota is thought to be environmentally acquired in most insects  excluding social insects that can transmit bacteria between generations  Insects are commonly infected with endosymbiotic bacteria and parasites that may influence the composition of the gut microbiota  Drosophila is a genus that includes an abundance of ecologically varied species  specifically in Upstate New York there are several specialist species that can subsist on toxic mushrooms  It has been proposed that the gut bacteria aid in detoxification of amanitin toxins present in their diet  Here we screen the bacterial microbiota of individual flies from the mushroom feeding species  D  putrida  D  falleni  and D  neotestacea  Geographic and temporal collections allow us to identify individual microbiota variation  host restricted bacteria  and interactions with endosymbionts  i e  Wolbachia and Spiroplasma  or parasites  i e  nematode and trypanosomatid   By sampling individuals that differ in infection status we reveal the interaction between their microbiome and diet  
 Invade  co opt  and swap   Evolution of G1 S cell cycle control in Fungi and other eukaryotes   The core eukaryotic cell cycle is believed to have emerged before the last common ancestor of plants  fungi  and animals   The structure of the G1 S regulatory network that regulates cell cycle entry and its dynamic properties are highly similar in budding yeast and mammals despite lack of sequence homology between many G1 S regulators  cyclins  transcription factors  and inhibitors   This is all the more striking because plant and animal G1 S regulators  Cyclin D  E2F DP  Rb  have much higher sequence homology even though fungi and animals are more closely related   This suggests that plants and animals have conserved both the components and the network structure of the ancestral G1 S network  while more dramatic cell cycle evolution occurred in Fungi 
Evolution of the Tissue Specificity of Inherited Predispositions to Cancer  Studies of familial cancers have found that only a small subset of tissues are affected by inherited mutations in a given tumor suppressor  TSG  or proto oncogene  POG   even though the mutation is present in all tissues  The tissue specificity of these genes suggests that each gene is acting as a critical regulator of cell division in the predisposed tissues but not in those tissues with no elevated risk of hereditary cancer  This suggestion  however  has been difficult to support  Studies investigating the presence vs  absence of gene and protein expression have found that TSGs and POGs are expressed in nearly every type of normal human tissue  Recent work  however  suggests that it is a high vs  low level of TSG or POG expression that may predict the importance of each gene across different tissue types   In this study  we test the hypothesis that TSGs and POGs have higher constitutive expression in the normal  non cancerous  tissues where they are implicated in familial cancers  relative to those tissues where they are not  We examined microarray expression levels of 15 TSGs and 8 POGs across 12 human tissue types and found a significant difference between expression levels in susceptible vs  non susceptible tissues  We found the target gene to have its highest expression level in the corresponding susceptible tissue s  for 5  33   of the TSGs  p 0 02  and 5  62 5   of the POGs  p 0 0004  examined  This is the first study to report such findings in gene expression data  We conclude by discussing possible explanations as to why this pattern is not detected in a greater proportion of the genes and suggest new research directions that can be explored using this approach   
The Effect of Parasites on the Ability of Self Fertilization to Invade Outcrossing Host Populations  The ubiquity of biparental reproduction in nature poses an important problem in evolutionary biology because substantial fitness costs are associated with biparental reproduction relative to uniparental reproduction  A two fold cost of biparental reproduction  in species that maintain separate sexes  results from the inability of males to directly produce their own offspring  Given this fitness deficit  populations that reproduce biparentally should be susceptible to invasion by mutants that reproduce uniparentally  The Red Queen Hypothesis  RQH  is based on this advantage  and predicts that coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites can generate negative frequency dependent selection favoring rapid changes in host genotype frequencies  We tested the hypothesis that coevolutionary interactions with parasites can prevent self fertilization from invading obligately outcrossing host populations  We introduced wild type Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites  capable of both outcrossing and self fertilization  into C  elegans populations genetically manipulated to reproduce exclusively by outcrossing  Replicate C  elegans populations were experimentally evolved under 3 parasite treatment regimes  In the control treatment  1  hosts were exposed to avirulent heat killed Serratia marcescens bacteria  In the fixed parasite genotype treatment  2  hosts were exposed every generation to the same isogenic stock population of the highly virulent S  marcescens parasite  In the recycled parasite treatment  3  C  elegans hosts were exposed every generation to coevolving S  marcescens  The male frequency of replicate host populations was measured over 33 host generations  and used to estimate the frequency of self fertilization in host populations  We found that self fertilization rapidly invaded host populations evolving in the control environment  Self fertilization remained rare initially  and then rapidly invaded host populations evolving in the fixed parasite genotype treatment  However  self fertilization rates remained low throughout the entire experiment in the recycled parasite treatment host populations  Our results support the Red Queen Hypothesis  and suggest that coevolutionary interactions with a virulent parasite can prevent self fertilization from invading obligately outcrossing host populations  
Indirect genetic effects of FRIGIDA in Arabidopsis thaliana  Most research into the effects of genes on phenotypic development has focused on directly mapping the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation  Less is known about indirect genetic effects  which occur when the genes of one organism affect the phenotype of another  Previous studies demonstrated that FRIGIDA  FRI   a gene traditionally associated with flowering time  can affect the phenotype of a single neighboring plant  In this study we use four genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana  Columbia with and without FRI and Landsberg erecta with and without FRI  to better understand the ways in which the genetic composition of the social environment can shape plant development  Using a full factorial design  we examine how the genotype of genetically identical partner plants influences the development of a focal plant  We also investigate the relationship between the direct and indirect effects of FRI on reproductive and non reproductive traits  including flowering time  fruit number  rosette size and height  Preliminary results suggest that the presence of FRI in partner plants delays the development of focal plants  Results will be presented in full and their implications for understanding Arabidopsis evolution will be discussed  
Courtship Pheromone Evolution in Dusky Salamanders  The biological world is rich with sounds  smells  and movements that serve as communication signals  and demonstrate the evolution of life  Conspecific mate recognition signals can delimit species boundaries and structure communities  However  signals and mate choice are evolutionarily labile  and few studies have examined the impact of signal discordance on lineage diversification in adaptive radiations  Salamanders produce a cocktail of proteinaceous courtship pheromones which are highly variable  Since these signals are encoded in the genome  their inheritance and patterns of divergence  convergence  and introgression can be readily analyzed in a phylogenetic and molecular evolution context  Dusky salamanders of the genus Desmognathus are endemic to eastern North America  and display dramatic disparity in ecology  body size and life history  However  some distantly related species are highly convergent in these traits  and behavioral studies have shown varying degrees of prezygotic isolation among divergent  yet ecologically similar species  In this study  we analyze the transcripts of pheromone genes in Desmognathus  and test patterns of molecular evolution and selection   
Evolution of an integrated sexual display  genomic analysis of behavioral and morphological components of courtship song in a Hawaiian cricket  Conspicuous sexual displays commonly involve the tightly coordinated expression of morphology  physiology  and behavior  Predicting the evolutionary trajectories of such phenotypes requires knowledge of the functional relationships that link these different components to sexual trait variation  Moreover  components may differ in evolutionary lability due to distinct genetic architectures  In this study we describe the functional morphology of song production of male Hawaiian swordtail crickets  Second  we use genomic approaches to identify QTL for morphological and behavior components of song that has diverged between two closely related species  We discuss the results in relation to patterns of sexual trait diversification that have accompanied the Laupala species radiation  
Pathogen Host Interactions within Freshwater Systems  Bacteriophages play crucial roles in the maintenance of microbial communities  their impact far extending to the environments in which they are found  Their predation  however  drives bacterial species evolution  and thus the coevolutionary battle begins  In an effort to catch a glimpse into this dynamic system  bacterial and viral species were isolated from the Chicago nearshore waters of Lake Michigan  Using next generation sequencing  taxa and coding regions present were predicted  The two sites frequently showed comparable bacterial compositions on a collection date  although the presence and relative abundance of each taxon varied over time  While the most prolific and ubiquitous species on earth  a very small fraction of bacteriophages have been characterized and sequenced  BLAST based analyses of our environmental phage metagenomes repeatedly uncovered novel putative protein sequences  providing a glimpse   albeit narrow   into the phage species present  Correlations between phage and their bacterial host species were observed  Furthermore  composition based analysis of the viral contigs assembled offers insight into possible host species for uncharacterized phage species  
Genome wide evidence of genetic associations in eclosion timing in Rhagoletis fruit fly host races  Seasonal timing of reproduction is a key selective trait that drives ecological speciation in phytophagous insects  The apple maggot fly  Rhagoletis pomonella  Diptera  Tephritidae   provides a textbook example  with ancestral hawthorn infesting host races eclosing later than a recently evolved host race that infests earlier fruiting apples  We have identified a suite of RADseq genetic markers that strongly associate with both eclosion timing and host race differentiation  Largely overlapping sets of loci control the trait in both host races  though the data suggest that the genetic basis of early eclosion timing may not be straightforward  potentially requiring a rearrangement or modification of formerly adaptive linkage relationships  
Exploring diversification rates in the monocot family Araceae at different taxonomical scales  Araceae is one of the most diverse monocot families with about 3500 described species  is particularly abundant in the tropics  and exhibits a remarkable morphological  anatomical  ecological  and geographical variation  Despite several recent phylogenetic studies  we still know rather little about the dynamics of lineage and species diversification across the family  or about the underlying drivers of diversification  Here  we used a fossil calibrated Bayesian relaxed clock phylogeny from a previous analysis  134 taxa   a  supermatrix   with about 700 taxa   and a new dataset for the species rich subfamily Monsteroideae  ca  100 taxa  to explore how we might approach these questions  First  we combine BiSSE birth death models of diversification  MEDUSA  and a new Bayesian approach  BAMM   to evaluate the evolutionary patterns of species diversification in the family as a whole and for Monsteroideae  Preliminary analyses reveal dissimilar clade specific processes that allowed for species diversification in the family  We reviewed the abundant literature about morphological and ecological traits in Araceae  and discussed possible explanations for shifts in diversification traits in terms of extrinsic factors or intrinsic trait evolution  We studied in more detail  rates associated with transitions to and from water associated life forms  to more extreme aquatics  to strictly rheophytic  or toward dry land geophytes and epiphytism of various kinds  Second  using literature  herbarium specimens  and field observations  we compiled a morpho anatomical dataset for the subfamily Monsteroideae comprising 10 vegetative and ca  25 floral characters  We studied the evolution of these traits using ancestral state reconstruction  tried to associate them with shifts in diversification  We consider that better sampled phylogenies that cover broad taxonomic and geographic  and which are inferred from many genes  are promising for more accurate and precise modeling of rate shifts across aroids  In addition  assembly of equally densely sampled morphological  geographical and ecological datasets will be needed to properly test associations between these factors and clades showing different rates of species diversification  
Reassessing natural selection patterns and shapes in the wild  the case of an honest insect signal  A key assumption in sexual selection theory is that further elaboration of a sexually selected trait  SST  will be constrained by survival  However  assessing such cost in the wild has been problematic as  a  longevity has been frequently computed as the last day the individual was recorded in the field  b  if imperfect detection is not included explicitly in survival analyses  longevity estimates are going to be biased  being the bias more extreme in less detected individuals  i e females  alternative male morphs   c  previous studies have not included other traits than the SST in question  that may also contribute to fitness  We have solved these drawbacks using modern mark recapture techniques entering imperfect detection and other traits that correlate with the expression of a SST  For this  we studied survival effects of an exaggerated SST  wing spot  and a related non SST  wing length  in calopterygid adults in the wild  Size of wing spots in calopterygids is sexually selected and is an honest indicator of condition in terms of physiology and survival  These findings  however  have been somehow confounded by a correlation between wing spot and wing length  Here we show that control and experimental individuals with an increased wing spot area in both sexes present a lower survival probability which illustrates a natural selection constrain for exaggerated SST expression  Furthermore  we also found a significant effect of dismissing imperfect detection and individual heterogeneity in survival and recapture rates via simulation  being the bias higher in females  Finally  we demonstrate a linear selection acting on wing spot area but not on wing size or correlational selection between both variables  Our work not only clarifies that a survival cost exists for an exaggerated SST  but that such cost and imperfect detection should be properly analyzed in evolutionary studies  
Evolution of ecological dominance of yeast species in high sugar environments  Ecological dominance is an important component of species diversity and is a key feature of invasive species  While a number of ecological factors are known to be important for dominance to occur  dominance may also depend on genetic changes that increase fitness in certain environments  To understand the evolution of dominance  it is important to know when species evolved the ability to dominate and which strategies they employ  In the vineyard  the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominates multiple other species as grape juice ferments to wine  One strategy that may enable S  cerevisiae to dominate is its predominately fermentative lifestyle  which is expected to be advantageous in high sugar environments like grape juice  However  this trait evolved at or around a whole genome duplication  WGD  shared by other yeast species  some of which are dominated by S  cerevisiae in grape juice  To determine when ecological dominance in grape juice evolved in the yeast lineage  we quantified the relative abundance of multiple pre  and post WGD yeast species following growth in co culture with S  cerevisiae in two high sugar environments  high sugar rich medium and grape juice  S  cerevisiae was able to dominate nearly all other pre  and post WGD yeast species in both high sugar environments except for its sibling species  S  paradoxus  indicating a recent evolution on the lineage that gave rise to S  cerevisiae and S  paradoxus  To test whether inherent growth differences could explain the dominance of S  cerevisiae  we measured the intrinsic growth rate of each yeast species grown in monoculture in both high sugar environments  During monoculture  all yeast species grew as well as S  cerevisiae in high sugar rich medium  while the majority of species grew slower than S  cerevisiae in grape juice  These results indicate that multiple mechanisms contribute to the dominance of S  cerevisiae in high sugar environments  To further examine the phenotypic basis of S  cerevisiae s growth advantage  we measured the intrinsic growth rate of each yeast species in response to ethanol  low pH  and nutrient supplements  S  cerevisiae grew significantly better than multiple other yeast species in response to ethanol and low pH  and generally  S  cerevisiae did not benefit from additional nutrient supplements while the growth of many other species was enhanced  Overall  our results indicate that multiple traits contribute to S  cerevisiaes dominance in grape juice and that many of these traits arose recently and are not associated with the shift to a fermentative lifestyle associated with the WGD  
 Co Option of an RNA Binding Protein in the Translational Regulation of a Hypervariable Vertebrate Pheromone  Plethodontid Modulating Factor   For more than 100 million years  plethodontid salamanders have utilized a complex mixture of proteinaceous courtship pheromones to regulate reproductive behavior and mating success  One component  Plethodontid Modulating Factor  PMF   is a hypervariable pheromone related to the three finger superfamily  The diversity of PMF isoforms varies among plethodontid salamanders  with some species  such as Plethodon shermani  expressing more than 30 distinct PMFs of  30  average amino acid similarity  These complex isoform mixtures are the products of gene duplication and positive selection  However  despite rapid evolution of the coding regions  the untranslated regions  UTRs  are  98  conserved and maintained by purifying selection  This form of disjunctive evolution was hypothesized to permit expansion of PMF s functional breadth while providing a mechanism to regulate simultaneous expression of the many isoforms  In order to identify possible regulatory proteins that bind the UTRs  transcriptome analyses were performed on developing P  shermani glands and analyzed for putative RNA binding proteins  From  55 000 assembled contigs  the only major candidate identified was Cold Inducible RNA Binding Protein  CIRBP   Binding and kinetics assays revealed that CIRBP cooperatively binds the PMF 3  UTR  Gene expression was negatively correlated between CIRBP and PMF  at both mRNA and protein levels   Thus  CIRBP was hypothesized to be a negative regulator of pheromone expression by influencing mRNA stability and or rates of translation  and was postulated to be the proximate cause of purifying selection on the PMF UTRs  As a  cold inducible  protein  CIRBP may play a critical role s  in the translational regulation of PMF expression during pheromone gland development  and as global climate change alters seasonal temperatures  the regulation of this protein may have profound impacts on reproduction in these cold blooded animals  
Expanding radiation of Lialis burtonis during Australias aridification during the Tertiary period  Much of the endemic biodiversity of Australia arose during the aridification of the continent at the end of the Tertiary period  This caused contractions of mesic biota to refugia  However  new adaptive zones opened up spurring range expansion and diversification in arid adapted lineages  Using Burton s legless lizard  Lialis burtonis  as a model  we illustrate the dynamics these climatic events had on gene flow  biogeography  and speciation on L  burtonis  These geckos cover a wide expanse throughout Australia and portions of Papua New Guinea among many habitats  covering both tropical and arid biomes  L  burtonis is an effective model to understand how extrinsic environmental and intrinsic genealogical factors affect the biogeography and gene flow across a large area  L  burtonis may shed light on the origin for colonization during this aridfication  Sequencing of ND2 yields 4 distinct clades  a large arid clade sister to the Pilbara clade and two wet region clades  sister to one another   one to the northern monsoon region and one to the Eastern portion of the continent  The use of restriction site associated DNA sequencing  RADseq  show distinct populations that corroborate phylogenetic analysis  Relative genetic mixing is low between populations  This study demonstrates the varied responses to aridification in Australia including localized persistence of lineages in the tropical monsoonal biome  
Characterization of Amphibian Species Specific Cutaneous Bacterial Communities and Metabolites  Amphibians have become the most threatened class of animals in the world  with over 30  of all known species at risk of extinction  Most species suffer from the effects of multiple major threats  including climate change  habitat destruction  pollution  and disease  Among the most destructive of these forces is chytridiomycosis  a fungal disease that has spread globally in the past few decades  now implicated in the recent rapid disappearance and likely extinction of many species across North and South America  Recent research suggests some species may have evolved resistance to such fungal skin pathogens via anti fungal metabolites produced by skin bacteria  Future conservation efforts may rely heavily upon knowledge of this relationship  with possible transmission of beneficial microbial resistance to threatened populations  We sought to characterize the metabolite profiles and bacterial communities of amphibian species from Bioko Island  Equatorial Guinea  Species in this region of Africa appear to carry chytridiomycosis infection  but do not succumb to the disease  suggesting possible resistance  Results indicate the presence of anti fungal bacteria and metabolites  and principal coordinate analysis shows strong clustering of bacteria metabolite  Bac Met  profiles by species  These results may help advise ongoing conservation efforts  and may also provide insights into the role of bacteria in amphibian evolution and speciation  Future research will focus on the specific mechanisms of this apparent symbiosis  and the extent of this observed Bac Met profile relationship with species across greater geographic distances and additional taxa  
Strong premating reproductive isolation contributes to incipient speciation in Mimulus aurantiacus  Determining which forms of reproductive isolation have the biggest impact on the process of divergence is a major goal of speciation research  These barriers are often divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization  premating isolation   and those that occur after mating has occurred  postmating isolation   and much debate has surrounded the relative importance of these categories  Within the species Mimulus aurantiacus  red  and yellow flowered ecotypes occur in the southwest corner of California  We show that these two taxa are largely separated by ecogeographic isolation  with the red flowered ecotype occupying relatively benign habitats near the coast  and the yellow flowered ecotype inhabiting harsher inland environments  Along a narrow zone of contact  additional reproductive barriers have the potential to limit gene flow  and in these locations  differential visitation by pollinators provides strong but incomplete isolation  We show that postmating forms of reproductive isolation have little or no impact on gene flow  therefore  premating barriers are solely responsible for divergence  Structure analysis reveals that these premating barriers are sufficient to delineate taxa genetically  however  analysis of molecular variation across thousands of RAD seq markers shows that the genomes of these taxa are largely undifferentiated  These data suggest that two forms of ecologically based divergent selection are contributing to incipient speciation in these taxa  and the interaction between these two independent agents may be necessary to maintain stable phenotypic differentiation in the face of ongoing gene flow  
Evolution of Body Size and Sexual Size Dimorphism in Two Replicated Lizards Radiations  The iguanian lizard clades Phrynosomatinae in North America and Liolaemini from southern South America share many similarities in their ecological  physiological  and morphological diversity  Specifically  both groups occupy a variety of microhabitats on their respective continents  but without the predictable ecomorphological relationships demonstrated by Caribbean Anolis or extreme size variation found in monitor lizards  Varanus   However  both groups contain multiple independent origins of viviparity and within Liolaemini over half of the more than 270 species have live birth  This study will explore evolutionary patterns of male and female body size and sexual size dimorphism  SSD  to identify whether particular lineages within each of those groups have exhibited exceptional rate shifts in body size or SSD  If such shifts are identified  we will then determine if they are associated with changes in other phenotypic traits  such as reproductive mode or occupation of a specific microhabitat  We also will evaluate whether the use of two alternative treatments of body size  maximum size vs  mean size  has a significant impact on inferences made using these methods  
Tracing the diversification of prorhynchid flatworms with cDNA enriched genome libraries  Methods to efficiently exploit high throughput sequencing to generate taxon rich phylogenetic datasets at intermediate scales of divergence  i e   those between closely related species and genera  remain somewhat limited and resource intensive  Ironically  this is also the scale at which most systematic research is conducted  and at which complexities such as introgression and incomplete lineage sorting   which strictly require data from many unlinked loci to detect and model   are expected to be most relevant  We discuss ongoing experiments to generate such data for a   typical   species level phylogenetic study  Our system of interest is Prorhynchida  a clade of mostly inconspicuous   1 2 mm  non model flatworms  Platyhelminthes  with unique reproductive biology  known from freshwater and terrestrial habitats worldwide  Twenty nine valid prorhynchid species have been named  but undescribed species greatly outnumber these  and no well justified phylogeny of Prorhynchida has been put forward  We have achieved a thorough taxon sampling of approximately 50 prorhynchid species in all known genera  and generated a preliminary estimate of their phylogeny using a Sanger dataset amplified from genomic DNA  however  many key relationships remain recalcitrant in our analyses of these data  justifying further study  To this end  we present a novel approach designed to efficiently sequence orthologous exons across many taxa  leveraging DNA hybridization capture  In contrast to similar cross species enrichment studies that use biotinylated RNA probes transcribed from a commercially synthesized oligonucleotide panel targeting conserved sequences  we explore a method to agnostically capture exonic sequence using amplified  biotinylated cDNA libraries  Using such probe sets derived from two common species for which RNA is readily available  we enrich genomic DNA libraries from across the greater diversity of Prorhynchida and sequence in multiplex  We evaluate the success of these experiments using sets of orthologs mined from de novo transcriptome assemblies in select taxa  comparing the proportion of on target reads for cross species enrichments at varying genetic distance from the probe seed species  and also considering the effects of diverse enrichment conditions  e g  varying probe library ratios  and the impact of touchdown style hybridization programs   We also investigate the influence of gene expression level on the efficacy of enrichment using such cDNA probes  We conclude with a meditation on the general utility of this approach   which obviates the substantial up front bioinformatic and financial investment required for enrichment using commercially synthesized probes   for species level phylogenetics in non model systems  
MAC PRF  Inferring intragenic clusters of sites under natural selection from polymorphism and divergence  Inference of natural selection between recently diverged species often relies on comparison and contrast of polymorphism and divergence in DNA sequences  Typically  whole genes have been assessed  analyzed as a unit  and implicated as being under selection  because uniform intensity of selection is an implicit or explicit assumption of extant tests for selection based on polymorphism and divergence  However  site specific analyses of molecular divergence as well as abundant indirect evidence imply that regions within genes experience diverse levels of natural selection  To quantify this variation in selection based on intragenic polymorphism and divergence  we present a novel approach combining Model Averaged Clustering with Poisson Random Field theory  MAC PRF   We demonstrate that when selection varies across a linear sequence  our method provides greater accuracy and precision than intragenically homogeneous Poisson Random Field approaches in estimating selection intensities  Furthermore  our genomic analysis of genes across the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome demonstrates that although much of the coding sequence is under purifying rather than adaptive natural selection  nearly 50  of coding sequence overall is under an adaptive regime of selection  and adaptively evolving sites are distributed across about 80  of the genes in the whole genome  The presence of extensive regions of purifying selection explains the finding that few genes are significant under traditional tests of polymorphism and divergence  even though many critical sites or regions within individual genes are playing important adaptive roles in an evolutionary history of adaptive natural selection  
Convergent evolution of the conspicuously colored tail in lizards  implications for the evolution of color signals  Conspicuous coloration in animals has often evolved as a signal to deter predators or for social communication  Understanding how conspicuous color signals are gained and lost in a phylogenetic context can provide insight into the conditions that favor their evolution  One such color signal among lizards is a highly contrasting  conspicuously colored tail that is present in at least seven lizard families on four continents   We used non phylogenetic and phylogenetic comparative analyses of 686 lizards  skinks and their allies in the infraorder Scincomorpha  to estimate the frequency of gains and losses of the conspicuously colored tail and the number of evolutionary transitions between tail colors   We found that 8 2  of these lizards have a brightly colored tail with 68  blue tailed  25  red tailed  and 7  with a bright yellow tail  The conspicuous tail is lost as adults in 30  of these lizards   We also found that there are multiple gains and losses of the brightly colored tail  and several evolutionary transitions between each tail color  Our research demonstrates the evolutionary dynamics of a color signal in lizards and may have implications for understanding selective pressures that lead to the evolutionary gain and loss of conspicuous coloration  
Determining orthology using identity thresholds reduces the comparability of genomic datasets across species              Comparing patterns of genetic diversity across species permits insight into the shared processes responsible for diversity across organisms  As massively parallel sequencing approaches are used to examine more species  there is an understandable interest in using genomic datasets to compare diversity across species  Comparisons are hampered  however  by differences in datasets resulting from the way genomic datasets are generally processed  Unlike in the days of conserved primers and standardized markers  assessing the orthology of massively parallel sequencing reads is not straightforward  Sequence identity thresholds are typically established in an attempt to assemble orthologous data while separating or removing paralogous data  Due to differences across the genome in the amount of variation  however  thresholds are expected to imperfectly distinshuish between paralogous and orthologous data  As a result  a substantial number of more divergent orthologous regions may be removed inadvertently from many datasets              We examined the influence of the loss of orthologous regions due the use of identity thresholds on estimates of genetic diversity  We used simulations to examine the effect of thresholds on simulated datasets with shallower versus older divergences as well as small versus large population sizes  We used the filtered datasets to estimate commonly used indices of diversity including theta and divergence time  We found that applying the same thresholds separately on each dataset resulted in differences in the number of orthologous loci removed  and also in a commensurate downward bias in estimates of divergence time and theta  Consistent with the simulation results  we observed a decrease in diversity parameter estimates with lower identity thresholds in RAD Seq data from populations of a Neotropical bird                Our results suggest that massively parallel sequencing datasets obtained separately for different species  populations  or genomic regions may not be readily comparable  We suggest that the limited comparability of massively parallel sequencing datasets could be alleviated with more informed threshold selection or the use of loci with conserved regions for which orthology assessment is more straightforward  Even then  conclusions about relative diversity across species should be taken with a grain of salt  
Phylogenomic comparisons in the Mimulus cardinalis species complex  Phylogenomic analyses provide an important complement to experimental studies of adaptation and speciation  For example  loci linked to targets of selection  and those having undergone gene flow can show can show drastically different evolutionary histories from the rest of the genome  Variation across the M  cardinalis species complex  monkeyflowers  provides opportunities to test how shifts in pollination syndrome and chromosomal evolution impact phylogenetic relationships across the genome   The complex encompasses sister taxa  bee pollinated M  lewisii and hummingbird pollinated M  cardinalis  selfer M  parishii  and an independently derived clade of hummingbird pollinated taxa  We use genomic resequence data to evaluate these putative phylogenetic relationships at a genome wide scale  test for discordance between consensus and single gene trees  then assess whether incomplete lineage sorting or gene flow are likely responsible  These analyses allow us to ask whether regions linked to adaptive quantitative trait loci  QTLs  and known chromosomal rearrangements are over represented among discordant trees  Chromosomal rearrangements both cause hybrid sterility and contain major QTLs underlying pollinator divergence in M  lewisii and M  cardinalis  Additionally  a lack of transgressive segregation for floral pigment traits in hybrids between M  cardinalis and other hummingbird pollinated taxa suggests the possibility that shared genetic variation contributed to parallel shifts in pollination syndrome  Combined with additional experimental data  these analyses will allow us to test whether genomic regions underlying hummingbird pollination have truly independent origins  or whether adaptive introgression  possibly pre packaged in chromosomal rearrangements  contributed to phenotypic convergence across clades  
Effects of Ecological Interactions on Diversfication and Trait Evolution  Tests with Macroevolutionary Models  Ecological theories yield sometimes contradictory predictions about the effects of interspecific interactions on macroevolutionary patterns  For example  adaptive radiation predicts that diversification and morphological evolution will both decrease in the presence of competitors  while ecological character displacement generally predicts that morphological evolution will increase with competition   I tested for relationships between coexistence  ecological similarity  diversification  and ecomorphological evolution  in woodpeckers and related birds  Aves  Picidae   These birds have demonstrated relationships between skeletal morphology and ecological characteristics  I used a well resolved phylogeny  skeletal measurements  and distribution data to test for a number of predicted relationships  the complete data set included approximately half of all described species  I found no correlation between coexistence with similar species and rates of morphological evolution  Surprisingly  diversification rate was positively correlated with overlap with similar species  a relationship not predicted by any of the models  This pattern may be driven by variation among clades in habitat partitioning  such that more diverse clades partition space more finely than the spatial resolution of this study  or by some as yet undetermined process  
Detecting relationships between integrated thermal environments   current gene expression profiles in corals  Organisms are constantly responding to changes in environment  Many have evolved acute stress responses to deal with environmental extremes  for example the heat shock response in coral prior to bleaching  Yet over longer periods of time  organisms have also evolved mechanisms to integrate sub lethal changes in environment  leading to an eventual physiological response  Notable examples include chilling hours required for bud breaking in plants as well as light   temperature durations to trigger leaf senescence  In this study  we focus on sub lethal thermal integration in coral  Evidence for coral thermal integration is most notably summarized in the Degree Heating Week cumulative heat stress metric utilized by the NOAA Coral Reef Watch program to predict bleaching susceptibility on a global scale  Yet the index is based only on deviations in sea surface temperatures and the biological underpinning of thermal integration has not yet been extensively explored  In other organisms  microarrays and RNAseq have been used to elucidate patterns of gene expression associated with integrated thermal stress   i e  increase in expression of metabolic pathways after a duration and degree of chilling hours before bud breaking in plants   This study focuses on utilizing nearly continuous temperature data experienced by individual coral colonies from American Samoa up to six months prior to transcriptome collection to assess gene expression clusters that best describe integrated thermal profiles  similar to that in bud breaking plants  We do so by assessing the temperature threshold and integration of exposure that seems to best describe contemporary expression of pathways  Doing so may refine our understanding of coral thermal integration in the face of climate change  
Elevational disease distribution in a natural plant pathogen system  Insights from genetic variation in resistance and morphology   Factors governing species distributions have become a central topic of discussion on the potential impacts of global climate change  The distribution of parasitic organisms is particularly important  as emerging and re emerging infectious diseases are predicted to increasingly threaten public health  agriculture  and biodiversity  Experimental evidence for the ecological and evolutionary factors that may determine disease distributions in natural systems is sparse  In particular  the intimate association of species specific parasites with their hosts  often having long and entwined evolutionary histories  is sometimes characterized by a co evolutionary arms race which may also play an important role in shaping where disease is found  Here  we investigated evolutionary factors that may contribute to the restricted distribution of anther smut disease caused by Microbotryum spp  in high elevation populations of its widespread host species  Silene vulgaris  in the alpine region of eastern France  Controlled laboratory inoculations were conducted in host populations from along four replicate transects to test the hypothesis that the pathogen is excluded from lower elevations by physiological resistance in the host  We found that high elevation hosts were actually more likely to have higher rates of avoidance resistance  i e   lower rates of successful infection  classically used to test for   resistance   in this system   rates of recovery resistance  i e   delay or clearance disease following infection  were higher in diseased plants originating from lower elevations  Consistent with previous studies  we also found little variation in infectivity of fungal strains across elevation  These results indicate that spatial structure in host recovery resistance may contribute to the restricted distribution of anther smut disease in S  vulgaris  whereas the contrary pattern of avoidance resistance may instead result from   rather than cause   the selective pressure of the sterilizing fungus current elevational range   
Latitudinal clines in genome wide variation predict host race differences in Rhagoletis pomonella  Rhagoletis pomonella  Diptera  Tephritidae   the apple maggot fly  is a classic example of speciation with gene flow  Following the introduction of the apple tree  Malus domestica   a host shift from the native hawthorn  Crataegus spp   occurred  resulting in the formation of R  pomonella apple and haw host races  Previous research has shown that  despite low levels of gene flow  these races differ significantly in allele frequencies  host odor preference  and eclosion diapause timing  mirroring the fruiting phenology of their respective host plants  In addition to differences between host species  fruiting phenology also varies substantially across latitude  within host species  Thus  we predict that genetic variation  specifically that associated with eclosion timing in the R  pomonella host races  should vary across latitude  as well  Here we use SNPs generated from RAD seq data to examine geographic patterns of genetic variation within and between host races  We show that allele frequencies for both apple and haw races of R  pomonella are highly correlated with latitude  In addition  the north south cline in allele frequencies within the haw race strongly predicts allele frequency differences between apple and haw races  suggesting that the host shift from haw to apple produced a shift toward  southern  allele frequencies  Within race clines are also correlated with results of a previous experiment  indicating that selection for surviving a longer pre winter period during diapause  i e   apple like  conditions  may result in more  southern  allele frequencies  These results could have important implications for understanding genetic variation underlying key traits in the differentiation of R  pomonella apple and haw host races   
How Nonadditivity of Fitness Impacts Alters Selection for Resistance in a Multiple Herbivore Community  Organisms in nature are simultaneously or sequentially subjected to multiple stresses with which they must cope to survive and reproduce  Can ecological and evolutionary responses to the stresses be sufficiently understood from looking at one stressor at a time  This question has been of particular interest in the field of plant herbivore coevolution  Specifically  if the fitness impacts of two herbivores combine nonadditively  i e   the total impact is not equal to the sum of the individual impacts   then any coevolution between the host plant and herbivores would be considered  diffuse   This supposition that nonadditivity of impact necessarily leads to diffuse coevolution has recently been questioned  however  which has resulted in a diminishing focus on how impacts of herbivores combine even though it is recognized that most plants are attacked by a diverse community of multiple herbivores  Here  I show with simple models how nonadditivity of herbivore impacts necessarily leads to diffuse selection on host plant resistance  The models make three main predictions  1  If two herbivores affect the same plant resource  e g   they are both leaf chewers   then their effect will be additive if that resource was the one limiting plant fitness  2  If two herbivores affect the same plant resource  but it takes damage by both herbivores to cause this resource to become limiting  then the impacts will combine synergistically  i e   greater than additively   3  If two herbivores affect different resources  e g   one is a flower feeder and the other is a leaf feeder   then the impacts will combine antagonistically  i e   less than additively   I tested the third prediction in a field experiment using the herbivore community of the native herbaceous weed horsenettle  Solanum carolinense   Four levels of leaf damage  controlled with insecticide  were factorially crossed with five levels of simulated weevil damage to flower buds  and seed production was recorded  The fitness impact of the two types of damage combined significantly antagonistically  Specifically  the fitness impact of floral damage was greatest when foliar damage was minimal  and the fitness impact of leaf damage was greatest when floral damage was minimal  The results also suggest that selection for resistance against flower feeding would be negligible when leaf feeders are common  and vice versa  Such antagonistic impacts may explain why multiple herbivores may exist on a host plant  even though selection would favor increased resistance if any of the herbivore species fed alone on the plant  
HOST BIRDS COMBAT CUCKOO MIMICRY BY EVOLVING RECOGNIZABLE EGG PATTERN SIGNATURES  HOST BIRDS COMBAT CUCKOO MIMICRY BY EVOLVING RECOGNIZABLE EGG PATTERN SIGNATURES  Mary Caswell Stoddard   Rebecca M  Kilner  Christopher Town  The Common Cuckoo  Cuculus canorus  is a brood parasite that deposits its eggs in the nests of unrelated host species  As part of this coevolutionary arms race  many host species have evolved egg rejection defenses in response to cuckoo parasitism  In turn  many host specific races of the Common Cuckoo have evolved egg mimicry  Once egg mimicry has evolved  how can hosts improve their chances of distinguishing and rejecting foreign cuckoo eggs  In theory  hosts subjected to cuckoo egg mimicry should evolve egg patterns which are highly recognizable  yet evidence for this has been mixed  in part because we lack appropriate tools for quantifying egg pattern information  We developed a pattern recognition tool which  in a way that is analogous to vertebrate vision  extracts important features from a visual scene  We applied this algorithm to images of eggs laid by hosts of the Common Cuckoo to determine whether hosts subjected to intense cuckoo mimicry have evolved the most recognizable egg patterns  Our results support the hypothesis that many hosts have evolved recognizable egg patterns as a defense against cuckoo mimicry  lending new support to the idea that host egg patterns play a major role in the arms race interactions between cuckoos and hosts  However  our analysis revealed several surprises  for example  not all recognizable patterns share the same features  In this presentation  we provide an in depth analysis of the key features that appear critical for the evolution of recognizable egg patterns  We also relate these findings to broad questions about the evolution of recognition among rivals  neighbors and kin in other animal taxa  
Genome wide RAD data yields fine resolution species relationships in embiotocid surfperches  Advances in next generation sequencing technology  NGS  along with decreased costs have led to a rapid expansion in the field of population genomics  A particularly attractive approach that requires no prior genomic information and that simultaneously genotypes while sequencing is restriction site associated DNA  RAD  markers  Although this technique has been used alongside population genomics to do things such as identify candidate loci under selection and parallel adaptation  there have been relatively few RAD phylogenomic studies  In order for RAD data to provide phylogenetically informative data  a sufficient number of orthologous restriction sites must be retained across taxa  Recent simulations suggest that sufficient orthologous RAD markers exist within relatively young taxonomic groups to correctly infer  known  phylogenies for drosophila  ²40 60 mya  and primates   22 mya   Additionally  recent work has resolved species relationships and boundaries in Lake Victoria cichlids using RAD data  Here  we use phylogenetically informative RAD data to infer relationships among all genera and 22 species of surfperches  Embiotocidae   resulting in the most complete and well supported surfperch phylogeny to date  There are currently 24 valid species divided into 13 genera  seven of which contain only one species  20 species are found in the eastern Pacific along the western coast of North America from southern Alaska to central Baja  Mexico  with one freshwater species found in the central valley of California   The other four species reside in the western Pacific along the coasts of Japan and Korea  The highest density of surfperch species can be found between latitudes 32¡N and 38¡N off the coast of California  It is likely that ancestral surfperches radiated north and south out from California coastal waters and colonized the western Pacific during an interglacial warming period  To better understand this radiation  we generated robust  well supported phylogenies by drawing from over 150 000 phylogenetically informative SNPs from across the genome in our largest RAD data sets  This allowed for high resolution species relationships and clarified previously unresolved and low support branches from earlier embiotocid molecular phylogenies   This phylogeny sheds new light on the processes of adaptive radiation in this family  
Post invasive evolution of Hawaiis feral chickens    Feral animals provide unique opportunities to learn how lineages with diverse selection histories adapt to the complex selection regimes found in nature  Here  we combine molecular  behavioral and morphological analyses to identify the origin s  of Kauais feral chickens  Gallus gallus   and to characterize their evolution    The potential sources of Kauai s feral chickens include several farmed breeds  which are products of divergent artificial selection for male male competition  cockfighting roosters   rapid reproduction  egg layers   and efficient metabolism  meat producers   Polynesians also introduced red junglefowl to Kauai ca  1000 years ago  which are conspecific  and can interbreed  with chickens  It is not known if these animals persisted    We conducted phylogenetic studies of Kauai s chickens  and recovered two divergent mitochondrial clades  The low frequency mitotype was identical to one recovered from ancient bones that predate European contact  The high frequency clade clusters with contemporary samples from throughout the Pacific  thought to descend from European breeds that only recently became feral    We also analyzed behavioral  vocalization  and morphological data  which we sampled in the field and mined from social media  Youtube   Kauai chickens  behavior and morphology were intermediate between those of red junglefowl and domesticated individuals  perhaps indicating genetic introgression    Together  our results indicate Kauai s chickens are genetically and phenotypically diverse  and may result from admixture between lineages with divergent selection histories  We are now examining the evolutionary role of sexual selection within the feral environment  
A molecular phylogeny of black fungus gnats  Diptera  Sciaridae  and the evolution of larval habitats  The phylogeny of Sciaridae is reconstructed based on maximum likelihood  maximum parsimony  and bayesian analyses  Molecular results are largely congruent with one of the former hypotheses based on morphological data with respect to the monophyly of genera and subfamilies  Sciarinae  and Megalosphyinae   however  the subfamily Cratyninae is shown to be polyphyletic  and the genera Bradysia  Corynoptera  Leptosciarella  Lycoriella  and Phytosciara are also recognized as non monophyletic groups  While the ancestral larval habitat state of the family Sciaridae  based on bayesian inference  is dead plant material  the common ancestors of Phytosciara and Bradysia are inferred to living plants habitat  Therefore  shifts in larval habitats from dead plant material to living plants may have occurred within the Sciaridae at least once   
Environmental effects on genetic covariances  No trait exists in isolation  organisms are composed of integrated suites of correlated traits that evolve together  Because selection on one trait results in an indirect response to selection in correlated traits  trait correlations act as evolutionary constraints  interfering with evolutionary response in the direction favored by selection  However  the degree to which patterns of trait correlation and thus their role in evolutionary constraint are sensitive to the environment remains poorly understood   The relationships among correlated traits are described by the genetic variance covariance  G  matrix  This matrix contains the genetic variance of each trait along the diagonal and the strength and sign of trait covariances in the off diagonal elements   The genetic variances affect the magnitude of the response to selection  and the genetic covariances  the degree to which traits respond independently to conflicting selection pressures  Many environmental variables most notably stress  quality  and novelty have been shown to affect genetic variances  suggesting that a trait s capacity to respond to selection depends on the environment in which it is expressed   By contrast  environmental effects on genetic covariances remain understudied  in spite of the fact that the same mechanisms that drive differences in genetic variances  differences in the underlying loci or in the allelic effects among environments  should affect genetic covariances as well   Although a number of studies have estimated the G matrix in multiple environments  few have examined whether there are any general patterns that emerge across taxa   Strong environmental effects on patterns of genetic covariance would suggest that the role of constraint may be highly dependent on the local environment  We conducted a meta analysis on studies that have estimated the G matrix in multiple environments   We examine whether the environment affects the magnitude of genetic covariances and the direction of the major axes of genetic variation  We discuss the implications of our results in the context of environmental effects on evolutionary constraint in natural populations  
Intraguild Predation Leads to Genome Wide Adaptation in the Threespine Stickleback  Natural selection has long been appreciated as a crucial component in the generation of phenotypic diversity   However  studies of the genetics of adaptation have been largely restricted to laboratory experiments or measurements of candidate genes in the wild and it is unknown if results from these studies are representative of the process of adaptation in natural populations   The recent development of next generation sequencing provides us with the opportunity to study the genomic architecture of adaptation   Using the unique natural history of the threespine stickleback  Gasterosteus aculeatus   we isolated the effect of a single selective force  intraguild predation  IGP  by the prickly sculpin  Cottus asper    Marine stickleback became isolated in the coastal freshwater lakes of British Columbia following the last ice age   We identified a group of lakes  which differed only by the presence or absence of sculpin   IGP occurs when a predator kills and eats a species that is a potential competitor for shared resources   As a consequence  sculpin can have a dual impact on the stickleback either via direct predation or indirectly by removing resources and increasing competition   Stickleback populations sympatric with prickly sculpin show evidence of parallel phenotypic adaptations   The presence of sculpin is correlated with an increase in stickleback anti predator defenses  a shift in diet  and a change in body shape   To examine the genetic basis of stickleback adaptation to IGP  we report the results of a genome wide analysis   Using whole genome re sequencing of 17 freshwater populations and 3 marine populations we generated over 5 million SNPs   Genome scans reveal that IGP has resulted in widespread but unevenly distributed selection across the genome   Regions of high divergence occur on multiple chromosomes and can span many genes   Many of the genomic regions that diverge between freshwater populations with and without IGP overlap with regions that have been implicated in marine and freshwater stickleback divergence   As a consequence  stickleback populations sympatric with sculpin are more genetically similar to the marine stickleback than stickleback from populations without sculpin   Selection from prickly sculpin has resulted in parallel phenotypic and genotypic adaptation in the threespine stickleback   
Recurrent recent dispersal accounts for treefrog diversification in hotspots of biodiversity in South America  Although the Neotropical region encompasses a large fraction of global biodiversity  knowledge about the origin and diversification of its biota is still limited  particularly in dry forest and savanna regions  The Cerrado savanna in Central Brazil  one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity  is remarkable for the high endemicity level of frogs and plants  among other organisms  Yet  the evolutionary processes responsible for this great diversity are largely unknown  We studied the diversification pattern and biogeographic history of a lineage of 33 treefrog species in the Hypsiboas pulchellus group with several endemics of the Cerrado savanna and other South American hotspots such as the Andes and the Atlantic Forest  This treefrog lineage originated in the Miocene  most likely in the area comprising the Andes and the Cerrado savanna  Surprisingly  we found no support for the hypothesized origin of this group in forested regions  Diversification was not constant  but rather followed a logistic density dependent model with a burst of speciation coinciding with the origin of C4 grasslands and expansion of savannas worldwide  All but one biogeographic units comprised multiple clades  highlighting the importance of dispersal in the radiation of this group rather than long term in situ diversification in those areas  Our range reconstruction indicates an interesting pattern of recurrent dispersal events in a stepping stone mode among distinct ecoregions in South America  including open and forested regions   This highlights the dynamic historical interchange between the Cerrado savanna and the surrounding ecoregions in South America  
Multimodal signaling in the North American barn swallow  influences of intra  and intersexual selection on signal evolution  Complex signals  involving multiple components within and across modalities  e g  visual or acoustic   are ubiquitous in animal communication  Numerous studies show benefits of complex signals in reducing search costs and maximizing signal efficacy  However  the interactions between multiple components of complex signals across modalities have not often been considered  Additionally  studies of complex signaling have typically focused on the role of female preferences in driving complexity  ignoring the contribution of intrasexual competition  Here  we utilize the North American barn swallow  Hirundo rustica erythrogaster  to demonstrate a novel approach for understanding the evolution of complex communication systems  in the context of male and female receivers  We integrate model testing with correlation based phenotype networks to infer the contributions of intra  and intersexual selection on the evolution of the barn swallow communication system  We find that different signaling traits likely evolved via female choice versus male male competition  with little signal overlap across contexts  We suggest that applying our approach broadly across taxa and sender receiver contexts will afford researchers new insight into the selective pressures and constraints affecting the evolution of communication  
A reappraisal of the productivity hypothesis for North American bird assemblages    Plant biomass productivity and the species richness of birds are associated across a range of spatial scales   Species energy theory is generally assumed to explain these correlations   If true  bird richness should also track productivity temporally  and there should be spatial and temporal relationships between bird abundance and both productivity and bird richness   Using summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  NDVI  from 1982   2006 and the North American Breeding Bird Survey  we evaluated the response of avian richness and abundance to temporal changes in plant biomass production   We found positive spatial relationships all 25 years   However  richness and NDVI were temporally positively associated at 1 579 survey sites and negatively associated at 1 627 sites  mean r2   0 09    Further  total abundance and NDVI were unrelated spatially  r2s spanning 
The rate of adaptation in a changing environment  Global warming is a major threat to biodiversity that goes beyond precedent  Historically  many species survived by shifting their range  but now human induced habitat loss and fragmentation commonly restricts range shifts  forcing species to adapt in situ or face extinction  Simulations  using a model integrating population dynamics  mutation  environmental variance  and genetic change  examine the relationship between maximum phenotypic and genetic rates of change  Not surprisingly  small populations of range bound species  103 or less  will be severely limited in their long term response to very rapid climate change  however  linked populations can adapt effectively if gene flow between neighboring reserves is adequate
