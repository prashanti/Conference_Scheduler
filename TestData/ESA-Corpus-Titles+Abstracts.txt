Interspecific variation in savanna tree rooting profiles and response to competition from grasses  Evidence from modeling and empirical studies	  The Walter model of tree grass coexistence posits that trees and grasses are able to coexist in stable equilibrium as a result of rooting differences  Grasses are assumed to be competitively dominant in shallow soil layers while trees have access to deep moisture  A key premise of this two layer model is that exclusive access to deep water is required by one of the two functional groups  A theoretical model that couples soil moisture and tree uptake and biomass dynamics suggests that exclusive access is not necessary for coexistence  as long as realistic  stochastic  rainfall dynamics are assumed  Subtle differences in rooting profiles allow coexistence of two or more species or functional groups with identical maximum rooting depths  This initial work is expanded here to identify the extent of limiting similarity  defined by two key traits  root shape and water use efficiency  that precludes coexistence under alternative water supply regimes  The theoretical results are then used as a backdrop for a greenhouse experiment designed to quantify the strength of tree grass competition across three distinct tree rooting strategies  The model results showed strong effects of root shape  water use efficiency and the timing of rainfall events on coexistence and the strength of competition  and identified threshold root shape differences that permit coexistence after controlling for differences in plant physiological traits  The results of the greenhouse experiment suggested that the strength of tree grass competition varies markedly among tree species  but the inter specific differences were counterintuitive  The species with the shallowest rooting system   Dichrostachys cinerea         the most   grass like    performed better against grasses than the deeper rooted Schlerocarya birrea   A possible explanation for this result is that soil moisture is depleted from shallow layers before deep infiltration can occur        exploitative competition occurs between the shallow rooted grass and the deep rooted tree despite the fact that little rooting overlap occurs   This is consistent with the results of the theoretical model  which suggest that the strength of competition between alternative rooting strategies is strongly modulated by the timing and size of rainfall events       
Evaluating the patterns of below ground woody biomass along the Kalahari rainfall gradient The contribution of savannas to global carbon storage is poorly understood  in part due to lack of knowledge of the amount of belowground biomass  In these ecosystems  the coexistence of woody and herbaceous life forms is often explained on the basis of belowground interactions among roots  However  the distribution of root biomass in savannas has seldom been investigated  and the dependence of root biomass on rainfall remains unclear  particularly for woody plants  Here we investigate patterns of belowground woody biomass along a rainfall gradient  from 600 mm/yr in the north to 180 mm/yr in the south  in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana  on homogeneous sandy soils  We test the hypotheses that  1  the root depth increases with mean annual precipitation  root optimality and plant hydrotropism hypothesis   and  2  the root to shoot ratio increases with decreasing mean annual rainfall  functional equilibrium hypothesis   Both hypotheses have been previously assessed for herbaceous vegetation using global root data sets Our data do not support these hypotheses for the case of woody plants in the Kalahari  We find that in the Kalahari  the root profiles of woody plants do not become deeper with increasing mean annual precipitation  whereas the root to shoot ratios decrease along a gradient of increasing aridity       
Plasticity in kinetics of organic and inorganic root uptake in conifer seedlings experiencing high nitrate input	  Atmospheric nitrogen  N  deposition has serious consequences in many ecosystems of the world but the problem is particularly acute in coniferous forests  Plant supply of N in these systems often includes ammonium and nitrate but a large portion of N demand may be met by organic sources  There are reasons to believe that chronic N addition may downregulate root system transporters of these N sources primarily through changes in plant N demand  However  the direct impact cannot be ruled out  Here  we examined effects of chronic nitrate addition on uptake kinetics of ammonium  two amino acids  glycine and glutamine  and one amino sugar  glucosamine   We used one year old seedlings of four conifers species  Abies fraseri  AF   Picea abies  PA   Picea pungens  PP   and Pseudotsuga menziesii  PM    During the two months of N manipulation  seedlings received all essential nutrients according to a  frac12  strength Hoagland recipe but nitrate was added at either 0 1 or 5 mM concentration daily  In all species  high nitrate exposure inhibited kinetics of ammonium uptake  Kinetics of amino acids and the amino sugar responded to nitrate addition in a species specific manner  High nitrate exposure resulted in a significant reduction in root uptake capacity of all organic N forms  in AF and PP   a significant decrease in AP and no significant changes in PM   We conclude that increased atmospheric N input results in significant changes in root N uptake kinetics but this plasticity is highly dependent on species identity and N form  The differential species responses shown here is a possible mechanism potentially explaining why in many ecosystems chronic N addition alters plant community composition       
Changes in root traits explain patterns of biomass allocation in response to N  CO 2   and diversity  Roots are responsible for supplying where water and nutrients to aboveground tissues  and represent a large component of carbon inputs and storage in ecosystems  The amount of biomass plants allocate to this belowground interface responds to a range of conditions  The   functional equilibrium   hypothesis predicts that plant biomass is allocated to capture the most limiting resources  Many studies have investigated biomass partitioning in relation abiotic and biotic factors  but these have mainly been short term studies carried out on single plants or monocultures  We used a long term experiment manipulating N  CO 2   and diversity for 15 years in a mesic grassland to test the Functional Equilibrium hypothesis  We measured aboveground and belowground standing biomass and a suite of root traits to investigate the mechanisms of biomass partitioning in response to important climate change variables N addition  diversity  and their interaction all had significant effects on the amount of biomass allocated to the Root Mass Fraction  RMF   At low diversity  plots exposed to elevated CO 2 had higher RMF than the other treatments  but at high diversity  the plots receiving additional N had the highest RMF compared to all other treatment and diversity levels  N addition generally reduces the RMF in plants  and so the response of high diversity plots to N addition seems counterintuitive  Here  we discuss changes in root morphology and physiology that help explain this apparent paradox       
Roots at work  Root responses to heterogeneity of soil biota The positive correlation between biodiversity and productivity of grasslands has so far been attributed to resource complementarity of plant species  Here  we examine whether this phenomenon of overyielding can be explained by a more recently proposed hypothesis  higher productivity of more diverse plant communities is determined  in part  by the composition of soil biota communities  An experiment using soils trained with soil biota of four different plants and a proportional mixture of these soils showed that in monocultured soils  plant productivity was reduced compared to mixture soils  but restored by soil sterilization  Particular apparent was the growth of the grass species Anthoxanthum odoratum that was substantially promoted on Leucanthemum vulgare soil  showing species specificity of soil biota  Plants create soil legacies  a patchy soil  not only with nutrients  but also with species specific soil biota  While the influence of patchy nutrients on root growth behaviour is well studied we do not know whether roots can also choose between patches of different soil biota  To investigate this  we performed two short term experiments in a climate chamber with non sterilized and sterilized treatments and homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions of soil biota   As in the previous experiment  plants produced more biomass when growing in sterilized compared to non sterilized soils  Productivity was higher when plants were confronted with heterogeneous distributions of soil biota than with homogeneous distributions  while no differences in biomass occurred between these distributions if soil biota were absent  Selective placement of roots in nutrient hotspots can lead to higher productivity in soils with heterogeneous nutrient distributions  In our experiment with heterogeneous soil biota  however  no differences in rooting placement occurred  as the amount of roots was similar in all compartments  Root activity of the roots measured by rates of 15N uptake  however  did differ with  in general  higher uptake rates in compartments containing soil biota of other species  Our results suggest that root physiological responses to distributions of species specific soil biota are more important than morphological responses  Root activity changes locally as a result of the interaction of these roots with the species specific soil biota present in that patch  resulting in higher plant productivity when soil biota are heterogeneously distributed       
Root morphology and root foraging in temperate trees Co occurring arbuscular mycorrhizal  AM  trees in central Pennsylvania forests vary widely in root morphology  Species like Magnolia acuminata and Liriodendron tulipifera have considerably coarser 1 st  order roots  stream based ordering system  than those of species like Ulmus americana and Acer rubrum  We examined how variation in root diameter  branching intensity and specific root length of 1 st   and 2 nd  order roots was linked with root proliferation  root longevity and mycorrhizal colonization in nutrient rich patches  We hypothesized that trees with finer absorptive roots would more readily proliferate in nutrient rich patches and would more readily extend the lifespan of those roots but would be more slowly colonized by AM fungi than trees with coarser absorptive roots  For the proliferation/mycorrhizal study  we examined roots of trees that were canopy dominants or co dominants in an approximately 70 yr old forest  For the lifespan study  we used a 15 yr old common garden  In the forest  roots of different species were isolated by tracing the woody root back to the trunk  Roots were pruned and allowed to regrow in mesh bags either unfertilized or amended with slow release fertilizer at a rate intended to increase nitrate and ammonium levels about four fold over unamended levels  In the common garden  the fates of roots were tracked with minirhizotrons in single species plots Species of small root diameter that constructed their roots for high length per unit dry weight  SRL  had higher branching intensity  number of 1 st  order roots/cm of 2 nd order root  R 2 = 0 75   higher root proliferation rate in unfertilized soil   R 2 = 0 74  and lower mycorrhizal colonization   R 2 = 0 63   Fertilization tended to increased root proliferation rate more in species with small diameter roots  Mycorrhizal colonization was generally unaffected by fertilization in species with coarse roots but strongly diminished in species with coarse roots  Lifespan was extended in fine root species but unaffected in coarse root species  This study underscores the different ways co occurring trees of differing root morphology may forage for limited nutrients  Fine root species are clearly more plastic in nutrient foraging  as indicated by greater proliferation  greater shifts in lifespan  and greater reductions in mycorrhizal colonization  We hypothesize that coarse root species may exploit resource rich patches not by root proliferation  but perhaps by mycorrhizal hyphal exploitation       
Root structure and water use diversity of Kalahari savanna woody plant communities	    The root zone of savannas is often conceptualized as two homogeneous layers with shallow rooted grasses and deep rooted trees  but recent findings on water use characteristics and drought response suggest that the root structure of coexisting woody plants may be more diverse  Using compressed air  we excavated individual trees and shrubs and mapped their coarse root systems on a three dimensional grid system up to 1 5 m depth  We excavated four woody savanna species at three sites spanning a climate gradient on the Kalahari Transect in southern Africa   Overall  species was more important than site in determining rooting depth  distribution with depth  and lateral relative to vertical extent  as well as small scale characteristics of root system structure such as root taper rate and sinuosity  The species excavated fell into two groups that coexisted across the climate gradient  Acacia mellifera and Terminalia sericea had straight roots in a laterally extensive system that was shallow relative to the aggregate root profile for woody plants at the sites  Boscia albitrunca and Ochna pulchra had sinuous roots that were mostly concentrated beneath the canopy and were more prevalent in deep than near surface soil layers  departing from the conventional model of decreasing root abundance with depth  The shallow rooted species had small taproots  though it is unlikely that they reached the water table  Deep  and shallow rootedness appear to correlate with other characteristics such as growth form  tree or shrub  and drought deciduousness       
Variation of first order root traits across climatic gradients and evolutionary trends in geological time Global inter specific variation observed in plant leaf traits has been shown to represent the leaf evolution and adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions  Similar patterns in functional trait variation and evolution has been assumed to exist in plant roots  However  our understandings of large scale patterns and the underlying mechanisms of root trait variation and evolution are very limited  especially when compared with leaf traits  Here we collected the first order roots  stream based ordering system  of 65 tree species in six forests sites from subtropical to temperate zones in China  Root diameter  specific root length  length to dry mass ratio  and branching ratio  number of first order roots per second order root  were measured  We examined the degree of variation in key functional traits in morphology and architecture for the first order roots across large geographical scales  In addition  we conducted regression analysis at the family level to assess root trait variation in an evolutionary context  We found strong climatic and phylogenetic patterns in root traits  Root morphology in the wet  subtropical zone was much more variable among species  where trees with thick and thin roots coexisted  In contrast  the variation was narrower among species in temperate  more arid zone  where most tree species tended to grow thin roots  usually with a higher branching ratio  These thin roots are putatively better equipped to cope with the generally lower and temporally more variable soil moisture in the temperate zone  In an evolutionary context  we found average root diameter decreased and branching ratio increased markedly with family divergence time from mid to late Cretaceous  During this geological time the atmospheric CO 2 concentration progressively decreased  so plants might have increased their stomatal conductance at the expense of increased water loss  Producing root systems with smaller diameter and higher branching ratio may have helped plants cope with periodic water stress  Future study is required to resolve whether the patterns identified here are applicable to a wider range of species       
Long term root standing biomass development in a biodiversity experiment does not show evidence for vertical niche differentiation belowground It is well known that plant biodiversity positively affects ecosystem functioning at multiple trophic levels aboveground and belowground  Evidence is accumulating that the higher biomass production in plant mixtures compared to monocultures  overyielding   a general phenomenon aboveground  also occurs belowground  A major hypothesis underlying overyielding is belowground niche differentiation  with different plant species   or different plant functional groups   having different  more segregated rooting patterns in mixtures than in monocultures  However  very few studies exist that test this hypothesis in  semi  natural environments  We questioned  How does root standing biomass develop over time in a long term biodiversity experiment  Do we find evidence at the community level for vertical niche differentiation in rooting patterns  We analyzed root standing biomass in the 0 30 cm soil profile of a diversity gradient  1 16 species  4 functional groups  over nine years in the Jena Experiment  Germany   We compared above  and belowground effects of diversity on plant production along the diversity gradient  If spatial niche differentiation would occur  we expected increasing mean rooting depth and increasing evenness of root biomass over the soil profile with increasing diversity  Aboveground overyielding occurred immediately from the first growing season onwards  Belowground overyielding was three years delayed compared to aboveground  as we found a positive effect of biodiversity on root standing biomass first in the fourth growing season  This positive relationship became progressively stronger towards the ninth year of the experiment  Plant functional group presence had little additional effect on root standing biomass on top of species richness effects  This belowground overyielding does not appear to be the result of spatial niche differentiation  Mean rooting depth over the 0 30 cm soil profile was 9 8  plusmn  0 30 cm over all communities  and was not affected by species or functional group richness  Evenness in root biomass decreased rather than increased with increasing diversity  We conclude that evidence for belowground vertical niche differentiation is lacking in the 0 30 cm soil profile of the Jena Experiment even after nine years  although we cannot rule out differential root uptake activities of the species involved  Alternative explanations for overyielding  such as temporal or chemical niche differentiation  and plant soil feedback  should thus be considered       
Foraging the frozen feast  Uptake of nitrogen from thawing permafrost in subarctic peatlands Thawing of permafrost soils affects many northern peatlands  where one third of the world  s soil organic carbon is stored due to their high ratio of carbon assimilation to carbon mineralization  Because plant production in these peatlands is often nitrogen  N  limited  a release of permafrost N upon thawing may likely stimulate net primary production or change species composition  However  surprisingly little is known about plant availability and plant uptake of nitrogen stored in permafrost soils  We quantified plant available N in thawing permafrost soils of subarctic peatlands and found up to seven times more plant available N in near surface permafrost soil compared to the current rooting zone layer  With the work presented here  we aimed to identify the potential impact of this increased N availability due to thawing permafrost on subarctic peatland plant production and species composition  We compared this impact with the effect of increased nutrient availability in shallower layers  e g  in relation to enhanced N mineralization due to climatic warming   Therefore  we supplied 15 N labelled nitrogen at the thaw front and performed a 3 year full factorial belowground fertilization experiment with deep fertilization at the thaw front at 45 cm depth and shallow fertilization at 10 cm depth We found that only particular species  e g  Rubus chamaemorus   have active roots at the thaw front  Further  if presented with increased nitrogen at the thaw front  these species had higher aboveground biomass and N content  whereas this was not the case for shallower rooting species  e g  E  hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia    Moreover  the effects of increased nutrient availability at the thaw front on total aboveground biomass production were similar in magnitude to the effects of increased nutrient availability in shallower layers  Nutrient limitation of plant growth in subarctic peatlands appeared to be strong enough for the effects of increased deep and shallow nutrient availability on biomass production to be additive  Altogether  these results show that plant available N released from thawing permafrost can be considered a true   new   N source for deep rooting sub arctic plant species  which will increase their biomass production  As this is not the case for shallow rooting species  the release of plant available N from thawing permafrost has the potential to alter species composition on the long term by benefitting specific deep rooting species only       
Classification of plant functional types The term 'plant functional type'  PFT   now a generic name for almost all concepts of basic ecological plant types  was coined originally for groups of species with similar responses to environmental conditions  especially climatic change  Unlike more integrative concepts  PFTs involved seasonality but no reference to plant form  as if this were irrelevant  The 2 by 2 plus alpha   vegetation   units now used in most large area modeling are also often called PFTs but are actually only highly generalized cover classes  Earlier ideas of basic ecological plant types include 'growth forms'  form function units called 'life forms'   sensu vero    more variable 'living forms'  and the   ecophysiognomic forms   first used in large area modeling  All of these concepts recognized that plant function is intimately related to plant form  including its seasonal variations  The first attempt to use plant types in geographic modeling  Box 1981  required 90 types to cover the main features of world terrestrial vegetation  That list now includes about 130 basic types  which express the form characters needed for physiological models of different plant types  Classifications for geographic modeling have generally been top down exercises involving what has been called 'geographic regression'     postulating types  predicting their occurrence  and treating what remains uncovered  This presentation reviews classification approaches  especially the necessary form attributes of plant permanence  size  structure  and seasonality pattern  Structure involves not only physiognomic types such as trees but also morphological adaptations such as leaf   hardness    Seasonality must include some degree of plasticity  Also presented  for high latitude application  are  a hypothesized classification of relevant plant types  comparison of these types with species lists representing northern North America  Scandinavia and Russia  and an expanded classification based on the results  The fraction of species not classified adequately measures the validity of any classification  For better modeling  three things must be admitted  covering the important functional features of world terrestrial vegetation requires many more types than commonly used now  more plasticity is needed in defining their characteristics  and plant function involves integrated  interdependent manifestations that cannot be represented by independent 'traits'       
Sensitivity of PFT definitions to carbon cycle simulations in DGVMs Earth System Models  ESMs  represent vegetation by grouping them into 10 20 plant functional types  PFTs  based on a phenomenological species classification of characteristics including photosynthetic pathway  leaf phenology and their growth locations  An important question to ask  however  is whether these PFTs are adequate for the simulation of global carbon cycle under current and future climate conditions  To address this question  we design three different scenarios to assess the effects of PFT definitions on carbon cycle simulations by comparing the model predictions based on one general PFT and two PFTs with very different physiological components  Specifically  we are comparing the model performances to predict vegetation responses to drought  warming  and carbon allocation with different representations of drought tolerances  nitrogen use strategies and carbon allocations to roots among PFTs  respectively We expect that the single PFT representation is able to be adjusted to simulate the same magnitude of the carbon cycles as in the two PFT representation  however  it will fail to simulate the vegetation responses under a changing climate condition  In summary  we conclude that it may be adequate to simulate the vegetation dynamic under current climate conditions based on phenomenological classification through parameter adjustment  To correctly simulate the vegetation response under future climatic conditions  it is important to have more advanced definitions of PFTs that consider key physiological components that are relevant under future climatic change       
New concepts for trait based classification of plant functional types Current dynamic global vegetation models  DGVMs   including those incorporated into Earth System Models  ESMs   represent terrestrial vegetation by a small number of plant functional types  PFTs  with fixed properties  including a number of plant traits  Such constant parameter values contradict with the observed trait variation in natural vegetation  In the DGVM JSBACH  which is part of the MPI ESM  we allow three traits  specific leaf area  SLA   maximum carboxylation rate  Vcmax 25   and maximum electron transport rate  Jmax 25    to vary within PFTs via trait climate relationships  These relationships are based on a large database containing observed trait data  TRY  www try db org   and reflect ecological assembly processes  The results show that for all three traits the default model strongly deviates from observed natural trait data  with mean differences of 32 3 % for Vcmax 25   26 8 % for Jmax 25 and 17 3 % for SLA  Simulating trait variation results in a different dominant vegetation cover in more than 35 % of the terrestrial grid cells  GPP increases up to 50 %  The discrepancy between default trait values and natural trait variation  combined with the substantial changes in simulated vegetation properties  together emphasize the importance of trait variation for global vegetation functioning  Incorporating observational data based on the ecological concepts of environmental filtering will improve the modeling of vegetation behavior in DGVMs and as such will enable more reliable projections in unknown climates       
Belowground considerations in defining plant functional types  Can we characterize and represent root functional types  Plant functional type  PFT  is a designation with a long history in ecological research  Plant species are generally grouped into PFTs defined based on aboveground characteristics  including physiological and morphological traits  in order to represent the dynamic responses of plants and plant communities to changing environmental conditions as projected by climatic models at large  global scales  Belowground plant characteristics  and their similarities and differences among plant species and traditionally defined PFTs  have received less attention  and are not currently represented in most large scale models  In particular  new characteristics are needed in global models to represent the plant communities that thrive under the relatively extreme conditions  e g   cold  anoxic  typified by organic soils in wetlands and in the tundra  where a literature survey indicates that roots and belowground stems can average as much as six times the mass of aboveground plant parts  Species that colonize boreal and arctic ecosystems have a variety of belowground adaptations to cope with harsh environmental conditions  Shrubs and trees rely on shallow rooting distributions that remain above the average water table level  as well as mycorrhizal symbioses  while sedges and rushes tend to rely on aerenchyma to oxygenate deeper rooting distributions  and often lack mycorrhizal symbioses  The representation of plant species in models may be improved by characterizing belowground plant properties as   root functional types    RFTs   RFTs can then be associated with aboveground characteristics traditionally represented in PFTs  Definitions of RFTs should include root characteristics that can strongly influence ecosystem CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes  such as aerenchyma and root exudation  or ecosystem water and nutrient fluxes  such as specific root length and rooting depth distribution  These root characteristics will not necessarily be captured within traditionally defined PFTs  For example  the PFT encompassing   grasses   or   sedges   will group species which differ in aerenchyma cross section  nutrient content  root radial O 2 loss  and root exudation rates  Databases are being increasingly populated by information which facilitates the qualitative separation of plant species based on aboveground characteristics  including specific leaf area and leaf longevity  However  more data are needed on relevant belowground plant characteristics  including linkages between root anatomy and root function  as well as species specific characterization of rooting depth distribution  mycorrhizal colonization  exudation rates  root porosity  specific root length  and root lifespan  These data are necessary to determine which  if any  RFTs will improve dynamic vegetation representation in models at the global scale        
Dynamics of plant functional types at the forest tundra ecotone Arctic and boreal ecosystems contain a suite of disparate plant functional types  PFTs  that includes evergreen and deciduous trees  evergreen and deciduous shrubs of varying morphologies  tall  low  dwarf  prostrate   sedges  grasses  forbs  mosses  and lichens  In many circumpolar modeling efforts  these extremely different PFTS are frequently lumped into one or two broad categories that are not adequately precise for representing the response of vegetation to environmental changes  for example  the arctic tundra is still commonly parameterized as C 3 grassland  when grasses make up a very minor component of the plant community  Some recent modeling studies have included a more detailed representation of these plant communities  with the assumptions that PFTs respond differentially to environmental changes  and that PFTs have widely varying effects on ecosystem functions  such as energy exchange  water cycling  and carbon cycling  We briefly review PFT categorization in arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystems  and then specifically address the necessity for understanding PFT dynamics at the forest tundra ecotone  where vegetation responses to environmental change will likely have strong direct or indirect effects on important ecosystem properties  such as soil water  soil carbon  and permafrost  The latitudinal forest tundra ecotone is experiencing some dramatic changes in PFT composition that have been observed with remote sensing over the past 50 years  One seemingly widespread change is the replacement of short statured tundra  dominated by sedges  mosses and low/dwarf shrubs   with tall shrubs  e g  alder  birch  willow   This change in PFTs could amount to a three fold increase in the height of the vegetation and a variety of changes in the functioning of these ecosystems  Tall shrubs decrease albedo relative to upland sedge dominated tundra  particularly in the spring when the shrubs extend above the snowpack  They also decrease summer soil temperatures through shading and increase winter soil temperatures as a result of greater insulation  in part due to trapping of windblown snow beneath the shrub canopy   Tall shrubs will also likely increase transpiration  leading to reduced soil moisture and potentially deeper water tables  All of these functional differences will affect the soil thermal regime  with implications for permafrost and soil carbon  Additionally  there may be short  and long term changes to the understory PFT composition  e g  mosses and lichens  and altered plant herbivore interactions  The case of the forest tundra transition and other high latitude vegetation changes illustrate the importance of PFT representation in high latitude ecosystem and climate models       
Vegetation dynamics in a changing Arctic  Improved biogeochemistry response to a warming climate through a detailed representation of leaf phenology Dynamic modeling of arctic tundra vegetation requires representation of the heterogeneous tundra landscape  This includes representation of each type of tundra ecosystem  including shrub  heath  wet sedge  and tussock tundra types  as well as unique representations of the grouping of species  or plant functional types  within each of these ecosystems  such as the deciduous shrubs  evergreen shrubs  forbs  grasses  sedges  mosses  and lichens  One potential sensitive and valuable indicator of the dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change is leaf phenology  However  while the plant functional types in arctic ecosystems require differing amounts of accumulated heat for leaf out  dynamic vegetation models simulated over a regional to global scale typically assume some average leaf out for all of the plant functional types within an ecosystem  Here  we make use of air temperature records and observations of spring leaf phenology collected across dominant plant functional types in arctic and boreal ecosystems in Alaska  We then parameterize a dynamic vegetation model based on these data for tundra ecosystems  as well as ecotonal boreal white spruce forest  This implementation improves the timing of the onset of carbon uptake in the spring  permitting a more accurate study of the contribution of each plant functional type to ecosystem performance  Furthermore  this implementation impacts the ecosystem composition  and may favor the plant functional types that leaf out earlier compared to those that leaf out later in the growing season  These findings demonstrate that dynamic vegetation models should consider variation in leaf out by plant functional types within these ecosystems in order to provide more accurate projections of feedbacks to climate and plant distributions in Arctic regions       
Remote sensing of tundra plant functional types Shifts in the composition and abundance of plant communities in the Arctic landscapes due to climate change have potential effects on ecosystem processes such as net primary production and nutrient cycling  Vegetation is anticipated to be responsive to arctic warming  although there is some uncertainty as to how the interplay between geomorphic  hydrologic  climatic and other biotic will manifest over a range of spatial scales  Remote sensing provides critical tools for monitoring plant cover types or optically distinguishable plant functional types  as optical signals provide a way to scale from plot measurements to regional estimates of biophysical properties  for which spatial temporal patterns may be analyzed This talk presents results from field studies in Barrow Environmental Observatory in Barrow  AK where hyperspectral measurements were taken using a transect based tram system covering range of geomorphological units  polygon types and moisture regimes  Our results suggest that hyperspectral remote sensing can distinguish functionally distinct vegetation types and can be used to develop regional estimates of photosynthetic LUE in tundra landscapes  This work has potential implications for long term vegetation change detection in Arctic landscapes and simulating vegetation climate feedback in Earth Systems Models       
 Plant functional types in Earth System Models  Progress  plans  and future directions 	  Earth System Models simulate natural vegetation distribution and terrestrial carbon  water  and energy exchange in response to climate  soil  disturbance  and their many interactions  These models rely on the concept of plant functional types  PFT  to reduce the complexity of species diversity to a few key plant types  There are  however  competing views on how vegetation distribution and changes over space and time can best be represented in dynamic vegetation models  Central to this debate lies the question of balancing the trade offs between simplicity in our classification of PTFs  while capturing sufficient complexity in describing differences among PFTs for major ecosystem properties and processes  This is a particular challenge in deciding how Arctic and boreal PFTs should be represented and what level of complexity is required to improve representation of vegetation dynamics in advanced high resolution land models  To address this challenge knowledge gaps must be identified and modelers and field biologists must build on this information and discuss how the improved availability of plant functional trait data can potentially enable a more realistic and empirically based representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth System Models  This will include perspectives for how a suite of above  and below ground processes can be incorporated into PFTs  e g   phenology  turnover  and the possibilities to incorporate genetic diversity and adaptive plasticity within PFTs through probabilistic representation of key processes  Progress  plans  and recommendations for the incorporation of new approaches to define PFTs will be discussed       
 Raoulia australis is a pioneer cushion plant  but not a facilitator  in the Old Man Mountains of New Zealand  Cushion plants are well known facilitator species in many environments  I tested the degree to Raoulia australis is an ecosystem engineer  facilitator  or pioneer species  in the Old Man Range of Central Otago in New Zealand  I measured size class distribution  dieback  soil pH  soil moisture  rock affiliation  and species richness both inside and outside of 50 individuals of Raoulia australis   Area hoops of 10  20  or 30 cm diameter were placed on cushions and within 1 meter of cushion edge in a random direction to assess differences in species richness  Percent cover of vegetation within and outside of cushions was also assessed  If R  australis are ecosystem engineers  then abiotic aspects should differ within and outside of cushions  If R  australis are facilitators  then species richness should be greater within cushions than outside of cushions  If these trends are not apparent  then R  australis may be a pioneer species that will soon be outcompeted  Density of plants was 9 68 plants per square meter  Size class distribution showed a left hand skewed normal distribution  indicating average germination and longevity  but difficulty in persistence  Percent dieback was not related to size of the plant  R 2 = 0 0393  p = 0 17   Soil pH ranged from 6 4 to 7 1 and did not differ with plant perimeter  Soil moisture also did not differ with plant size  R 2 = 0 0096   Within cushions  average species richness was 5 9  +/  1 8 SE   and outside of cushions  average species richness was 5 42  +/  0 87 SE   and there was no difference in average species richness as tested by a T test  p = 0 80   Percent cover of species within cushions did not vary by size  but was lower within cushions that outside of cushions for three size classes  p    0 05   These results suggest that R  australis is not a foundation species at this elevation in New Zealand but is instead a pioneer species       
 Plant and soil nitrogen relationships across polygonal ground at Barrow  Alaska  A reorganization of Arctic plant communities may be a significant result of climate change that drives important feedbacks to the atmosphere and to permafrost stability  Identification and quantification of the key processes linking plant community structure and function to soil moisture and nutrient availability are essential for refining mechanistic based models of Arctic ecosystems and for linking biogeochemical cycling models to vegetation dynamics models in an integrated  coupled land climate model framework for both regional and global scales  Representation of plant function at the climate grid cell scale should be based on relationships between plant community composition and geomorphic units that are observable at the sub grid cell scale  A relevant geomorphic framework on Alaska  s north slope is the polygonal ground formed by permafrost processes  We measured nitrogen  N  in plants and soil across the moisture gradients of centers  ridges  and troughs of the polygonal ground of the Barrow Environmental Observatory  including high centered polygons indicative of permafrost degradation  Plant community composition  aboveground biomass and leaf area  and foliar N content were measured  Plant available NO 3     NH 4 +   and other nutrients were measured using Plant Root Simulators trade   The site was dominated by Carex aquatilis   which comprised 54% of aboveground plant biomass and 59% of aboveground plant N  Foliar N concentration in Carex was uniform across the site  averaging 2 6%  The biomass weighted average foliar N of the plant community across the land surface was 2 4%  but it was distinctly less  1 5%  in the dry centers of high centered polygons  reflecting the presence of the evergreen shrub Vaccinium vitis idaea   which had lower N concentration than other species  1 0 %   Vegetation N on a land area basis was well predicted by leaf area index  LAI   regardless of plant community composition  but this analysis does not include mosses and lichens  Time integrated total N availability in soil was dominated by NH 4 + except in drier locations  e g   polygon rims and centers of high centered polygons  where NO 3   was predominant  Aboveground N content increased with soil moisture and with NH 4 + availability  These survey results support the use of LAI as a scalar for plant productivity across this landscape  but increased resolution for predictions related to climate change can be expected with more detailed relationships between plant community composition  soil N availability  and plant N content across contrasting geomorphic units       
State of NEON  Where are we and what challenges and opportunities lie ahead 	  NEON is an NSF funded distributed observatory that represents the agency  s first major facilities investment in biology  The vision of NEON arose from the ecological community as a means of answering some of the most exciting and challenging questions in continental scale ecology  Designed with a 30 year time horizon and an open access data policy  NEON  s mission is to enable understanding and forecasting of the impacts of climate change  land use change and invasive species at regional to continental scales  To fulfill that mission  NEON will provide data and information to scientists  educators  decision makers and the general public on biological processes and their responses to multiple stressors  and to make infrastructure assets available to support research  education and environmental management  NEON is now in its second full year of construction  and initial deployment of instrumentation is proceeding at numerous sites across the US  By the end of 2013  initial operation of the observatory will yield provisional instrument based data from seven sites  with 13 sites to be added during 2014  Sampling of NEON  s sentinel taxa began at eight aquatic and terrestrial sites during 2013  with another eight each to begin in 2014  Airborne Observation Platform flights will have taken place over multiple sites including one campaign coincident with the NASA AVIRIS platform in southern California and another to document impacts of the100 square mile High Park fire that occurred in Colorado during 2012  With planned completion in 2017  the time is quickly approaching when the full power of NEON will be available to ecologists world wide  As that time approaches  continued engagement with its community of users will be essential for the full potential of the observatory to be realized  Here  we provide an update on the present status of NEON and discuss approaches through which the resources provided by NEON can be optimally integrated with the intellectual resources of NEON  s diverse science community  Our intent is to encourage critical thinking on how to make the best use of NEON data  create opportunities for the community to publish scholarly papers  promote use of NEON data in education  and keep NEON at the forefront of thinking across the scientific community       
 Supporting targets of opportunity in ecological research  Case of the High Park Fire  2012  The National Ecological Observatory Network  NEON  Airborne Observation Platform  AOP  plays a key role in bridging individual in situ measurements to continental scale satellite based remote sensing  The platform consists of the NEON Imaging Spectrometer  a waveform LIDAR  and a high resolution camera integrated into a single package  Two platforms will provide coverage of the NEON sites with a third platform providing reserve capability including the capability to respond to targets of opportunity such as natural disasters  The western U S  has seen an unprecedented level of wildfires in the past decade in conjunction with extensive bark beetle infestation  A major wildfire that occurred in 2012 was the 35 000 ha High Park Fire west of Fort Collins  CO  The burn scar included a range of vegetation types including lower montane foothill shrub land  ponderosa pine  and lodge pole pine forest  NEON  along with researchers from the larger scientific community  submitted a Rapids proposal to the NSF to study how prefire management and the bark beetle outbreak contributed to the fire extent and severity  The NEON AOP was flown over regions of the burn scar in August 2012 with subsequent flight covering the majority of the burn scar in October 2012  The collected data captured the landscape at the conclusion of the fire and provides a reference to determine the cause of fire severity and post fire regeneration NEON AOP data collected in support of the High Park burn scar deployment is being used to assist in developing algorithms and processing methods used in the NEON data flow  The lidar will provide a high fidelity post burn digital elevation map  DEM  of the topography as well as three dimensional mapping the burned and unburned vegetation  The provisional imaging spectrometer data will be used to produce maps of burn severity  remaining unburned beetle infestation areas  and vegetation species  The 2012 data collected will provide a baseline as the region recovers and will prove especially valuable for long term studies of the region including planned overflights of the region in subsequent years with the NEON AOP  All data will be made publically available in accordance with NEON  s data policies       
International partnership for ecological observations at the continental scale  TERN Australian Supersite Network/NEON partnership	  In Australia the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network  TERN  has established a number of national facilities including the Australian Supersite Network  ASN  to provide long term high quality ecosystem observations on a continental scale  The aim of the Supersite network is to vastly improve our scientific understanding of how key ecosystems in Australia are responding to environmental change  The Australian Supersite Network comprises a set of 10 Supersites spread across the continent  Each Supersite provides a suite of biodiversity  biogeochemical and biophysical data streams which are stored as data sets on an open access Data portal  Integration of data sets from long term continental scale monitoring initiatives such the TERN Supersites and NEON will substantially increase our understanding o f major environmental challenges such as the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems  Partnerships between TERN and NEON aim to improve interoperability and data integration between the networks allowing intercontinental comparisons and the testing of continental scale environmental change hypotheses  Areas of cooperation between NEON and TERN include the development of compatible protocols for measurement  calibration techniques  quality control and data handling  In addition to links between the Supersites and NEON  s terrestrial and aquatic observation groups  cooperative activities are occurring at the remote sensing level between the TERN AusCover facility and the NEON Aerial Observation Platform and between TERN OzFlux and the NEON Terrestrial Instrument System flux monitoring networks A typical Australian Supersite has many similarities to a NEON terrestrial monitoring core site  collecting micrometeorological flux and soil measurements and intensive data sets on flora  fauna and biophysical processes using classical field techniques and sensor systems  Data collected from the Supersites are described  formatted and indexed and metadata harvested into a central national repository to facilitate public discovery of the data  Data delivery methods have been developed to enable the release of ecosystem data while maintaining non restrictive creative commons style licensing  In contrast to NEON the Supersite network is being rolled out in a progressive manner with both the number of sites and the number of measurements at each site being increased in each Federal funding round  Within the Supersite network the current focus is on refining monitoring protocols and quality assurance measures for the next round of funding  In addition there is an emphasis on harmonization of protocols  #8232 with international long term ecosystem monitoring networks  in particular NEON which has a similar framework  scope and emphasis       
The North American monsoon macrosystem  A case study in the exploration of new ecological scales	  We are studying the internal and external forcings associated with the North American Monsoon System  which provides annually recurring climatological and ecological coherency to a large region in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern US  The spatial and temporal distribution of summer rainfall synchronizes ecological processes within this   macrosystem    Climate and ecological processes of the macrosystem are covered by three NEON Observatory sites  In order to study interactions among climate and ecology in this system we are developing high resolution  regional land atmosphere models  ecophysiological models  and an extensive past climate chronology using tree ring analyses  In terms of climate drivers  we have focused on model interactions and feedbacks among surface greening  decreased albedo  increased evapotranspiration and the regional redistribution of precipitation  In terms of ecological responses to those drivers we have focused on topographic redistribution of water at the watershed scale  with associated influences on the spread of summer active  invasive C4 grasses  In terms of validating regional climate model predictions and extension of the predictions into past time  we have focused on the use of early  and late wood portions of the annual tree ring record in Ponderosa pine  including resolution of signals in the stable isotope composition of cellulose  Low level moisture from the Gulf of California feeds the monsoon macrosystem as it develops annually and moves northward from Mexico  while upper level moisture is provided from the Gulf of Mexico  Oceanic origins appear to dominate early monsoon precipitation  while the recycling of moisture from land surface evapotranspiration is more important as the system develops  Studies to date with dynamic vegetation in a regional climate model have revealed a positive feedback on monsoon activity    enhancing precipitation recycling and driving the seasonal northward development of the macrosystem  We are validating these model projections using a suite of satellite land surface products to provide insight into temporal and spatial covariance in surface greening and monsoon activity  and to delineate interannual variation in macrosystem boundaries at high spatial resolution  Deployment of the ecophysiological/demographic model ECOTONE and the soil hydrology model CATHY  at the watershed scale have shown that the local distribution of monsoon moisture has the potential to positively influence the spread of summer active invasive grasses  Tree ring analyses have shown that the late wood signal from Ponderosa pine is capable of validating the spatiotemporal distribution of monsoon precipitation  and thus macrosystem boundaries  during the past 200 300 years       
 Generating a continental scale  systems model to explore scalar interactions within and between NEON terrestrial observation sites 	  Understanding the impact of terrestrial microbiology on Earth  s climate and ecology requires multi scale observations of the biosphere  However  to acquire and process physical samples of soil that comprise the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution to capture the immense variation in microbial dynamics  would require a herculean effort and immense financial resources dwarfing even the most ambitious projects to date  To overcome this hurdle we are combing the crowd sourced Earth Microbiome Project  s database of soil based microbial variation across the US with high temporal and spatial resolution analysis of microbial variation at the 20 proposed fixed sites that form the core of the National Earth Observation Network strategy for placed based genomic observatories  One of the key goals of this strategy is to map the multi year spatiotemporal variability of microbial communities at each location  and correlate these with detailed observed physical  chemical and biological measurements about the environment  Combined with the EMPs ~3000 soil microbial diversity profiles from across the US  these site based data will capture the changes in important microbially driven processes that need to be appropriately expressed in models to provide reliable forecasts of ecosystem phenotype across our changing continent  This is essential if we are to develop economically sound strategies to be good stewards of our country  We recognize that environments are comprised of complex sets of interdependent parameters and that the development of useful predictive computational models of both terrestrial and atmospheric systems requires recognition and accommodation of sources of uncertainty  Here we present models that combine the EMP  NEON and the Community Earth System Model to predict the microbial diversity  and functional carbon and nitrogen metabolism for the continental USA  enabling forecasted predictions up to the year 2100

A collaboration with the Ecological Research and Education Network  How does it work  Since 2009 Ecological Research as Education  EREN  has been organizing primarily undergraduate institutions in the pursuit of ecological research that is valid scientific research but also a vehicle to allow undergraduate students to participate in ecological research  The EREN Mission is to create a model for collaborative ecological research that generates high quality  publishable data involving undergraduate students and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions  PUIs   The National Ecological Observatory Network  NEON  is a continental scale observatory designed to gather and provide ecological data on the impacts of climate change  land use change and invasive species on natural resources and biodiversity  NEON is a project of the National Science Foundation  with many other U S  agencies and NGOs cooperating  Undergraduate institutions pay an integral a part of this research  The NEON Mission is to enable understanding and forecasting of the impacts of climate change  land use change and invasive species on continental scale ecology    by providing infrastructure and consistent methodologies to support research and education in these areas  Back in 2009 EREN Founders  15 ecologists  met with the NEON ecologists at an Ecological Society of America to discuss our common goals and similar missions  Following this meeting we have interacted many times with the NEON scientists and had a meeting in 2011 in Bounder at NEON  s headquarters in Boulder  CO to tour their labs and facilities and to learn about filed and lab methods currently used or will be used in the future  EREN meets 2 3 times a year at different EREN Founders home college or university and most of these meetings include a NEON scientist attending or participating virtually The departments of NEON we have interacted with the most include the Science Department and the Education and Public Outreach Department  Most of our discussions have involved the methods that EREN is using and that NEON may use in the future with the objective to have them as similar as possible so our results can be useful to the NEON project and s that NEON  s results can be useful to our more specific research objectives  such as   the effects of riparian buffers on stream temperatures    The other department EREN has worked with is the Education Department especially the   Budburst Program   and their Citizen Science website  EREN has made suggestions to NEON in regard to their undergraduate ecological education website which will teach the college students about climate change and it  s effects on our ecosystems       
Evaluating a general theory of macroecology using big data General theories for macroecological patterns have become increasingly prevalent in the last decade  These theories potentially allow predictions to be made in the absence of detailed understanding of the processes structuring an ecosystem  We discuss research testing one of these general theories  the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology  which posits that many macroecological patterns are emergent statistical phenomena  If this theory is correct  it would mean that the form of many common patterns in ecology could be unlocked simply by knowing the total number of individuals and species in a system  and the total metabolic energy use of all of the individuals  To provide the most general test of the theory possible we compare it to large ecological datasets containing thousands of sites and species  and millions of individuals Three major macroecological patterns  the species abundance distribution  the species area relationship  and the individual size distribution  are well predicted by the theory  R 2    0 8   Three other patterns  the distance decay of similarity  the relationship between the size of a species and the number of individuals  and the distribution of individual body sizes within a species  are not well predicted by the theory  We discuss what the failures of the current theory suggest for future iterations of this approach       
Geodata Crawler  A centralized national geodatabase and automated multi scale data crawler to overcome GIS bottlenecks in data analysis workflows Geodata Crawler is a GIS tool that quickly and easily tabulates GIS data quantifying landscapes associated with user provided locations  Geodata Crawler has two main components  a centralized national geodatabase with a variety of publicly available GIS and remote sensing products and an automated multi scale data crawler that collects customized data at user specified locations within the continental United States  Geodata Crawler automatically builds project specific geodatabases and delineates sample areas associated with each user specified location  providing multiple spatial scales which can be easily customized to meet the needs of specific research questions  Spatial scales currently available include  watersheds  upstream riparian zones  local radii  local riparian zones  local watersheds  point locations  linear paths between sites  and stream paths between sites  The Geodata Crawler national geodatabase currently includes data describing topography  land cover  climate  hydrology  soils  pesticide applications  roads  human populations  wildfires  and oil and gas development  The project is constantly evolving  adding new data sets and spatial scales  to meet the needs of new applications  Several projects  at various stages of completion  will be presented that exemplify potential applications of this new GIS tool for species distribution modeling  ecohydrology  and landscape genetics The Sulphur Springs diving beetle   Heterosternuta sulphuria    a northwest Arkansas endemic  is negatively related to watershed urbanization and positively related to watershed forest cover  A multi scale approach showed that the effect of watershed urbanization was greatest when it occurred within 400 meters of sample sites and that this negative effect was reduced with greater percent forest cover in upstream riparian zones  A habitat change detection tool is being developed for a managed population of the endangered American burying beetle   Nicrophorus americanus   using Geodata Crawler to automatically produce vegetation indices from Landsat imagery and to tabulate data using multiple sample radii around trap locations  Predictive maps from this data identified at least one un sampled region with suitable habitat and provided an economical method for monitoring habitat loss/gain  Geodata Crawler is being used to accumulate landscape and climate data from the watersheds of USGS stream gages in an effort to model hydrologic alteration in un gaged streams  A project is being planned for the Bluehead Sucker   Catostomus discobolus    a sensitive fish in the Colorado River basin  to identify barriers to gene flow using microsatellite data in conjunction with Geodata Crawler landscape data collected from stream paths between sample locations       
Accidental modern ecology  How a national forest inventory gave rise to new avenues in ecological research In the late 1990  s  burgeoning interest in consistent inventories of forest resources across the U S  led to Congress authorizing the U S  Department of Agriculture  Forest Service to conduct a consistent annual inventory of forests in every state  Forest Inventory and Analysis program  FIA   An examination of recent studies that employ FIA information was conducted to evaluate the impact of such an inventory program to the ecological sciences  Although the inventory effort was originally designed to monitor the management of U S  forests  data from the program has been used in a variety of emerging ecological studies including regional evolutionary diversity  contemporary tree range shifts  and forest carbon dynamics  Inventory attributes that have empowered the development of ecological sciences are  digitally available to the public online  a relational database of site/stand/tree attributes  sample/estimation methods well documented and nationally consistent in both space and time  The current state of FIA congressional authorizations/appropriations  as well as data availability and caveats  in the context of future avenues of ecological research is discussed       
Western North American landscapes offer few opportunities for high elevation tree species migration Rapid climate change represents a major threat to future forest composition and function in mountainous regions of western North America  For high elevation tree species  future availability of climatically suitable areas may become limited in mountainous regions where land area decreases with elevation  Alternatively  the climatic complexity of mountain ranges may reduce the distance species must migrate to keep up with climate change  Species distribution modeling  SDM  offers a method for assessing potential future changes in suitable areas  but the utility of SDM has been questioned  By integrating forest structural information relating to tree dominance and demography with distributional data from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis  FIA  program  we increased our confidence in the SDM approach and predict future availability of climatically suitable areas for four broadly distributed tree species in the western U S  We assessed contemporary patterns of tree demography      seedling density and proportion of species basal area that was dead  and dominance      basal area and importance value  in relation to species probabilities of occurrence      climatic suitability  to examine the potential for climate induced range shift in tree species of the dry domain of the western United States Predicted climatic suitability from SDM analyses were positively related to species basal area  importance value  and seedling density  supporting the use of SDM to describe habitat suitability of the study species  Climatic suitability of both inhabited and unoccupied landscapes surrounding established populations will likely decline dramatically for high elevation species  indicating that both species persistence and migration may be threatened  Therefore  climate change over the next century may severely reduce the extent of climatically suitable areas for high elevation tree species  while lower elevation species are well positioned to shift upslope across the region  Reductions in suitable area for high elevation tree species are so extreme that even unlimited migration would be insufficient to offset predicted habitat loss in the United States  underscoring their vulnerability to climatic change  Thus  FIA plots offer an opportunity to identify potential range change and changes to forest biodiversity  carbon storage  and hydrology at regional and continental scales       
When a tree falls  Forest inventories illustrate how wood mechanical properties influence standing to down transitions in US forests	  Forest trees represent a major terrestrial carbon pool  When a tree falls  increased exposure to soil moisture and saprobes may accelerate decay  How frequently trees fall  and associated changes in forest carbon stocks  may depend on variation in the mechanical properties of their wood  We examined relationships between of interspecific variation in wood mechanical properties and tree fall rates in eastern North American forests  To quantify variation in wood mechanical properties  we analyzed a Forest Products Lab  FPL  database including up to eight mechanical parameters  e g   wood density  modulus of elasticity  work to maximum load  and an index of decay resistance for 63 eastern North American woody species  To quantify the frequency of tree falls  we modeled the probability that individual trees  both living and standing dead  disappeared from consecutive Forest Inventory and Analysis  FIA  surveys of unmanaged forest plots  We expected that the species specific rates of disappearance  primarily reflecting tree falls  for living trees would be correlated with their corresponding rates of disappearance for standing dead trees  that both rates would be higher for species with weaker wood  and that snag fall rates would also depend on wood resistance to decay  Wood mechanical properties of eastern North American tree species were highly intercorrelated  The first principal component axis explained over 80% of the variation in the FPL mechanical properties dataset and distinguished species with dense  mechanically resilient wood  like common persimmon   Diospyros virginiana   from species with lighter weaker wood like white pine   Pinus strobus    In FIA plots  fall rates of living trees and snags were weakly correlated  R square = 0 06  and influenced by both tree size and plot location  Controlling for these factors  species with mechanically weaker wood fell more frequently  p  0 05   This effect was stronger for living trees than for snags  in part because decay appears to change the mechanical properties of some species more quickly than others  For example  hickories   Carya spp    known for their mechanically resilient wood  were unlikely to fall while living but decay quickly and are among the most likely to fall as snags  Across all species  wood mechanical strength and decay resistance together explain 60% of the variation in snag fall rates  These results illustrate how tree species   wood traits have complex influences on forest ecosystem dynamics and highlight the value of integrating diverse datasets to understanding the ecosystem consequences of trait variation       
Intraspecific patterns of conspecific negative density dependence in tree species across the eastern United States An emerging theme in the search for mechanisms that structure and maintain forest diversity is conspecific negative density dependence  Theory predicts that negative density dependence could be an important process in maintaining diversity and recent empirical evidence supports that prediction  Building on our previous examinations of conspecific density dependence  we examined variation within species in the strength of density dependence across the majority of many species   ranges in the eastern US using Forest Inventory and Analysis data  Through spatial pattern analysis and statistical modeling of the strength of negative density dependence by 2 degree latitude by longitude region  we analyzed individual species patterns and suggest possible mechanisms driving these patterns  We predicted that if natural enemies were driving regeneration patterns then signals of density dependence should be most negative in areas of higher precipitation and temperature where most natural enemies are more active  Species level analysis revealed that 18 of the 53 species had significant spatial autocorrelation in the strength of density dependence and the remainder lacked a significant pattern at the regional scale  Initially  131 species were screened  but 78 species lack sufficient sample size for Moran  s I test of spatial autocorrelation  Further analyses of the species displaying significant spatial autocorrelation found that 12 of 18 species had significant negative correlations with actual evapotranspiration  which is an index that integrates temperature and precipitation with greater values indicating warmer and wetter conditions  Only two species had significant positive correlations with evapotranspiration  The common negative correlation with evapotranspiration is the opposite of what we would expect if seedling establishment were dependent on warmer and wetter conditions  Although we are not able to definitely conclude that natural enemies are the mechanism causing these broad geographic patterns  the results are suggestive of insect or pathogen activity which tends to be greater in warmer and wetter environments  The dominant pattern follows the proposal that enemies are likely to be stronger a strong control at lower latitudes and climatic extremes control species ranges at higher latitudes       
 Predicting the dynamics of US forest distributions through data constrained  individual based demographic modelling  The geographical distributions of many species and assemblages are controlled by climate  but to date ecologists have been unable to predict how such distributions emerge from environmental and competition #8209 related variation in underlying demographic processes  Forest distributions are controlled by both the physical environment and competition for limiting resources  particularly light  These two sets of factors act upon tree vital rates to determine population dynamics in space and time  which in turn give rise to fundamental and realized geographic niches  We used repeat measurements from forest inventory plots across the eastern US to parameterize models for tree #8209 level growth  mortality  and recruitment for seven plant functional types  PFTs  across this region  We then implemented the resulting demographic models in simulations of joint stand level population dynamics across the region  By controlling for climate dependencies in growth  mortality  recruitment  and competitor performance in turn  we sought to identify the demographic processes that acted to control the limits to the distributions of individual PFTs Based purely on data for low #8209 level demographic processes  the emergent  simulated  geographic distribution of each PFT approximated its current distribution and reproduced well #8209 known successional patterns  Simulation experiments showed that temperature #8209 related increases in mortality determined the southern boundaries of three out of four boreal and northern temperate PFTs  whereas temperature #8209 related decreases in recruitment controlled the northern limit of all three southern temperate PFTs  Changes in growth rates and competitor performance had only minor effects on distribution limits  This work highlights the potential for combining models and data on demographic processes to understand and predict the dynamics of forest distributions       
Using forest inventory to understand climate change impact on tree populations Biogeographic responses of plant species to climate change are determined by the requirements of juveniles  which can limit spread to new environments  By contrast  most predictions of climate response are calibrated to adults  which may not reflect the climate that determined their establishment  Using USDA Forest Service  s Forest Inventory and Analysis  FIA  data  we analyzed the distribution and abundance of both juvenile and adult trees  so as to understand climate change impact on tree populations  First  we directly compared juvenile vs  adult distributions in geographic space based on the assumption that a migrating population is characterized by offspring extending beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite at trailing edges  The difference in juvenile and adult geographic ranges suggests whether or not species are shifting their distributions to track climate warming  Second  we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions in climate space based on the hypothesis that warm and moist climates generally benefit tree species with high turnover rates  The relative abundance of juveniles and adults in climate space identifies the environments where species have high relative recruitment The first geographic space analysis suggests that there is essentially no evidence that latitudinal migration has yet occurred for more than half of ~ 100 tree species in eastern US forests  Instead  results suggest that the majority of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction  rather than northward expansion  There appears to be a substantial migration lag behind climate change velocity  The second climate space analysis suggests that the majority of tree species are benefiting from warm and moist environments by having high turnover rates  Both relative recruitment and mortality are high in these environments  Moreover  it rejects the hypothesis of large scale northward migration  which predicts species having high relative recruitment in cold climates  Taken these two analyses together  tree populations respond to climate change not by migrating at biogeographic scales  but by having faster turnover rates  By comparing juveniles and adults using forest inventory data  these conclusions should increase concerns for the risks posed by future climate change       
The role of community dynamics in constraining regional scale carbon cycle estimates  Assimilating forest inverntory data into the Ecosystem Demography model Community processes play a critical role in shaping not only biodiversity  but also the long term feedbacks in the carbon and water cycles and the land surface energy budget  However  ongoing efforts to calibrate and validate ecosystem models have focused largely on short term fluxes and less attention has been paid to the importance of long term demographic processes  succession  and disturbance to understanding climate change feedbacks We will present the results of ongoing efforts to constrain the Ecosystem Demography model v2 2  ED2   a community structured terrestrial biosphere model  across eastern temperate forests using individual level data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis  Particular attention will be paid to incorporating the drivers of tree mortality into the ED2 model  as small shifts in mortality rates can have large impacts on both community dynamics and the carbon cycle over multi decadal time scales  We will also present initial estimates of a carbon cycle 'reanalysis' over the past decade over northern Wisconsin generated by synthesizing FIA data  tower based fluxes  and remote sensing within ED2 using the Predictive Ecosystem Analyser  PEcAn  ecoinformatics and data assimilation tools       
FIA and environmental data to model tree range boundaries and potential changes in suitable habitats under climate change Tree species Importance Values  IV  were derived from FIA basal area and the number of stems reported at plot locations and statistically correlated to 38 environmental variables  climate  elevation  land cover  and soil  with the DISTRIB model  Using current climate conditions and three future General Circulation Models with two CO 2 scenarios for the end of the century  134 eastern US tree species were modeled for suitable habitat  The output  with a 20 km resolution  interpolates habitat suitability where FIA hasn  t sampled producing a continuous grid of potential abundance  However  for certain analyses a well defined polygon delineating the species core range may be necessary  Therefore  using the core area  a continuous region of high to low modeled habitat  a semi automated method was developed to create Generalized Species Boundaries  GSB   The process uses R statistical algorithms and a series of GIS scripts to delineate boundaries by first identifying grid cells that makeup the core area and then with FIA records and other ancillary data the boundary is manually adjusted  The final smoothed GSBs were evaluated by the percentage of FIA presence and DISTRIB IVs they captured in addition to comparing areal statistics to historical ranges of the species   extent Model reliability for DISTRIB output was high  medium  and low for 55  48  and 31 species respectively  Modeled current suitable habitat for 6 to 6617 20 km grid cells contained FIA records  with   1 44% of the modeled output being suitable and not sampled  Areal statistics for the GSBs indicate that most capture an average of 85% of FIA presence even though the area is smaller than the historical range      Little  s ranges   Additionally  the GSB  s area beyond the historical range was calculated  and 98 species have between 2 95% of the GSB extending beyond the historical range  Utilizing extensive inventories  such as  FIA records and continuous environmental data sets are ideal for regression tree modeling  where relatively few samples  ~100 000 FIA plots  can be used to predict suitable habitat  Models for current and future climate scenarios allow researchers to examine potential changes in species habitat and assess regions vulnerable to losses in species abundance  GSBs are suited for analysis of colonization potential out from the core area and migrational shifts and could be used to identify outlier populations       
Network analysis unravels patterns of species richness along a climatic gradient in Spanish forests The study of species richness at large extent along climate gradients is commonly investigated aggregating local site data at coarser grain  although this technique may introduce artifacts  such as introducing spurious species co occurrences  or changing the steepness of the relationships between species richness and the explanatory climatic variables  In this work  we examined woody species richness in mainland Spain  with the main objectives of  i  examining whether  or not  climate is connected to species richness  and  ii  highlighting the effectiveness of a new technique in unfolding hidden patterns in an ecological presence/absence dataset  For this  we used data from the Spanish Forest Inventory  which describes forests at small  local scale     circular plot side of  le 25 m radius   and we introduced the   method of reflections    a network technique that redefined species richness at the local level including information about species distribution and the inter species structure in the whole dataset  integrating locally the global signal without the need of data geographical aggregation  Annual precipitation and  to a lesser extent  mean annual temperature explained large parts of the variance of the newly defined   generalized   species richness  and therefore of the whole plant network structure  The method highlighted that  at the local scales  communities in the drier and warmer areas were the species richest  while geographical upscaling of the data did not unfold this pattern  The most diverse sites followed more closely the climate prediction  while sites poor in species were more likely to deviate  The insights obtained this way strongly suggest that the method of reflections is a powerful instrument to detect main factors underlying the distribution of a certain group of species  and thus it could have numerous applications in ecology       
Comparing metrics of forest health between national parks and surrounding forestlands using data collected by the Northeast Temperate Network and the U S  Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program The Northeast Temperate Network  NETN  has been monitoring forest health annually in Acadia National Park  and biennially in 9 additional parks in New England  New York  and New Jersey since 2006  The NETN forest monitoring program uses a protocol based on the USDA Forest Service  s Forest Inventory and Analysis  FIA  program  which has been monitoring forest resources in the eastern US since the 1930s  In the 1990s  the FIA program went through a major revision  and this included the addition of a Forest Health Monitoring component to a subset of plots  The newly revised FIA protocol was implemented in 2000  By using similar methods as FIA  we can examine regional trends with the larger FIA dataset  and compare NETN park forests with the surrounding matrix of forestlands  We developed an MS Access database that contains the publicly available fuzzed  swapped FIA plot data  and calculates metrics of forest cover  land ownership  and forest health  For comparisons with NETN parks  we calculated metrics from FIA plots in the same Ecological Subsection as each NETN park  Where FIA methods were compatible  we calculated and rated the ecological integrity metrics that were developed for the NETN forest monitoring program Parks vary in the extent of forest in surrounding lands  with the highest proportion of forest around parks in New England  Forestlands surrounding NETN parks are largely under private ownership and in timber production  whereas forests in NETN parks are primarily protected from timber production  The difference in management regimes has resulted in forests in NETN parks that are distinct from the surrounding matrix of forestlands  The proportion of plots in late successional forest is higher in every park  and the proportion of plots in mature forest is higher in most NETN parks than surrounding forestlands  Indicators of older forest structure  such as coarse woody debris and large snags  are more abundant in many NETN parks than the surrounding matrix of more intensively managed forests  Tree growth and mortality rates also vary between NETN parks and surrounding forestlands  Despite their small size  forests in NETN parks may represent islands of regionally significant habitat in a sea of human development and more intensively managed forests       
Uncertainty analysis  An evaluation metric for synthesis science The methods for conducting reductionist ecological science are well known and widely used  In contrast  those used in ecological synthesis science are still being developed  vary widely from study to study  and often lack the rigor of reductionist approaches  This is unfortunate because the synthesis of ecological parts into a greater whole is critical to understanding many of the environmental problems society faces  Here the question of how the rigor of synthesis science might be increased is explored by contrasting reductionist and synthesis science in terms of uncertainty  The uncertainty associated with a result is a standard evaluation metric essential to scientific rigor  In reductionist science  measurement uncertainty      experimental s described by precision and accuracy  While rigorously determined in laboratory analyses and climatic measurements  in many field studies measurements are assumed to be acceptably precise and accurate  Natural variation in space and time is the main concern in most field studies and is characterized by repeated sampling to quantify classical statistical moments  e g   mean and variance   Many measurements are transformed into variables of interest  e g   diameter to biomass  by using relationships contained in models  Uncertainty enters at this stage of analysis in two ways  uncertainty about model parameter values  so called regression nd uncertainty about the form of the relationships  model selection In reductionist science  regression  often quantified  while model selection  generally overlooked  as one model is usually selected as the   best    Synthesis science shares all these forms of uncertainty  but perhaps model selection lready the least understood  is most important  It is important to the synthesis process because it is related to how subparts are put together  When there is imperfect knowledge about relationships or how to model there can be several plausible approaches  Therefore a key step in increasing the rigor of synthesis science would be to evaluate model selection d not to favor one plausible approach over another  By quantifying the uncertainty of synthetic science  one should be able to rigorously compare the results of one synthetic result to another and judge whether they are different within the bounds of measurement and knowledge  However  to be accepted as a standard method  best practices analogous to those used in reductionist science need to be developed and implemented       
Quantifying uncertainty in ecology  Examples from small watershed studies	  Monitoring elements in precipitation inputs and stream water exports at small watersheds has greatly advanced our understanding of biogeochemical cycling  Surprisingly  although inputs to and outputs from ecosystems are instrumental to understanding sinks and sources of nutrients and other elements  uncertainty in these fluxes is rarely reported in ecosystem budgets  This omission stems in part from the fact that each ecosystem is unique  making it challenging to identify replicate sampling units  Even in cases where replication may be possible  it is often prohibitively expensive to monitor the number of ecosystems required for an acceptable level of uncertainty  Without replication  it is still important to know the uncertainty in the measurements that go into describing ecosystem pools or fluxes  However  the calculations are complex and multiple sources of uncertainty are involved  e g   missing data  biased observations  sampling nalytical We illustrate the concept of opagation in ecosystem studies using the net hydrologic flux of calcium in a harvested and reference watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest  New Hampshire  We identify sources of uncertainty and use a Monte Carlo approach to combine individual estimates of uncertainty to produce an overall value  Sources of uncertainty in precipitation inputs that were identified and quantified in this study include  the model selected for interpolation among precipitation gages  precipitation collector efficiency  undercatch   collector measurement  gaps in precipitation volume  chemical analysis  and gaps in precipitation chemistry  Sources of uncertainty in stream water outputs include  watershed area  stage height measurement  stage discharge relationship  rating curve   gaps in the stream flow record  and leakage     groundwater losses   The annual net hydrologic flux of calcium in the harvested and reference watersheds was calculated from 1963 through the present  Prior to the harvest  the difference in net hydrologic flux of calcium between the two watersheds was within the range of uncertainty  Following the harvest  the calcium flux in stream water exports from the harvested watershed increased and have remained high relative to the reference  but appear to be slowly returning to pre harvest levels  This example highlights the value of estimating uncertainty in studies where replication is impracticable  and demonstrates how uncertainty estimates improve confidence in comparisons       
Better ignorant than misled  Including uncertainty in forecasts supporting management and policy The fundamental challenge of management is to choose actions that will meet goals for the future  Ecological modeling can play a role in supporting these choices by forecasting the future state of ecological systems under different alternatives for management  These forecasts must properly communicate uncertainty to decision makers  I describe a broadly useful approach for communicating results of ecological forecasts used to support decisions on environmental management and policy  The central problem in managing the environment is to choose among alternative actions based on their ability to meet multiple goals  goals that may compete with one another  For each goal  there is often a range of outcomes that are acceptable  Bayesian state space models provide a useful way to evaluate the ability of actions to meet goals  A key feature of these models is the ability to separate uncertainty that arises from variance in environmental processes from uncertainty arising from n observing those processes  This separation enables honest forecasts represented as the probability distribution of model estimates of future states of the system being managed  The probability of meeting goals can be deduced by calculating the area of these distributions corresponding to acceptable values of an ecological state  It is important to compare the probability of meeting a goal given some action relative to the probability of meeting the goal if we do nothing  Doing nothing serves as a null model for assessing the value of taking action  The approach has several desirable features  Increasing uncertainty in forecasts favors prudence because the probability of meeting goals given no action converges on the probability given an action  Actions will differ in their ability to meet different goals  Adaptive management and continuous evaluation of management actions are encouraged because uncertainty propagates with time  reducing the ability to make distinctions among potential actions far into the future  Model forecasts enhance the conversation among decision makers and stakeholders by plainly revealing the risks of action and inaction  Understanding these risks allows human values to enter the discussion about which actions should be taken  an outcome that is inevitable and desirable       
Global Sensitivity Analysis for Impact Assessments Results of stochastic population models are often sensitive to model structure and input parameter values  which in turn depend on our knowledge of the processes governing population growth  Sensitivity analysis is used to understand the effect of parameter and model structure uncertainty on model outcomes  A common sensitivity analysis method is to vary model parameters one at at time and observe the effect of each parameter on model outcomes separately  This type of analysis fails to account for interactions among model parameters  Several recent sensitivity analyses overcome this limitation by varying several  or all  model inputs simultaneously  and using regression techniques to measure the importance of variation in each model input on model outcome  These methods often require carrying out a large number of simulations  We investigated the use of Latin Hypercube sampling as a way to more efficiently sample model parameter space in a global sensitivity analysis  applying our method to a demographic model of an endangered shore bird whose habitat is threatened by sea level rise  We also performed a global sensitivity analysis on paired simulations  where each model was parameterized with identical randomly generated input parameters except for those parameters associated with the effects of sea level rise  e g  population carrying capacity   This analysis allowed us to calculate a relative change in model outcomes  e g  change in risk of extinction  caused by sea level rise We find no compelling evidence that Latin Hypercube sampling yields any benefit over uniform random sampling of parameter space  We varied eight input parameters related to vital rates  e g  adult survival and fecundity  and population characteristics  e g  carrying capacity   and found that a relatively small number of replicate models  approximately 100  result in consistent measures of variable importance in non paired simulations  However  using our paired simulations  many more replicate models  approximately 500  are required to yield consistent measures of variable importance on relative change measures of model outcomes  In many applications such as the one we present here  the goal of a demographic modeling is not necessarily to determine a value for absolute extinction risk  but to assess how different scenarios  management scenarios  estimated changes to ecological conditions  etc   will lead to changes in extinction risk  Our results suggest that paired simulations with identical parameters except for the fixed effect being assessed allows quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of relative changes in model outcomes to variation of model inputs as well as absolute model outcomes       
Optimizing environmental monitoring designs Uncertainty analyses can be used to improve efficiency in ecosystem monitoring efforts  We illustrate four methods of data analysis appropriate to four types of monitoring designs  using examples from northeastern North America      To analyze a long term record from a single site  we applied a general linear model to stream chemistry at Biscuit Brook in the Catskill Mountains  Biscuit Brook has been monitored continuously on a weekly basis since 1999  we simulated reduced sampling efforts and evaluated confidence in the detection of change over time      To analyze a one time survey  we applied a detectable difference analysis to loon tissue mercury concentrations  illustrating effect of sampling intensity on statistical power and the selection of a sampling interval likely to detect an expected change over time      To analyze sampling intensity at one point in time  we subsampled forest inventory plots from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest  illustrating the relationship between sampling intensity and uncertainty in the mean biomass or nutrient content      To analyze time series data from multiple sites  we assessed the optimal number of lakes and the optimal number of samples per year needed to monitor change over time in Adirondack lake chemistry  using a repeated measures mixed effects model Environmental sampling designs should maximize the information gained relative to the resources expended on data collection and analysis  Uncertainty analysis can help select a sampling interval likely to detect an expected change over time and evaluate whether effort should be re allocated in space or time to best reduce uncertainties       
Uncertainty due to gap filling in long term hydrologic datasets Most long term datasets contain gaps  which we define as missing or unusable data  In hydrologic datasets  causes of gaps include loss or contamination of samples  routine maintenance  equipment malfunction  extreme weather  and breaks in the funding cycle  When calculating precipitation inputs or streamflow outputs of water or solutes  it is not possible to simply omit missing values  Methods for filling gaps vary widely  and the uncertainty associated with filling gaps is not commonly reported  For five long term hydrologic studies  we described the frequency and causes of gaps in the volume and solute concentrations of precipitation and streamflow  To quantify the uncertainty associated with different gap filling methods  we created a series of artificial gaps  and compared the estimates with measured values  Our case studies include datasets from four LTER sites  Hubbard Brook  Coweeta  HJ Andrews and Sevilleta  in the US and Gomadansan Experimental Forest in Japan  Specific causes of missing data varied among our study sites  but broad generalities can be made  For streamflow  equipment failure or maintenance accounted for 75% of missing flow values at Hubbard Brook and Coweeta  In streamflow datasets  problems with chemical observations are less common than gaps in flow  Conversely  in precipitation datasets  chemistry gaps are much more common than gaps in volume  Over 60% of chemistry gaps in rain gauge data were due to contamination of samples  Based on a 95% prediction interval  we determined that volume and chemistry gap filling using regression models created an uncertainty of 2 8% around annual nitrate input estimates for a rain gauge at the Sevilleta  Gaps in streamflow created an uncertainty up to 8% at Gomadansan  The uncertainty associated with gap filling should be reported when using precipitation and streamflow datasets to calculate nutrient budgets  We recommend that researchers perform this relatively simple analysis to quantify the uncertainty associated with their missing data  Performing this analysis will also allow researchers to select the method which minimizes gap filling uncertainty at their site       
Uncertainty in an uncertain world  Using scientific judgment for evaluating uncertainty in measurement results The overarching question when evaluating uncertainty in a measurement is how close the measurement is to the truth   At the Calibration and Validation Laboratory  CVAL  of the National Ecological Observatory Network  NEON   uncertainty assessment starts with the truth  reference  and propagates to the field measurement  Many components contribute to overall uncertainty  but where does one draw the line for quantifying uncertainty  Here I will explain methods emulated from techniques adopted by International Organization for Standardization  ISO  and National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  for using scientific judgment in evaluating uncertainty  While consistency in expressing uncertainty is important  not all sensors are created equal in ecological observation measurements  An intimate understanding of the sensor and nature of the measurement is necessary for identifying uncertainty components  While repeatability and reproducibility are necessary components  other random ust be included in the uncertainty budget such as variable ambient temperature  long term stability  etc  Once sources of e identified  statistical analysis on experimental results or utilizing existing published knowledge of an uncertainty component can be used to quantify uncertainty    Type A and B approach  respectively  Within NEON  our aim is to provide the end user with details of all components of quantified uncertainty allowing for modified interpretation of uncertainty  This feature will allow for the separation of variance due to environmental processes and ssociated with the observation  as described by N  Thompson Hobbs   At NEON  we are striving to reduce the number of unknowns and better understand the remaining unknowns       
NEON's approach to uncertainty estimation for sensor based measurements The Fundamental Instrument Unit  FIU  of the National Ecological Observatory Network  NEON  is responsible for generating QA/QC protocols and uncertainty estimates for all of NEON  s level one      calibrated and temporally averaged  in situ  sensor based measurements  Identifying and quantifying uncertainties are the keystones of deriving statistical interpretations about mean quantities and variance structure  both are needed to construct NEON  s higher level data products  These data products will be publically available  and as such  a goal of NEON is to ensure all sources of uncertainty are identified and if possible  quantified in a traceable manner  Here  our approach for identifying and quantifying uncertainties of these level one data products is presented  It emulates the approach taken by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO   while leaving room for scientific creativity  that which can be justified  Specific examples are given to exhibit the strengths  limitations  and plausibility of estimating uncertainty  in a standardized fashion  for those data products produced by the FIU  Although sources of uncertainties can be identified  some cannot currently be quantified  especially at a high level of confidence  Much work is still needed to better understand the uncertainties of various ecological processes  e g   fine root turnover  and their associated sampling methods  e g   use of minirhizotrons   Additionally  efforts should be aimed toward minimizing specific assumptions that uncertainty analyses comprise  such as inferring human induced re negligible  This is especially important for NEON  s Observatory  as many ecological measurements will be human based  As time progresses and NEON data are analyzed  a better understanding of sensor specific  and human induced  uncertainties may arise  thus making it possible to quantify previously unquantifiable uncertainties  The presented approach serves as a standardized method by which ecological data uncertainties can be quantified  It is our hope that current and future ecological networks will adapt this method  thereby strengthening ecological datasets and promoting interoperability among ecological networks       
Estimating uncertainty for continental scale measurements The National Ecological Observatory Network  s Fundamental Instrument Unit  NEON FIU  is responsible for making automated terrestrial observations at 60 different sites across the continent  FIU will provide data on key local physical  chemical  and climate forcing  as well as associated biotic responses  CO2  H2O  and energy exchanges   The sheer volume of data that will be generated far exceeds that of any other observatory network or agency          45 Tb/year from 10  s of thousands of remotely deployed sensors   We address the question of how to develop and implement an ecological observatory that can accommodate such a large volume of data while maintaining high quality  Here  we describe our approach to uncertainty for large scale measurements with specific examples that focus on quality control while leveraging cyber infrastructure tools and optimizing technician time Results focus on novel approaches to uncertainty that advance the techniques that have been historically employed in other networks  DOE ARM  AmeriFlux  USDA ARS  OK Mesonet  to new state of the art functionality  These automated and semi automated approaches are also used to inform automated problem tracking to efficiently deploy field staff  Ultimately  NEON will build upon existing frameworks of standardized uncertainty characterization to define its own operational standards for continental scale data products  The overarching philosophy relies on attaining the highest levels of accuracy  precision  and operational time  while efficiently optimizing the effort needed to produce quality data products       
Reducing uncertainty through data driven model development   Ecological forecasts have diverse sources of uncertainty  and the value of an ecological forecast is directly related to its accuracy and precision  We apply process control and integration testing to target model development toward more precise ecological forecasts  Benchmarks and skill metrics are used to quantify changes in the uncertainty of our ecological predictions that result from changes in parameterization and model structure  This approach reduces the uncertainty associated with the addition of new features to a model by testing that the software implementation of a model is consistent with our conceptual model  Furthermore  the use of fixed benchmark data and software version control makes it easier to isolate the source of changes in model performance  This form of integration testing facilitates iterative development by providing immediate feedback on the effects of each step in model development  As an example of this approach  we will review our experience adding the capacity to simulate tree growth to an existing model of C4 grasses  BioCro   In this example  we illustrate the use of uncertainty as an empirical metric to guide efficient and effective research     The use of model skill metrics during model development allowed us to iteratively evaluate and reassess the focus of our model development efforts  Model skill improved substantially with the introduction of well established models of tree physiology  the Farquhar model of C3 photosynthesis  addition of a woody biomass pool  and deciduous phenology  Subsequent refinements were less effective at improving model skill  The relationship between effort and model uncertainty provided an empirical foundation on which to iteratively identify and reassess the focus of our model development efforts  The progressive improvments in skill helped us identify how well the incorporation of specific mechanisms improved model skill  At the same time  we could confirm our predictions of which model components are most important  and identify targets for further research       
Towards a consistent approach for assessing drought risk to terrestrial carbon stores Changes in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases are driving changes in the distribution of rainfall and temperature regimes  Warming temperatures and declining rainfall  especially in mid to high latitudes are believed to be important drivers of recent mortality events around the globe  The impacts of these events on terrestrial carbon stores and other ecosystem services is difficult to predict despite the current surge in research into drought related mortality globally  This difficulty arises for two reasons   1  it remains difficult to define the climatic conditions/thresholds associated with drought related mortality in a consistent manner and  2  because the physiological mechanisms associated with mortality are poorly resolved  Together these uncertainties make it difficult to define ecosystems and species vulnerable to future drought events  Australia has a long history of extremes in climate    of droughts and flooding rains    and provides an excellent case study for responses of terrestrial ecosystem to extreme events  In this study we are developing approaches for defining drought attributes in a consistent manner across ecosystems and use these to define future trends in these attributes and assess future climatic risks to carbon stocks  We also develop approaches for linking these drought attributes to species drought tolerance traits  providing a means to predict differential species vulnerability within and across ecosystems We used a joint probability distribution relating climatic dryness and temperature to examine historical patterns in drought related mortality using examples from mortality events around Australia  We found that historically  mortality events exceed a common threshold across sites and environments  This finding allowed us to explore trends in event statistics such as the duration  intensity and frequency of droughts capable of causing mortality under a range of future climate scenarios  Additionally we observed that these climatic thresholds are related to functional traits related to species drought tolerance  These findings provide a basis to start exploring the risks to ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity posed by future climatic scenarios  Importantly they may form the foundation for loss functions that would help to quantify risks associated with a range of climate scenarios  While it is widely recognised that future climates pose significant risks to ecosystem function  approaches for assessing these risks remain limited  Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of these risks would significantly enhance the deployment of resources aimed at managing these risks to key ecosystem services       
Pre disposing factors leading to drought induced mortality in broad leaved evergreens	  Drought induced mortality has major impacts on landscapes but is currently challenging to predict  Not only are the mechanisms of mortality still unresolved  but we also have a poor understanding of environmental factors that pre dispose vegetation to drought mortality  Bioclimatic  process based and dynamic global vegetation models must incorporate these thresholds in order to improve the accuracy of their predictions  A thorough understanding of the pre disposing factors leading to drought induced mortality is needed to predict water and carbon fluxes  and estimate vegetation boundaries in future  Here we synthesize the literature on biotic  age  plant size  stand density  stand basal area  root depth  and site conditions  microclimate  shade  aspect  soil depth and type  and species region of origin  temperature  atmospheric CO 2   drivers of drought induced mortality  using examples from South Africa and Australia  examining climatic and site specific variables correlated with mortality  An understanding of mortality in broad leaved evergreen Australian and South African vegetation will inform our understanding of vegetation from other regions  as convergent strategies to avoid water stress have been observed globally in vegetation from nutrient limited sites  Synthesis of the literature on factors pre disposing plants to drought mortality showed that not all of the pre conceptions of factors leading to mortality are supported by evidence  Many pre disposing factors had thresholds which needed to be exceeded before % mortality increased  Further  most relationships between pre disposing factors to drought and mortality appeared to be non linear  Stand density and rooting depth were identified as key pre disposing factors  with strong evidence for a positive correlation between stand density and drought induced mortality  and a negative correlation between root depth and mortality rates  The relationship between drought mortality and tree age or size had a   U shaped   curve  where young  small trees and older  larger trees died  although many studies reported no effect of tree age or size  These non linear thresholds need to be considered in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models and process based ecophysiological models  Many research gaps still exist  with some plant functional types having few results  including needle leaved evergreens  Further  more studies are needed which examine the relationship between growth rates  grazing  region of origin  elevated CO 2 and mortality rates       
The role of phloem failure in tree mortality during drought	  Failure to maintain sugar transport in the phloem may promote tree mortality during drought  Impaired transport could leave sugar stores unutilized accelerating carbon starvation  or lead to hydraulic failure through diminished capacity to refill embolized conduits  Theoretically  drought hampers sugar transport in the phloem because increased solute concentrations are required for hydraulic function next to a xylem with decreasing water potential  High solute concentration could increase flow resistance to a point where transport is impossible because of the effect of carbohydrates on the viscosity of the solution  Currently  these hypothesized impacts of drought on phloem transport remain largely untested  and their role in determining tree mortality and survival during drought is unclear  To assess how drought affects phloem function we measured phloem turgor  leaf water potential and non structural carbohydrate content of different tissues  and modeled phloem flow in pinon pine and one seed juniper trees dying of drought Our results show that phloem turgor collapsed in trees during drought  The collapse occurred on average two weeks before permanent stomatal closure  The amount of stored sugars utilized depended on how long phloem turgor was maintained  Survival time also correlated with turgor maintenance  but drought limited respiration rate to different degrees  and the longest survivors were trees that utilized the available sugar reserves slowest  At very low xylem water potentials  solutes that do not affect fluid viscosity were needed to facilitate phloem transport  These solutes could also enhance recovery once precipitation occurs  Based on these results we conclude that phloem failure is an important step in drought mortality of trees  Functionality of the phloem provides access to sugar reserves  and may prevent hydraulic isolation from the soil  but survival time during prolonged drought depends on how sugar consumption is controlled       
Carbon and energy balance consequences of widespread mortality in pintilde on juniper woodlands The southwestern United States experienced an extended drought from 1999 2002 which led to widespread coniferous tree mortality throughout New Mexico  Arizona  Utah and Colorado  Pintilde on juniper   PJ   woodlands  which occupy 24 million ha throughout the Southwest  proved to be extremely vulnerable to this drought  experiencing 40 to 95% mortality of pi ntilde on pine   Pinus edulis   and 2 25% mortality of juniper   Juniperus monosperma  in less than 3 years  Breshears et al   2005   Understanding the response trajectories of these woodlands is crucial given that climate projections for the region suggest that episodic droughts  and associated conifer mortality  are likely to increase in frequency and severity in the coming century  We used a combination of eddy covariance  high resolution remotely sensed datsets including full waveform lidar  soil respiration  sap flow and biomass carbon pool measurements made at   i  an undisturbed PJ woodland  control  in central New Mexico and at a manipulation site within 2 miles of the control where all pi ntilde on trees greater than 7 cm diameter at breast height within the 4 ha flux footprint were girdled  decreasing LAI by ~ 1/3  to quantify the response of ecosystem carbon  water and energy fluxes in PJ woodlands to widespread pi ntilde on mortality  As expected  pintilde on mortality triggered an abrupt shift in carbon stocks from productive biomass to detritus  leading to a 25% decrease in gross primary production  and   50% decrease in net ecosystem production in the two years following mortality  The girdled biome remained a carbon sink however  that was similar in strength to a nearby juniper savanna  Because litter and course woody debris are slow to decompose in these semiarid environments  ecosystem respiration initially decreased following mortality  and only increased two years post mortality following a large monsoon precipitation event  In the three years following mortality  reduced competition for water in these water limited ecosystems and increased light availability has triggered compensatory growth in understory vegetation observed in both remote sensing and ground measurements  but not in surviving coniferous trees  Changes in surface energy balance triggered by mortality are largely due to a decrease in LAI and surface roughness which decrease the redistribution of heat and energy from the surface to the atmosphere  The result is an increase in surface temperature triggered by the pi ntilde on mortality  We discuss the results in terms of feedbacks triggered by these significant mortality events on the climate system       
 Causes and consequences of bark beetle induced mortality on water  carbon  and nitrogen cycling  The recent epidemic of bark beetles across western North America has impacted conifers from low to high elevations from New Mexico to Yukon  While the mechanism of mortality from bark beetles may vary from phloem girdling to xylem blocking by blue stain fungi  mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle both appear to kill through xylem occlusion  Understanding the mechanism of mortality is required to predict subsequent impacts at the stand and larger spatial scales  We hypothesized that 1  both lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce died from hydraulic failure due to blue stain fungal occlusion of xylem  2  soil water and nitrogen increase while soil respiration decreases due to diminished root resource uptake during the growing season  3  surviving vegetation will benefit and the rate of succession compared to clearcutting or fires will increase and 4  the spatial patchiness of mortality and rapid succession will decrease the watershed to landscape level impacts of mortality  We tested these hypotheses with data from mid elevation lodgepole pine and higher elevation spruce and fir forests using Bayesian model data fusion The combination of sap flux  needle gas exchange and xylem vulnerability to cavitation all supported a hydraulic failure mechanism of tree mortality  Transpiration in both conifer species declined rapidly after infestation but gas exchange estimates of maximum photosynthesis  day respiration and quantum yield were unchanged  The Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator  TREES  model  which combines tree hydraulics  needle gas exchange  respiration  carbon allocation and nitrogen uptake  predicted a declining critical value for hydraulic failure that matched empirical measurements  The model also predicted the contrasting dynamic in nonstructural carbohydrates  living trees increased while dying trees decreased over the growing season  Ecosystem respiration decreased while soil moisture and nitrogen increased  After five years some of these dynamics are becoming similar to pre epidemic stand conditions  The respiration dynamic was not predictable from standard ecosystem respiration drivers so the model was modified to include tissue nitrogen and heterotrophic respiration kinetics  The final model was thus able to capture the dynamics in both evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange of CO 2   Our results show that the incorporation of tree mortality and ecosystem response mechanisms are required to capture the impact of bark beetle induced mortality on ecosystem cycles of carbon  water and nitrogen       
A forest is not a pan of water  Temperature and vapor pressure deficit as potent drivers of regional forest drought stress and tree mortality As climate changes  drought may reduce tree productivity and survival across many forest ecosystems  however  the relative influence of specific climate parameters on forest decline is poorly understood  We derive a forest drought stress index  FDSI  for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive set of regional tree ring records representing the three most common southwestern conifer species for AD 1000  2007  We compare the FDSI to observed records of climate  satellite derived vegetation greenness  forest inventory measurements  bark beetle attack  and wildfires to infer relationships between forest drought stress and some important mechanisms of regional tree mortality  We use an ensemble of climate projections to estimate the future trend in regional forest drought stress and place it in the context of the past 1 000 years of forest stress variability The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by warm season vapor pressure deficit  largely controlled by temperature  and cold season precipitation  together explaining an astounding 82% of southwestern FDSI variability  Correspondence between FDSI and measures of forest productivity  tree mortality  bark beetle outbreak  and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic indicator of forest vigor  If vapor pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models  then mean annual forest drought stress levels by the 2050s will exceed those of the most severe droughts in the past 1 000 years  Collectively  the results foreshadow twenty first century changes in forest structures and compositions  with transition of forests in the southwestern United States  and perhaps water limited forests globally  towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization       
Predicting mortality of Pinus edulis during drought using growth and resin duct anatomy Drought and insects such as bark beetles frequently interact to produce widespread tree mortality in forest ecosystems  However  our ability to project future forest dynamics is strongly limited because the processes and thresholds leading to tree death are poorly constrained  Tree allocation to defense may be a key element in tree avoidance of mortality  especially in semi arid conifer forests of western North America  but there are few empirical tests of its importance in predisposing trees to die  Here we document properties of vertical resin ducts in tree rings of pi ntilde on pine   Pinus edulis    and investigate relationships between tree growth  allocation to constitutive resin ducts  and mortality  We generated radial growth and resin duct time series for 102 pairs of trees that died and survived the 2000s and 1950s droughts at four sites spanning a latitudinal gradient in New Mexico  USA  We used logistic regression to generate statistical models of mortality risk from growth indices  resin duct parameters  and combinations of the two types of metrics  Recent  3 20 year  average radial growth was generally higher in trees that survived drought  and mean sensitivity    a metric of year to year growth variability    was lower  However  this result was inconsistent across space and time  with differences between trees that lived and died either marginally significant or not significant overall  depending on the growth metric  In contrast  recent  3 year  resin duct number  average size  and area ratio  the ratio of resin duct area to xylem area  were significantly higher in trees that survived  with ~60% larger resin ducts in surviving trees  Models calibrated using both growth and resin duct variables had substantially more support than models based on growth or resin duct parameters alone  with correct classification rates for top models developed for all sites exceeding 80%  compared to 70% for growth based models   Allocation to resin duct defenses appears to have been more important for tree survival during the relatively warm 2000s drought that may have had amplified bark beetle pressure  Our results point to the importance of further investigations of tree allocation to defense in order to improve understanding of tree mortality processes  and highlight the promise of using simple correlative metrics of growth and defense to improve predictions of tree mortality        
Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of process based tree mortality models One of the largest uncertainties in Earth System Models  ESMs  lies in our understanding of abrupt drought induced disturbances to terrestrial ecosystems and their feedbacks to future climate change  The primary culprit underlying this uncertainty is our limited capability to quantify different mechanisms that directly leads to drought caused tree mortality  Most current ESMs use statistical relationships between mortality and growth rate or growth efficiency  however  these models do not account for potential acclimation and may fail under future climate conditions  Therefore  there is an increasing interest to develop processes based models that simulate key components of tree mortality  One key limitation of such process based models is that the number of parameters increases to account for complex processes  which can potentially lead to large uncertainties in model predictions  For purposes of improving modeling at large scale and reducing cost of measurement at field sites  it is critical to identify those key parameters that dominate uncertainty in mortality prediction  We applied a comprehensive global sensitivity to explore the importance of more than 30 parameters that determine the mortality based on the assumption of carbon starvation  hydraulic failure  and their interdependency  under the modeling framework of the Ecosystem Demography model  Our results showed that the maximum photosynthetic rate  the minimum stomatal conductance under drought  critical carbon storage that initiates mortality  the reference mortality rate under stress as determined jointly by plant defense and insect attacks  and the minimum leaf water potential at which net photosynthesis reaches zero are all important parameters that substantially influence tree mortality predictions  Our results suggest that further study that potentially account for belowground process and the interaction between carbon and water limitation could substantially improve mortality prediction       
 Current and future effects of drought  fire and mitigation options on Pacific Northwest forests  Pacific Northwest forest diversity  productivity and sustainability are shaped by climate and anthropogenic influences  including legacy land use  These forests are among the highest in productivity and biomass globally  Climate change is expected to include warming  changes in precipitation regimes  and lengthen forest growing seasons which can exacerbate drought stress and contribute to disturbance from insects  pathogens and wildfire  These disturbance agents often occur in sequence  further complicating understanding of potential trajectories of change in carbon cycling  In addition  natural disturbances can be amplified by anthropogenic activities  increasing vulnerability of forests  There is much uncertainty about how and where to mitigate these effects at the local to regional scales  To simulate possible effects of changing climate  N deposition  and forest mitigation options  ecoregion specific parameterization and fire combustion factors in the NCAR CLM4 model  regional atmospheric forcing datasets  IPCC RCP4 5 and RCP 8 5 scenarios  and a life cycle assessment  LCA  were applied across the region  In addition  a physiology based model and decision rule analysis produced estimates of species richness and presence/absence by the 21 st century Simulations of future distribution of major forest species predict potential decline in the presence of ponderosa pine and increase in Douglas fir in parts of the PNW by 2050  and a shift in species richness to the north  By the end of the 21 st century  CLM4 simulations suggest the regional net biome production  NBP  will increase by 58% despite fire increases  indicating that enhanced productivity from a warmer climate and CO 2 fertilization compensates for disturbance losses if current management intensity is continued  After simulating typical harvest and thinning treatments intended to sustain forest carbon  and applying a complete Life Cycle Assessment  none of the thinning scenarios reduced net emissions to the atmosphere by the end of the 21 st century  The ecoregion specific model data integration and LCA provides a framework for regional analysis of future forest biogeochemistry  distribution  and sustainability  and potential effects of forest management mitigation options       
Trees maintain broad hydraulic safety margins in their trunks during drought in a temperate forest The vulnerability of trees to drought is a potential threat to the structure and function of forest ecosystems  Recent research suggests that many trees maintain narrow hydraulic safety margins and are vulnerable to hydraulic failure by cavitation  a process that has been hypothesized to contribute to forest die off during drought  But  the dynamics of tree hydraulic status during drought are generally unknown because in situ observations are difficult to obtain and are weakly connected to conditions throughout the hydraulic pathway  especially in irreplaceable organs like the main trunk  We modeled hydraulic status in the trunks of twelve trees from four species in the Duke Forest  Orange County  NC  over two years  one year with a late summer drought and one with average moisture conditions  We fit the model to observations of sap flow and soil moisture in a Bayesian state space framework and used published values of cavitation vulnerability as prior information  allowing us to simultaneously draw inference on the hydraulic characteristics and changing water status of the trees  Trees maintained broad safety margins in their trunk throughout the observation period  This finding was likely due to lower cavitation vulnerability and increased water status in the trunk compared to peripheral branches and leaves  During the drought  trunk water potential increased for most trees  The dynamic regulation of water status could be due to reductions in canopy stomatal conductance or cavitation in leaves and/or peripheral branches  We validated vulnerability estimates with correlated observations of xylem anatomy and compared trunk water status predictions to observations of leaf water potential during the drought  These results indicate that trees maintain their water potential during drought  either through hydraulic segmentation or stomatal regulation  We suggest that catastrophic hydraulic failure is not likely in the main trunks of trees in this ecosystem under the range of observed moisture conditions       
 Cultivating democracy and sustainability through collaborative ecological research  education  and action 	  Scientists and scholars have played important roles in off campus civic life that range well beyond the provision of information and technical assistance from a stance of disinterested neutrality  Drawing on historical and narrative interview data  three distinct civic engagement traditions in American higher education will be identified and discussed  These traditions engage scientists  artists  and scholars in multiple and often non neutral roles as civic educators  servants  social critics  advocates  leaders  and even organizers  The ways these roles are understood and performed have serious ethical  political  and cultural implications that are rarely acknowledged and discussed  What roles should scientists and scholars play in off campus civic life  The development and use of practice stories through narrative interviews  coupled with theoretical and conceptual tools from public philosophy and political theory  offer a means of answering this question  Research reveals that they can help practitioners of public engagement in the ecological sciences and beyond to engage in critical reflection about their non neutral commitments and their public engagement work and experiences in ways that cultivate a democratic minded civic professionalism that is oriented toward both sustainability and justice  Scientists and scholars have powerful stories to tell about their public engagement work and experiences  We need to make space for them to tell and interpret their stories with others if we are to make progress in advancing their positive and constructive roles in civic life       
Maximizing exposure of minority youths and communities to the wonders of ecological research Ecologists conduct research close to and far away from the communities where they live and teach  The activities that engaged these ecologists to pursue their career paths and the societal value of their research are not evident to most of the people with whom they coexist at their research sites  home or university communities  Although ESA and many federal agencies have been proactive in developing and funding programs to provide access for K 12 and minority undergraduates to ecological research  there is still a very limited pipeline of K 12 minority students to ecological careers  Educational partnerships between ecologists and after school programs can increase involvement of K 12 minority students in ecology work  To engage diverse audiences in appreciation of environmental research  the English/Spanish Project Wonderwise multimedia science curriculum approach showcased the research of nine women scientists  including seven ethnic minority women  The educational materials highlighted their career paths  tools and data collection techniques and explanations of how their research could help solve society  s environmental problems  Each bilingual multimedia kit contained short video clips  biographical and habitat focused   a CD ROM with motivating research inquiry functions  and five hour long educator led activities that related to the scientist  s field research Partnering with after school programs and 4 H educators has brought Wonderwise ecology to communities in 28 states and Canada  and developed guidelines for how ecologists can turn their research experiences into mind opening virtual ecology education activities that engage minority students  especially Latinos  into appreciating ecology careers  Results show minority youths expressing greater confidence with and gaining greater understanding of science concepts because they identify more closely and positively with the ecological researcher  The human connection to the researcher  s biographical video  how she became interested in environmental research and how she translated that passion for community based science into her current research activities leads the minority students in a self discovery adventure in the application of ecological concepts to solve global problems  This virtual human interaction helps raise their self esteem and empowers them to develop a scientist  s identity  visualizing themselves as future scientists  Ecologists can expand on Wonderwise ecology experiences by videotaping undergraduates in field research and uploading clips to YouTube  to be accessed by mobile phones or IPads   The undergraduates can serve as virtual ecology career ambassadors  linking the university curriculum  to the environmental justice needs of the surrounding community       
 On privilege  Being  recognizing and expanding   MSIs  HBCUs  EJ  and ESA  Why should anyone teach at a minority serving institution  MSI   Because it  s more than just a job  Within the next decade minority children are expected to comprise more than half of the nation  s students  Because many of these first generation students will attend MSIs  their impact will continue to be astounding  For instance  while total enrollment at the 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities  HBCUs  is about 300 000 or 13% of all Black students attending college and university  these institutions produce ~25% of the nation  s Black college graduates and most of the Black doctorates  Similarly  although the 450 institutions comprising the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities  HACUs  comprise less than 10% of all institutions of higher education  they enroll more than two thirds of all Hispanic college students  While the impact of MSIs  as illustrated  is disproportionately large  their impact in the ecological and environmental sciences is much smaller  Many  if not most  of these institutions do not have programs emphasizing environmental science let alone ecology  despite the fact that these very populations have historically suffered environmental impacts at disproportionate levels and are anticipated  because of lower resistance and resilience  to suffer even more as a result of global climate change impacts  Ecologists are well positioned to help address these issues  but only if they become engaged  Working at an MSI offers a unique opportunity to engage with these communities  to diversify the field of ecology  to diversify the ecologists in the field  and to profoundly influence all of our futures  I have  during a three decade teaching career at an HBCU  taught ecology  environmental science  science and public policy  and a variety of other environmentally related courses  In those courses  along with student participation in my research program  I have been privileged to interact with a large number of minority undergraduate and graduate students who have  themselves  gone on to careers in the ecological and environmental sciences  including environmental consulting  working for environmental NGOs  serving as a federal agency program manager  being a member of a state public utilities commission with focus on renewable energy and transportation  and even working as a university professor  In addition  there are numerous others currently in graduate programs and even more who  although they did not chose ecological or environmental careers  bring an environmental perspective to their work  lives  families  and communities       
Title  Synergistic benefits to environmental justice in a couple  s ecological careers at a primarily undergraduate institution	  For 26 years we have worked with citizen scientists of all ages to study and understand the influences on water quality in Smith Mountain Lake and Claytor Lake in Southwest Virginia  We have studied Appalachian Mountain streams in our area  teaching student and community groups about the Izaak Walton League  s Save Our Stream  s Program  The results of these studies helped with assessment of the water quality in the mountain streams around Ferrum and Franklin County  VA  We helped the middle school in our county  The Center for Applied Technology and Career Exploration  design an Environmental Sciences and Natural Resources Conservation module  We were involved in the Schoolyard Ecology Program for Elementary School Teachers  SYEFEST  for teacher training in ecology and have taught many teacher in service days ever since  We also have taught classes for both our local chapters of the Virginia Master Naturalist and Master Gardener programs  We have taught classes for these programs isuch as Aquatic Ecology  Wetlands  Estuaries and Streams   Basic Botany and Plant Disease and Diagnosis of Plant Diseases   and Wildflowers and Fungi   We have also worked with the Roanoke Valley Governor  s School for Science and Technology on research projects with the students for many years  These have primarily related to Smith Mountain Lake Water Quality questions  In addition we have judged science fairs there for many years  Environmental Education is an important part of our service to the community and our working together enables us to do this even better  In some of our classes  students must complete an   Enviroaction Project    in which they choose a project that serves the community  s need for a solution to an environmental problem such as cleaning the hiking trails of litter  identifying the trees along a hiking trail or organizing a recycling program at the college  When a small college is part of a community  the faculty and staff are part of the activities of the area and contribute to its overall good  Since we are both on the faculty at Ferrum College  a small liberal arts undergraduate college  the involvement in the community and community causes has always been our focus  We will describe the benefit of efforts to get involved in community groups  bring students into those settings and add environmental education to the local agenda  We will also point out the synergistic effects of doing this as a couple       
Beyond broader impacts  Finding venues and values that synergistically link academia and community Traditional academic culture holds science and scientists somewhat apart from issues that deal with environmental justice  However  the increasing need to bridge the growing divide between science and society  and the emerging imperatives for scientists to carry out broader impacts  has prompted the creation of synergistic public engagement opportunities for scientists  In 2005  I initiated a project in collaboration with The Evergreen State College and the Washington State Department of Corrections  WDOC  to bring science and sustainability into Washington State prisons  This began with a research project to address the non sustainable practice of harvesting moss from old growth forests  With the cooperation of the Superintendent of a minimum security prison  I engaged incarcerated men to help with a moss horticultural research project  The success of this program led to a science lecture series behind bars with scientists from regional universities and agencies  implementing sustainability projects  organic gardens  composting  water catchment  bee keeping   and helping with conservation projects  captive rearing of endangered frogs  prairie plants  and butterflies  in collaboration with conservation agencies  In 2008  the WDOC provided funds for this work in six other state prisons  With the support of the Informal Science Education program of the NSF  this Sustainability in Prisons Project  SPP  is now moving to a national level  Why has this project found success with such   strange bedfellows   as incarcerated people  conservationists  and academics  This work has proven to be synergistic  with benefits to all stakeholders  Prison administrators found greater social interactions among inmates  a sense of   contributing to something bigger    and enhancement of inmates   soft skills for jobs after release  Scientists and conservationists found willing hands and minds to rear endangered biota at low cost  terrific broader impacts for NSF grants  and the opportunity to engage with audiences who often have novel outlooks and questions  This project may be applicable to other segments of society that are also   incarcerated   and isolated from nature and science  e g   residents of assisted living centers  inhabitants of military barracks  The SPP exemplifies the ways that academics can approach the broader impacts requirement    not as a burden imposed by senior science administrators  but rather as an opportunity to reach different kinds of   students   and to link humans who are completely divorced from nature with compelling reasons to learn more about and be better stewards of nature    both when they are behind bars and after they are released       
The responsibilities of ecologists  Reflections on my 30 years experience with the New World Agriculture and Ecology Group [NWAEG]	  The New World Agriculture and Ecology Groups emerged in the 1970s from the Science for the People collective  A group of ecologists interested in making their science relevant to issues of social  economic and environmental justice put their science to work toward these goals  Participating in NWAEG provided me with the option of integrating my scientific and political passions  which before had been in two separate worlds  As a community ecologist with interest and experience in terrestrial ecosystems  agriculture and food systems were obvious vehicles for the integration of my ecological and political interests  In NWAEG we analyzed contemporary agriculture and the environment in order to develop and implement just and sustainable alternatives  We base our work on the premise that the recurrent problems of the human condition  including hunger  poverty  disease  and war  result from power differences between classes  genders  races  etc  Since solutions to agricultural problems are neither wholly technical nor wholly social  we attempt to integrate both technical and social approaches in our research and its applications  We seek to go beyond reforms that do not address the unequal distribution of wealth and power in the world  and reject approaches to science that pretend to be politically neutral  In this talk I will reflect on the influence of NWAEG on my academic and personal life by following my academic trajectory from working with the Farm Labor Organizing Committee in the Mid West in the early 1980s to my living and working in Nicaragua in solidarity with the revolutionary Sandinista government  to my recent collaboration with La Via Campesina and creation of the sustainable food systems initiative at the University of Michigan  Perhaps these experiences could inform and inspire the new generation of ecologists to keep pushing the boundaries of ecology  As academics we are in a privileged position in society  With that privilege comes responsibility  Letting my moral compass guide my science  and science inform my moral compass is the right way for me       
Transforming cultural clashes to justice science symbioses Frederick Buechner wrote that vocation  role in life  is where our greatest joy meets the world's greatest need  Despite our efforts to be scientists in the abstract  ecologists are more than lab or field scientists  We are  after all  members of the human community and often engage in both science and religion  The coexistence of both in a single individual can not only foster good science  but the practice of using science for good  Because ecologists are often called upon to provide our scientific expertise in the civic sphere  this combination of passionate participation and dispassionate engagement can serve us well in effective communication and bridge building  Over 83% of US people identify with a faith tradition  and the engagement of religious groups with environmental concerns has grown over the past two decades from local congregations to international religious organizations  Because surveys of such environmentally concerned individuals reveal that they trust information from scientists more than other sources on   controversial   issues such as climate change  ecologists are well positioned to reach across to faith based organizations to build even larger communities  to enable more effective outreach  to foster increased service to society and to improve informative decision making  Convinced that specialized generalists   those who understand the language and process of two fields   can be important bridge builders for society  s betterment  I completed BS  ecology  and MS  biology   MA in religious studies and PhD in physiological plant ecology/climate change  Currently  I am working in my dream job and unique niche of science/faith work with the ecological restoration and educational outreach at the Marianist Environmental Education Center  MEEC  and the University of Dayton  I am also a vowed religious Catholic sister  and committed to justice work with the benefit of community support received from my Marianist family  I've participated in developing innovative academic science justice courses in environmental justice  EJ  and ecology religion and cross cutting initiatives  e g  Sustainability  Energy  Environment Initiative at UD  and ESA  s EJ section and speaker  s bureau initiative serving faith communities  Many non profit organizations bridge faith environment issues  e g Interfaith Power and Light  MEEC  and educate with sound science  inform policy and form coalitions with kindred groups  e g  the Union of Concerned Scientists   Skills gained from these allies include  collaboration  coalition building and inspiring  effective communication of science  We are united by experiences of wonder and awe and environmental concern  Such richly diverse symbioses can equip us as earth stewards for our planet  s future       
 Designing collaborative inquiry for educational  environmental    social benefits  A case study of cover crop research with Brooklyn gardeners 	    Agricultural extension models that involve farmers in collaborative inquiry   CI   have proven valuable in developing the knowledge  skills  and communities of practice that support ecologically based management  However  little research has addressed the specific methodological dimensions of effective social learning for sustainable agriculture  or the unique possibilities and challenges of agricultural education in an urban gardening context  Through a case study of a two year CI project to learn about the ecosystem services of cover crops with urban community gardeners in Brooklyn  NY  we address the question  How can CI be organized and facilitated in an urban community gardening context to achieve educational  environmental and social benefits  The CI process involved engaging gardeners in defining goals and research questions  designing field experiments  and planting and monitoring cover crops over two field seasons  We draw on field notes  narrative interviews  and group evaluation sessions to identify project design considerations that may have contributed to positive outcomes and reflect on the key challenges of implementing CI in an urban gardening context  as well as potential strategies for addressing these challenges   A number of practices contributed to educational  environmental and social benefits in our CI effort  Engaging gardeners in monitoring cover crop plantings using checklists of agroecological indicators strengthened their knowledge of ecological processes  e g   nitrogen fixation  weed suppression  and adaptive management skills  e g   systematic observation  applying monitoring knowledge to improve practice   Facilitating opportunities for participants to share their knowledge with others  e g   field days  supported leadership development  Sustained  in person support enabled gardeners to implement cover cropping practices with environmental and social benefits  such as improved vegetable harvests with little or no chemical fertilizer  Challenges included  negotiating power dynamics in order to address community defined goals and priorities within the constraints of a discipline specific dissertation project  structuring participation to tap the educational potential of engagement in multiple stages of the research process  while limiting participants   time commitment to a feasible level  maintaining a learning community between participating gardens  providing sufficient garden by garden research and education support with limited funding for community based partners  and designing accessible record keeping forms and processes  Despite its challenges  CI in urban gardening contexts may develop knowledge and skills that support improved stewardship practices and community capacity to address broader environmental and social goals       
Implementing K*  Choosing an optimum global carrying capacity for humans Human population is on track to rise from 1 billion in 1800 to 10 billion by mid 21st century  U N  Population Division   U N  projections assume that low fertility countries will increase TFR while high fertility countries TFR will decrease until both approximate replacement fertility levels  U N  projections that fertility rates in all countries will converge imply that countries will choose some K*  allowing for stable world population  Choosing a lower than maximum possible K* as a target towards which population adjusts by intention could allow lifestyles well above subsistence levels with low mortality rates and long life expectancy  In addition  intentionally allowing space and resources for other species in order to reduce risk of ecosystem dysfunction also argues for choosing lower than maximum possible human population levels  This paper discusses three questions  1  How should humans go about choosing K*  an ideal level for human populations  2  What K* choice might emerge from such a process  we present several alternative K* choices based on differing criteria for determining optimum population levels   3  What institutional  cultural  legal  economic  policies would be appropriate and feasible to help adjust human fertility/mortality rates in order to move towards and maintain population levels near KWe posit considerations for determining a purposefully chosen K* for particular countries  These include cultural preferences regarding the tradeoffs between numbers of children and higher standards of living  valuation of the natural environment  tolerance for risks of overshoot and collapse  assessment of resources limits  including climate change  and other factors  Experience provides a set of strong arguments for population reduction and as set of tools that have proven effective in reducing fertility rates  Application of these tools is highly country or region specific and so the demographic transition cannot be regarded as an automatic outcome of modernization but rather requires intentional policies and programs to reduce fertility  The good news is countries with nearly 50% of world population have achieved below replacement fertility levels  The bad news is cultural obstacles to fertility reduction are difficult to overcome in the remaining high fertility countries  There is need to integrate the concerns of ecologists who most closely monitor and study effects of human populations on ecosystems with the policies and programs emerging from demographics and economic development efforts  Economists calling for growth as a solution to low incomes fail to appreciate the K* concept       
Biotic responses to shifting ecological drivers in a desert community Ecological forecasting depends critically on understanding the temporal dynamics of ecological systems  Decades of long term research have helped us to map out the range of dynamics ecological systems can express  but a framework for understanding these dynamics still eludes us  Predicting temporal dynamics is challenging because many ecological changes can be traced to complex responses to underlying changes in ecological drivers  Since most ecological theory either explicitly or implicitly assumes drivers are in steady state  the ability to apply theory to nature is currently limited  However  both short term and long term shifts in ecological drivers can generate important biotic responses that can change the expected trajectory of an ecosystem  Understanding the biotic consequences of short term and long term changes in ecological drivers is an important step for predicting ecological dynamics  For thirty six years  experimental and observational research has been conducted at a study site near Portal  AZ  Experimental manipulation of desert rodents has highlighted the role of granivory and competition as important drivers structuring the plant and animal communities  Additionally  precipitation is an important climate driver in desert ecosystems and regional changes in precipitation patterns have had dramatic and complex impacts at this long term study site  Here I will use this study system to examine the important role shifting drivers play in ecological dynamics and highlight two theories   niche opportunities and regime shifts   that show promise for linking shifting ecological drivers with biotic responses At this study site  both short term and long term shifts in drivers have had important and long lasting impacts on the structure of this desert ecosystem  Short term fluctuations in biotic and climatic drivers created a window of opportunity that resulted in the rapid increase in the abundance of an invasive plant species that quickly became a dominant species  These dynamics were consistent with the concept of niche opportunities  which posits that invasion success is a function of the abundance of resources and enemies  Long term shifts in precipitation resulted in reorganization of plant and rodent communities  This created long term shifts in community structures and changed the dynamics of ecosystem responses to the underlying climate driver  While currently focused on non linear responses of ecosystems to small changes in drivers  concepts from regime shift theory may be useful for understanding ecosystem dynamics in response to long term shifts in ecosystem drivers       
Climate driven acidification in lowland Neotropical streams  Insights from a 25 year dataset on ground water   surface water interactions The current focus of our NSF LTREB Project is to examine the extent to which stream ecosystems are resistant and/or resilient to climate driven acidification in a lowland Costa Rican rainforest  Our overarching LTREB objective is to understand the ecological consequences of ground water   surface water interactions  We initially focused on identifying and validating stream solute patterns at multiple temporal/spatial scales and this has transitioned to understanding underlying mechanisms and ecological consequences for ecosystem functioning  During the first decade of the project we examined ecological effects of high phosphorus  up to 400 ug SRP L 1  in streams that receive regional groundwater through natural inter basin transfers  We found that high phosphorus stimulates microbial activity and alters stoichiometric relationships throughout the food web  Regional ground waters are also rich in bicarbonates and thus increase stream buffering capacity  Our current focus has evolved over the past 15 years by responding to new data  pH declines  and making additional measurements of physical/ chemical parameters on both short  hourly  and longer  monthly  time scales Climate forecasts for Central America predict increased variability in annual precipitation resulting in more severe dry seasons  Our long term  25 + yrs  study of stream chemistry has shown that pH declines occur in solute poor streams at the onset of the wet season each year  with the magnitude of acidification inversely related to dry season rainfall totals  A particularly severe dry season  associated with the 1998 ENSO event  resulted in pH declines from 6 to 4 for a period of several months  In contrast  streams that receive bicarbonate rich regional groundwater are buffered against pH declines  creating a spatial and temporal mosaic of stream chemistry  The diatom community in poorly buffered streams is characterized by acidophilic taxa  in contrast to euryhaline taxa in solute rich streams  Larval Chironomidae are dominant across all streams  with no seasonal or inter annual variation related to in situ changes in stream pH  and larval growth rates are not altered in response to experimental reductions in pH  3 4  in laboratory studies  Findings suggest that the biotic community in poorly buffered streams is tolerant  or essentially pre adapted  to seasonal pH declines  conferring some degree of resistance to the stream ecosystem  Moreover  buffered streams  located in lower parts of the drainage  may serve as refugia during severe declines in pH  Continued investigations will contribute to a more predictive understanding of ecosystem resistance and resilience in response to future environmental change       
From cows to carbon to curation  The biography of the Shortgrass Steppe LTER The biography of a long term  interdisciplinary project can inform current and future generations about how scientists integrate long term monitoring  experimental design  modeling  and data synthesis to support innovative research and education  A long term place based research effort  such as the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research  SGS LTER  project  also affords access to a deeper knowledgebase on how scientists lead interdisciplinary teams and cultivate collaborations  It can also provide rich contextual metadata that can facilitate data discovery and re use  Unfortunately  this knowledge is often lost and those lessons must be re learned by succeeding generations of researchers  After thirty years of continuous interdisciplinary research on the shortgrass steppe of eastern Colorado  the SGS LTER is being decommissioned and will no longer be funded after 2014  This important local knowledge appears in no textbooks or journal articles  We gathered and analyzed the experiences and tactical know how of SGS LTER scientists  staff  and alumni  by compiling their personal reflections of their work in a narrative entitled The biography of the Shortgrass Steppe LTER  Stories arising from over three decades of interdisciplinary research on the shortgrass steppe contributed a rich legacy of world renowned theory in grassland ecology  ecosystem modeling  natural resource management  and K 12 education and outreach  We conducted over twenty interviews with scientists and research support staff  and presented themes and artifacts that related to the evolution of research at the site and within the LTER Network  The interviews elicited diverse views and accounts of career building within the SGS in particular  and the LTER Network in general  This provided insight on science leadership and institutional context  and approaches to conducting collaborative research over the long term  The resulting stories captured underlying assumptions about the evolving conceptual models of the ecosystem  revealed fortuitous incidents that helped shape new directions in the scientific process  and explained changes in methodologies over time  Emerging themes from these stories about the SGS LTER project revealed deep roots in the International Biome Program  a critical role during the establishment of the Network  and abundant collaborations across the LTER community  They also revealed that over the course of 30 plus years  SGS has produced many valuable research findings  pioneered education and outreach programs  and formed deep connections with local stakeholders  Identified themes were woven into a rich tapestry of narratives  including insights about conducting science over the long term as research foci changed and the LTER Network expanded       
Dynamic responses to habitat fragmentation in a prairie plant The tallgrass prairie of central North America is extremely fragmented  It is generally unknown if small and isolated remnant populations will persist  Since 1995  I have investigated the roles of demography  genetics  and their interaction in population persistence  using a prairie plant that serves as a model for advancing basic population biology and applied conservation biology in changing and fragmented habitats  The narrow leaved purple coneflower  Echinacea angustifolia   was once abundant in the plains and prairies but now is confined to small remnants  My study area is 6400 ha in rural western Minnesota dominated by conventional agriculture  Remnant populations persist on steep hills and other areas that escaped the plow  Echinacea exhibits characteristics typical of many native prairie plants  including self incompatibility  longevity  reproduction by seed  and pollination by generalist bees  Furthermore  reproduction in Echinacea is limited by receipt of compatible pollen and declines dramatically in isolated plants and in small populations  Three fundamental constraints to reproduction that are hypothesized to be exacerbated in fragmented habitat include pollinator scarcity  scarcity of compatible mates  and flowering asynchrony between potential mates  Using observations  experiments  and modeling approaches  I have quantified spatial patterns of reproduction and tested these three hypothesized mechanisms for reproductive failure Of the three mechanisms proposed to cause reproductive failure in fragmented habitat  mate scarcity overshadows the others  Reproduction declines when nearby flowering plants are mating incompatible  a plant rejects pollen that shares a mating type allele   Over time  models predict that this genetic based Allee effect will strengthen as genetic drift reduces numbers of mating type alleles  Remarkably  reproduction in Echinacea is not limited by pollinator visitation  In a two year study  the most isolated plants reproduced the least  yet were visited most frequently by pollinators  Emerging evidence about the role of flowering asynchrony in reproductive failure suggests that its effects may be comparable in magnitude to spatial effects and likely depend on the density of flowering plants  In sum  living in fragmented habitat imposes substantial constraints to reproduction in Echinacea due to a scarcity of nearby  synchronously flowering  and compatible mates  Insights from each of these studies have helped define research questions  such as current questions about how prescribed burns and inbreeding depression influence constraints to reproduction in Echinacea   I will discuss how the duration of these studies impacts their contribution to basic population biology and applied conservation biology       
Critical thresholds and recovery of Chihuahuan Desert grasslands  Insights from long term data	  Desertification and other harmful state transitions in drylands are expected to accelerate with global change  Ecologists are called upon to devise methods to anticipate critical thresholds and promote recovery of desired states  As in other drylands  transitions in semiarid grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert involve the loss of perennial grasses and their replacement by shrubs  Dryland applications of critical threshold theory suggest that as large vegetated patches become fragmented  the breakdown of soil resource mediated feedbacks between patch size and plant survival/reproduction will accelerate vegetation loss and preclude recovery  Thus  metrics reflecting gradual changes in vegetation patch size might be used as indicators of critical thresholds and recovery trajectories  We use 100 years of observations at the Jornada Experimental Range and Jornada Basin LTER to ask  how can critical thresholds and recovery be more effectively managed Historical data indicate that the rapid loss of the dominant perennial grass   Bouteloua eriopoda   initiated instances of state change  The shift to a persistent reduced B  eriopoda state was caused by the confluence of several factors including grazing management that emphasized forage use rather than the viability of the B  eriopoda   delayed cattle destocking at the initiation of a severe  multi year drought period  and an episode of windy conditions that produced severe soil erosion  A 13 yr pulse perturbation experiment sought to recreate the rapid extinction of B  eriopoda via heavy cattle grazing  but failed to do so  Even when B  eriopoda cover was reduced to very low levels  critical thresholds were not crossed and recovery rates were a linear function of existing B  eriopoda cover  Sequences of wet years promote recovery  Patch size metrics did not improve the prediction of recovery rates and were highly correlated with cover  In contrast to theoretical assumptions  measurements of B  eriopoda reproduction across a range of patch sizes indicated that the largest patches did not feature the greatest rates of plant reproductive success and suggested that a balance between competition and facilitation might govern B  eriopoda recovery  The combination of historical reconstruction and experimental results indicates that 1  B  eriopoda grasslands undergo catastrophic transitions under certain combinations of drivers  2  transitions are not associated deterministic thresholds or proposed mechanisms reflected in theoretical models  recovery can occur with grazing rest at very low cover values  and 3  cover can be an effective indicator of vulnerability to transition       
Long term studies as frameworks for peering into the future  Climate forcing and ecological response in a set of Wisconsin lakes	  In this presentation we draw on research from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research program in Wisconsin to show how long term studies can provide a framework for predicting future ecological change  In particular  we focus on how climatic forcing has led to quasi cyclical patterns of lake water levels over the past 75 years and how  in turn  these changes in water level have influenced lake ecology  We use downscaled climatic projections to assess likely scenarios for future water levels and subsequent ecological response  Over the 75 year period of observation  water levels of northern Wisconsin seepage lakes have fluctuated with a dominant period between successive low water periods of approximately 13 years and an amplitude of approximately one meter  In some lakes low water levels expose critical habitat and thus alter ecological dynamics  For example  in Sparkling Lake  cobble habitat preferred by crayfish is lost during low water periods  Long term records show that the abundance of Orconectes rusticus   an invasive crayfish species that decimates macrophyte beds  declines during low water periods owing to reduced recruitment  Similarly  in Little Rock Lake  littoral woody habitat formed by dead trees that have fallen into lakes is exposed during periods of low water levels  This habitat is critical for littoral fish foraging  recruitment  and growth  The loss of this habitat has been associated with declines in forage fish abundance and reduced growth of top piscivores  Fish and crayfish are important elements of littoral food webs  and changes in their abundance resulting from water level fluctuations can have strong effects on ecological processes in lakes  The most recent low water period in northern Wisconsin  1999    present  was more prolonged and severe than previous cycles  Downscaled climate projections suggest that over the next 50 years  we can expect increases in both water temperature and evaporation rates causing water levels of seepage lakes to decrease by up to an additional 1 2 meters  Given past observations of ecological change observed during periods of low water level  we predict that these changes in climatic forcing will have important  complex  and non linear effects on the ecology of littoral zones       
Negative and positive effects of climate change on the demography of a subalpine perennial plant Climate change may affect plant demography through both direct and indirect pathways  Advancement of spring snowmelt is an important dimension of climate change in high altitude ecosystems  Early snowmelt is associated with reduced floral abundance of several subalpine plant species at our study site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains  including our study species  Helianthella quinquenervis  aspen sunflower   Early initiation of flower buds increases their susceptibility to damaging spring frosts  over 90% of H  quinquenervis flowers are lost to frost in some years  While this indicates a negative effect of climate change on reproduction  compensatory responses because of reduced costs of reproduction may allow frost damaged plants to redirect resources to growth and survival  In addition  the longer growing seasons associated with earlier snowmelt may further enhance vegetative growth and development  Thus  climate change could impose a complex combination of positive and negative demographic effects on H  quinquenervis and other long lived perennial plant species  Using 15 years  1998 2012  of H  quinquenervis demographic data  we evaluated how the timing of snowmelt affects growth  survival  and regeneration  We then combined these demographic effects in an integral projection model to assess how climate change is affecting the population dynamics of this plant species Earlier snowmelt was associated with increased plant size  number of meristems  in the following year  supporting the hypothesis that longer growing seasons associated with climate change have a positive effect on plant growth  There was no evidence for a direct effect of the timing of snowmelt on plant mortality  A positive relationship between floral abortion and plant size in the following year supports the hypothesis that floral abortion in response to frost damage enhances plant growth  via reallocation of resources  Costs of reproduction may therefore impose a trade off between growth and reproduction  and plants may be able to redirect resources to other structures in the event of frost damage  Here we provide evidence for two positive effects of climate change on plant growth  directly via longer growing seasons and indirectly via reallocation of resources from developing flower buds lost to frost damage  This study highlights the value of long term demographic data for generating insights into the ecological effects of climate change       
Avian community and population processes in a dynamic Amazonian landscape  Lessons from 30 years at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project For decades  researchers have studied fundamental questions of how Amazonian biodiversity is maintained  and whether that diversity can persist as Amazonian forests are increasingly perturbed  Our approach to addressing these questions has changed  however  as theory and empirical understanding have developed  The long history of avian research at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project  near Manaus  Brazil  reflects these changes  When the project was developed  in the late 1970s  the focus was informed by island biogeography theory  how does patch size influence abundance and number of species  Through the 1990s  landscape dynamics  not just patch size  were increasingly integrated into results as second growth developed in deforested areas  Now  we consider patches and matrix together  and are beginning to address the differences in not just community composition  but also biological processes  in recovering second growth  as well as in fragments and continuous forest  Our challenge now is to determine under what conditions remnant patches and developing second growth can support not just the rich diversity of Amazonian rainforest species  but also their population processes and emergent community properties In the short term following isolation  standardized sampling of understory birds in 1   10   and 100 ha forest fragments revealed expected area effects on extinction and abundance  but other patterns emerged with longer term sampling  Birds differentially recolonized fragments based on treatment of the matrix following deforestation  returning much faster through matrix that was never burned  These landscape effects mostly disappeared after about 20 years of second growth development  Now  some 30 years following isolation  we know that many species appear and disappear repeatedly from fragments  although we have identified others that never returned after their in initial extinction in the 1980s  Thus the species present in fragments are mainly determined by turnover  not by long term attrition of species  Birds moving through second growth and using small fragments include young birds probably originating in continuous forest  but some species persist in fragments through local recruitment  Reduced social organization in fragments and second growth  as revealed by interaction network analysis  is consistent with high transience and with long term changes in physical structure of fragment vegetation  Describing these responses  and especially the temporal scale at which they occur  would have been difficult or impossible without long term sampling       
Reconfiguration of a benthic assemblage after drought  outcomes from a long term study where native species lose and invasive species win	  Climate change may have great effects on biodiversity at different ecological levels and spatial scales  Recently  there is also evidence that an increase in extreme climatic events can be particularly important in ecological  social and economic terms  Indeed  extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods are predicted to become more intense  more frequent and longer lasting  In this study a long data set  from 2004 to 2012  assessing the annual dynamics of the molluscan fauna present in the River Minho  NW of the Iberian Peninsula  provided us with an opportunity to show the consequences of the strong 2005 drought on this faunal group  The main aim of this study was to give a perspective of the impacts provoked by this disturbance and their devastating consequences in the native molluscan fauna and how an invasive species can take advantage of this situation  In addition we aim to  i  determine the extent and nature of change in the molluscan assemblage as a result of this disturbance in terms of density  biomass and diversity  ii  determine the species resilience and iii  discuss possible implications in terms of conservation and ecosystem functioning  The resulted effects of the 2005 drought were responsible for significant alterations in the molluscan fauna  e g  distribution  diversity  density and biomass   After 2006 native species such as Bithynia tentaculata  Lymnaea peregra  Valvata piscinalis  Anodonta anatina   Pisidium amnicum  Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus decrease significantly without any sign of recovery  whereas the invasive species Corbicula fluminea rapidly recovers from this disturbance  According to our results  the 2005 drought was responsible for a complete alteration of the molluscan fauna present in this river with important changes in ecosystem processes and functions  A related trend could take place in similar aquatic ecosystems and future ecological and conservation studies have to include the impacts provoked by strong droughts and the possible interactions with non indigenous invasive species  Indeed  the resilience of native mollusc species to drought appears to be very low and since future climatic scenarios predicted an increase in the frequency and severity of this kind of disturbance several of these native species are threatened with local extinction       
Stability of Caribbean coral reef communities quantified by long term monitoring and autoregressive models Dramatic changes in coral reef assemblages in the Caribbean have been observed over the past several decades  Hurricanes  coral bleaching  sedimentation  herbivore die offs  and ocean acidification are some of the biotic and abiotic phenomena thought to be challenging the health of coral reef communities  Will novel environmental conditions decimate coral reef communities  or will new assemblages of coral species emerge that are more robust to the disturbances that future environments may hold  To investigate this question  we fit autoregressive time series models to data from 20 years of coral reef monitoring in Great Lameshur Bay  St  John  USVI  Data characterize cover of scleractinian corals  macroalgae  bare space  coralline algae and turf  and are available for three habitats experiencing similar disturbance regimes  Model fits are used to quantify the temporal stability of each coral reef community  and to characterize the impacts of hurricanes and bleaching events on coral cover Model fits generate two measures of stability of coral reef communities  First  community stability can be measured by long run variance in coral cover in each habitat  Second  community resistance can be measured by changes in projected long run average coral abundance under anticipated environments  Model fits predict that overall coral cover will decline as oceans warm and hurricanes become more frequent  and that temporal variance in coral cover will increase  More surprisingly  however  results suggest that the resistance of coral communities to both ocean warming and hurricane frequency vary considerably across habitats  even within a confined basin of several square km  Local scale differential resistances of coral assemblages to environmental challenges suggest that a regional scale views of coral assemblages  whereby losses in one habitat have the potential to be balanced by larval recruitment from other habitats  may provide an ecologically felicitous framework for projecting regional responses of coral reef communities to environmental change       
An adaptive dynamics approach to sex ratio evolution in demographic two sex models	  The evolution of sex ratio  the ratio of male to female births in an individual  s offspring production strategy  is a frequency dependent process that selects against the more frequent sex  One useful approach for studying frequency dependent selection is adaptive dynamics  a phenotype based framework that views evolution as a series of invasions by rare mutants  Because reproduction is shaped by the entire life cycle  studies of sex ratio may benefit from the use of an explicitly demographic two sex model  Here  we present a demographic approach to sex ratio evolution that combines adaptive dynamics with nonlinear  frequency dependent  matrix population models  These   matrix based adaptive dynamics   methods allow the incorporation of any relevant population structure  including multiple sexes  into evolutionary projections  We have analyzed a series of two sex  frequency dependent matrix population models in order to characterize potential outcomes for sex ratio evolution  We find and classify multiple evolutionary scenarios  including evolutionary stable strategies resistant to invasion and branching points leading to phenotypic divergence  These matrix based adaptive dynamics methods lend insight into alternative evolutionary outcomes in two sex populations and can be similarly applied to other demographically structured populations with linear or nonlinear dynamics       
 Mate finding  Allee effects  and selection for sex biased dispersal  Dispersal is a complicated behavior that involves decision making in three distinct stages  when to leave  where and how far to travel  and when and where to settle  Yet within the theoretical literature  dispersal is often modeled as a simple trait  without explicit consideration of the decisions individuals make in any of these stages  For sexually reproducing organisms  an important factor in the settling decision is the location of suitable mates  Difficulty finding mates can lead to an Allee effect where lower population growth occurs at low densities  Surprisingly there is little overlap between research on movement to find mates and movement to disperse  and theory from each of these fields even generate opposing predictions  Here we develop a two sex individual based model to examine the evolution of settling behavior by bridging the mate finding and dispersal literature  We determine under what conditions sex biased dispersal evolves  and see if dispersal can help a population to overcome an Allee effect Our model includes a parameter that controls how 'sensitive' individuals are to the local sex ratio when deciding when to settle  allowing us to replicate both seemingly contradictory predictions from the mate finding and dispersal literatures  When sensitivity is high  we observe sex biased dispersal  where either males or females move to find mates  matching the mate finding literature finding   When sensitivity is low  we observe no sex bias in dispersal and a correlation in distance between the sexes  matching the dispersal literature finding   Finally we show that under some conditions movement can help a population overcome a mate finding Allee effect  but in other conditions movement can actually exacerbate the Allee effect       
Pair formation mechanisms and their effect on invasion dynamics A key descriptive statistic of an ecological invasion is the speed with which it spreads across the landscape  the invasion speed  In general  the invasion speed depends on the vital rates  growth  survival  fecundity  etc   and dispersal rates of individuals  These rates vary from individual to individual and much of that variability can be attributed to the individual's life history stage  Ecologists have incorporated these stage specific differences into integrodifference matrix population models from which they can compute the invasion speed  and the sensitivity of the speed to changes in the vital and dispersal rates  Vital rates and dispersal rates also vary according to an individual  s sex  and for many animal species  fertility depends on the formation of breeding pairs  which in turn depends on the relative frequency of the sexes  Nevertheless  existing age structured models consider only one sex  We have developed an invasion model that accounts for both the age  and the sex structure of the population  and includes the pair formation process and sex bias in the vital and dispersal rates  We have derived  and will present  a formula for the invasion speed obtained from the model using linear approximations  Our comparison of this formula with the results of numerical simulations suggests that the formula is correct for a class of reasonable nonlinear models as well  Using the formula  we will show that the invasion speed depends in complex ways upon the model parameters and on the nature of the pair formation process that governs mating       
Slowing down a sex structured invasion Understanding and predicting range expansion are key objectives in many basic and applied contexts  Dispersal is a key driver of range expansion  Among dioecious organisms  dispersal is often sex biased  with females and males moving different distances  Sex biased dispersal could alter the sex ratio at the expansion's leading edge  However  demographic stochasticity could also affect leading edge sex ratios  even if there are no deterministic differences between female and male dispersal  Whether demographic stochasticity dampens or amplifies the influence of sex biased dispersal  and how this might inform strategies for managing invasive range expansion  remain open and important questions  I used insects in laboratory mesocosms to test the effects of sex biased dispersal on range expansion  and a simulation model to explore interactive effects of sex biased dispersal and demographic stochasticity  I also examined whether these factors affect the efficacy of alternative management strategies  targeted local extinctions  for decelerating sex structured range expansion  Sex biased dispersal created spatial clines in the sex ratio  which influenced offspring production at the front and altered invasion velocity  Increasing female dispersal relative to males accelerated spread  However  I also found that demographic stochasticity can weaken the influence of sex biased dispersal  especially when sex differences are small  Sex biased dispersal and demographic stochasticity both affected where in the expanding wave local extinctions cause the greatest deceleration in spread  These results provide the first experimental evidence for an influence of sex biased dispersal on invasion velocity  highlighting the value of accounting for sex structure in studies of range expansion       
The many consequences of polyandry for population dynamics Polyandry  by elevating sexual conflict and selecting for reduced male care relative to monandry  may exacerbate the cost of sex and thereby seriously impact population fitness  On the other hand  polyandry has a number of possible population level benefits over monandry  such as increased sexual selection leading to faster adaptation and a reduced mutation load  Here  I review some of the many ways in which fitness is affected by polyandry  and discuss how this might influence population dynamics I conclude that it is far from clear whether polyandry has a net positive or negative effect on female fitness  or if its individual level effects will have visible demographic consequences  In populations that produce many more offspring than can possibly survive and breed  offspring gained or lost as a result of polyandry may not affect population size  Such ecological   masking   of changes in population fitness could hide a response that only manifests under adverse environmental conditions  e g  anthropogenic change   Empirical studies could seek to determine the net effect of polyandry on population dynamics  and future models could seek to clarify the link between individual and population fitness       
When males matter  The circumstances when males generate a large eco evolutionary dynamical signature Sex structure is commonly omitted from population modelling in favour of mathematical tractability  with the assumption that female only models accurately capture the dynamics of the total population  This assumption is probably violated in many mammal populations where sexes differ in demographic rates and morphology  Several scenarios exist where female population development can be affected by abundance of males in different ages or stages  The commonest is when male abundance limits female reproduction  This occurs either through a lack of mates so that some females cannot breed  or through a lack of high quality mates so that some females have fewer or lower quality offspring  Other scenarios are when male abundance influences female survival or condition  or the offspring sex ratio  Here we present a recently developed two sex integral projection model  IPM  that incorporates sex differences in demographic rates and morphology  as well as male abundance effects  IPMs track the population level distribution of quantitative characters like size or body weight     stage or condition   They project the number of individuals with different character values by using relationships between the character concerned and demographic traits     survival and reproduction  alongside character transition rates     development  offspring character   Fundamental quantities underpinning population ecology  evolutionary biology and life history can be calculated from the model  Furthermore  input functions can be systematically altered to compare unperturbed model predictions with perturbed ones  thus simulating outcomes under changed conditions  Therefore  perturbation analyses of two sex IPMs allow us to do two things  Firstly  study the circumstances where males matter for population dynamics by manipulating male survival or character development rates  paternal effects on offspring number or phenotype  or mating pair formation  Secondly  we can simulate eco evolutionary responses to environmental change in species with sex differences in life history and morphology and intersexual abundance effects  Here we illustrate both applications using results from two mammal populations  Columbian ground squirrels and African lions  Our model performed well at predicting key population features  For the ground squirrels we found that male abundance and mating patterns influence population growth rate  For lions we show that the population is likely to respond to environmental change with complex eco evolutionary dynamics  In addition we illustrate how male abundance in lions can affect female infant survival because removal of adult males exacerbates infanticide  We conclude by highlighting the potential of two sex IPMs as a new approach to address biological questions arising from intersexual effects       
Estimating cougar population trends in Oregon with integrated population models Cougar   Puma concolor   populations have increased substantially in many areas of the western U S  since the mid 20 th Century  Coupled with an increasing human population and distribution  increased levels of interactions and conflicts with cougars have occurred in some areas  Our objectives were to predict historical trends in population size and structure from age at mortality data collected in Oregon  Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife currently uses a deterministic population reconstruction model  we developed a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that could fully account for variability in input data and provide credible intervals for final predictions  We used mortality data collected through the state agency mandated check in process that described sex  age  and location of cougars killed by humans during 1987  2009  We developed models that allowed both harvest and other anthropogenic mortality to be constant  age dependent  time dependent  or age and time dependent  Population estimates were made for each sex in all cases  We evaluated models fitted to data from each of 6 Oregon cougar management areas independently  We tested the models against simulated data to confirm the extent to which the models accurately capture trends in population size and structure Our results qualitatively match previous trends from the deterministic models  but the new model is more thoroughly tested and provides credible intervals on predictions  Cougar populations have increased in all management areas  sometimes dramatically  Harvest mortality was sex specific prior to 1994  but does not differ between the sexes since the use of hounds for hunting was outlawed in 1994  Our results should aid management decisions related to understanding cougar livestock conflicts and cougar ungulate relationships at regional scales  by predicting the population effects of future changes in policies or regulations related to cougar harvest       
Correcting mortality rates of asocial animals with prolonged periods of maternal dependence in demographic modeling Demographic modeling of population growth  such as that done with Leslie matrices  is a commonly employed tool in wildlife management and conservation that has been used to regulate harvest of bobcats  assess the recovery of gray wolves  and compare different strategies for the conservation of cheetahs  Although population modeling is inherently based on a number of simplyfying assumptions  e g   timing of reproduction and mortality  transitions between age classes  etc    some of these simplifications can result in substantial deviation from reality if not properly re evaluated in certain situations  For example  demographic models of asocial animals that exhibit a prolonged period of maternal dependence  e g   leopards  moose  and bears  often disregard the strong correlation between the survival of the mother and that of the young  In such populations where juvenile survival depends almost entirely on the survival of the mother  the death of a female would naturally lead to the death of any of her dependent young  Failure to account for this dynamic can lead to signficant overestimation of population growth  Here we propose an analytically derived correction factor that adjusts the apparent mortality of the juvenile age classes in matrix modeling to include deaths of maternally dependent individuals that result from mother mortality Failure to account for deaths of maternally dependent individuals resulting from mother mortality in matrix models resulted in a significant over estimation of population growth over a 20 year period in all theoretical modeled scenarios  p=0 86 0 98   Use of the correction factor significantly improved the accuracy of the matrix model in recreating population growth rates across a wide range of mortality and fecundity rates  numbers of age classes  and duration of maternal dependence  p=0 019 0 038   This analytically derived correction factor provides an easy and accurate way to implicitly account for this added mortality in Leslie matrices and other matrix models without having to resort to more complex individual fate models that can explicitly account for this dynamic  Because these models are often used to aid managers in setting harvest limits and regulations  overestimation of population growth can severely influence a population  s persistence and risk of extinction  We believe that the robustness and simplicity of this correction factor  combined with the risk of overestimating population growth in its absence  should encourage wildlife managers and biologists to incorporate it into employed matrix models and use it to fine tune population projections  evaluate the effects of harvest timing on population growth  and better inform current and proposed management strategies and regulations       
Historic changes in sediment loading and sediment sources in a large agricultural river system Rivers and streams in intensively row cropped  agricultural watersheds are often impaired by high sediment loads and turbidity  As expected  erosion from agricultural fields is a significant source of this sediment  However several recent studies have shown that erosion of non field  near channel sources such as streambanks and bluffs can be a larger contributor to the sediment impairments  Sediment cores from Lake Pepin  a natural impoundment on the Mississippi River  integrate the erosion history of a large agricultural watershed in the corn belt of the Midwestern USA  These cores show that not only have sediment loads increased by nearly 10 fold over the past 150 years  but that non field  near channel sources now contribute more than two thirds of the annual load  The increasing dominance of near channel erosion sources raises the question  have rivers in agricultural watersheds become more erosive  and if so why Fundamental to any increase in erosive power of rivers is an increase in flow  We quantified changes in flow  water yield  and runoff ratio for 21 rivers in agricultural watersheds of Minnesota over the period 1940 2009  Half of the rivers showed statistically significant increases of 50 100% in annual flow  Equally important  half of the rivers showed no changes in flow  despite being geographically nearby  Increased precipitation  crop conversions  and artificial drainage  including ditching  wetland drainage and sub surface tiling  all have the potential to increase river flow  and all three have coincident trends over the latter half of the 20 th century  To disentangle the role of each driver  we compared changes in climate  cropping patterns and drainage to changes in flow in each watershed  By calibrating annual flow to an annual water budget over the first 35 years of record  were we able to quantify the increase in flow in the more recent 35 years that could be attributed to each of the drivers  Changes in precipitation and crop conversion accounted for less than half of the increase in flow with the majority attributed to artificial drainage  Rivers with increased flow exhibited channel widening of 10 40%  with the amount of widening strongly correlated to the increase in annual flow  This widening of the stream channels is consistent with the observed increasing trend in non field  near channel erosion inputs to Lake Pepin and highlights land use change in general and artificial drainage specifically as contributors to turbidity impairments in these rivers       
Changing patterns in sediment delivery in incising agricultural watersheds Management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems in sediment impaired streams requires quantification of sediment sources  The focus here is on determining magnitude and sources of suspended sediment in a tributary of the turbidity impaired Minnesota River  USA  In the predominantly agricultural Le Sueur River  primary sources of fine grained sediment are classified as upland field vs  near channel sources  with near channel sources including stream banks  bluffs  and ravines  Our research group has been exploring the relative importance of near channel vs  upland sediment sources in both modern times and throughout the Holocene  The modern sediment budget was assembled from historic aerial photography  aerial lidar topographic data  repeat terrestrial lidar scans of bluffs  auto sampling of ravines  and geochemical fingerprinting of suspended sediment during storms  Erosional patterns in the Le Sueur are fundamentally controlled by events near the end of the last glaciation  The Minnesota River valley was carved through catastrophic drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz 13 4 ka BP  As the valley incised  knickpoints began migrating upstream on tributaries like the Le Sueur  carving deep valleys where most near channel sediment sources are derived  The history of incision is recorded in hundreds of strath terraces  cut into glacial till through channel migration and incision  Numerical modeling of valley evolution constrained by dated strath terraces was conducted to compare the modern sediment budget to that of the river prior to anthropogenic modification including widespread conversion of prairie and wetland to agricultural fields The modern sediment budget shows that most fine sediment in the Le Sueur River comes from bluffs  banks  and ravines in the deeply incised knick zone  Modern decadal scale near channel erosion rates are 3 5 times higher than   pre settlement   millennial scale erosion rates determined from numerical modeling  Depositional records from Lake Pepin downstream show a more dramatic 10 fold increase in deposition rates from pre settlement times to the present  Sediment fingerprinting shows that pre settlement sediment loads were dominated by near channel sediment sources  As deposition rates rose in the late 1800s and early 1900s  the sources included an increasing percent coming from fields  In the last few decades  deposition rates have remained high  but sediment loads are increasingly dominated by near channel sources once again  On going changes in basin hydrology  from both installation of agricultural drainage systems and on going climate change  have put more water in rivers  increasing rates of near channel erosion  This shift in sediment sources has significant implications for turbidity management to improve aquatic ecosystem health in the Minnesota River basin       
Long term trends in total suspended sediments from agricultural tributaries to Lake Erie	  Suspended sediment delivered to Lake Erie through riverine transport is a major concern  Sediment can not only carry other pollutants  such as phosphorus  but sedimentation in receiving harbors and shipping channels requires costly remediation and removal  The National Center for Water Quality Research has been monitoring total suspended sediments  TSS  and nutrients in the major US tributaries to Lake Erie for many years  The primary goal of this analysis was to examine the outcomes of efforts to reduce erosion from agricultural lands via trends in TSS from 1975 to 2012 in the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers  two agriculturally dominated watersheds in northwestern Ohio  Water samples were collected daily using automated samplers  ISCO  s  located at USGS gaging stations on the main stem of the rivers and at two smaller tributaries to the Sandusky River  Rock and Honey Creeks  TSS was measured as the dry mass of particles remaining on a pre weighed glass fiber filter after filtering a known volume of sample   Although discharge has been increasing in the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers over the past decade  TSS flow weighted mean concentrations  mg/L  and loads  metric tons  have been decreasing  linear regression  P  0 05  or have changed little  Both rivers exhibited positive linear relationships between ln transformed TSS concentrations and ln transformed discharge  When examined by year  the slopes of these linear relationships were not significantly different from 1975 2005  ANCOVA interaction  P  0 05   yet the intercepts have consistently declined  ANCOVA  P  0 05   This indicates a general decline in mean TSS over time  or more specifically that there was a lower TSS concentration for a given discharge in more recent years  The largest declines in TSS concentrations have been in the summer and fall compared to winter and spring  When comparing the tributaries to the Sandusky River with the mainstem  we found substantial effects of watershed size on TSS export  In Rock and Honey Creeks  a higher proportion of the annual TSS load was transported during storm events compared to the larger Sandusky River  Overall  these declines in TSS over the past 30 years suggest best management practices implemented throughout the watersheds to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss have been successful  Higher variability in storm transport of TSS in smaller watersheds may make it more difficult to detect positive results such as these  Future management should focus on sediment losses in the winter and spring to further reduce TSS export to downstream ecosystems       
Comparison of sediment in watersheds with varying amounts of conservation lands Increased suspended sediment commonly is associated with agricultural land use  Agricultural land retirement  Conservation Reserve  Conservation Reserve Enhancement  ReInvest in Minnesota  and other conservation programs  began in the 1990s with the goal of reducing sediment and nutrient transport to streams  The U S  Geological Survey  Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources  Hawk Creek Watershed Project  and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency have cooperated on monitoring studies of varying duration and drainage size to investigate the effects of conservation land on water quality in Minnesota River watersheds  A three year paired watershed study  including watersheds    15km^2  with and without conservation land along the riparian corridor  began in 2011 to assess sediment and nutrient concentrations in relation to contributions from agricultural fields and instream processes  bank sloughing  storage  or cycling   Samples of field and riparian soil  suspended sediment  and water were collected in 2011 and 2012  A second ongoing study focuses on the relation of sediment and nutrients to conservation land over time  This study includes data collected between 1998 and 2012 and identifies long term trends in sediment and nutrient abundance not evident in shorter duration studies  Results from the two ongoing studies and two completed studies will be reported  In a 2005 08 study of three paired watersheds  about 250 km^2  with varying degrees of conservation lands  Christensen and others  2009   the watershed with the most land retirement had the lowest suspended sediment concentrations  A 2001 03 study of 82 watersheds  from 4 to 2 190 km^2  Christensen and others  2012  indicated correlation between lower total suspended solids concentrations and greater conservation land area within 100 m  p=  03  to 400 m  p= 02  of a stream  This study indicated that when conservation lands are concentrated less than 100 m from a stream or more than 400 m of a stream  they may not be effective at reducing the amount of sediment reaching the stream       
Use of lake sediment accumulation to assess how conversion of cropland to grassland affects watershed scale erosion in the corn belt of Minnesota Conservation grasslands  or   set aside   lands  here comprise those lands enrolled in incentivized programs administered by federal and state agencies  such as the Conservation Reserve Program  CRP   These programs replace cultivated cropland with perennial vegetation  commonly grassland in our study region of southern and western Minnesota  thereby reducing field scale erosion  How do such field scale reductions in sediment and nutrient loads translate into watershed scale delivery to receiving waters  This study used sediment accumulation rates in 26 lakes in southern and western Minnesota as a measure of the delivery of eroded soil and phosphorus from watershed uplands to the lakes  Accumulation rates were calculated for the periods 1963 1986 and 1986 2007 to characterize sediment and phosphorus delivery before and after 1986  when many agricultural lands were enrolled in CRP Inorganic sediment accumulation rates decreased with increasing area of conservation grassland in the watershed  This linear relation explained only about 20% of the variance  leaving substantial unexplained scatter  The relation predicted that sediment accumulation would decrease by 3 4% for every 10% of cropland converted to grassland  Consideration of wetland sediment traps within the watershed did not measurably improve the relationship  nor did consideration of soil erodibility  slope length  and steepness factors  The decrease in sediment phosphorus accumulation rates as a function of increasing grassland area was not statistically significant at the p = 0 05 level  In the absence of substantial land cover change  inorganic sediment accumulation increased by about 20% and sediment phosphorus increased by about 35%  indicating that other factors were influential  These factors could include changes in annual rainfall  artificial drainage  in lake sediment transport processes  and lag effects in transport from uplands to lowlands       
Watershed sediment losses to lakes accelerating despite agricultural soil conservation efforts Agricultural soil loss and deposition in aquatic ecosystems is a problem that impairs water quality worldwide and is costly to agriculture and food supplies  In the US  for example  billions of dollars have subsidized soil and water conservation practices in agricultural landscapes over the past decades  We used paleolimnological methods to reconstruct trends in sedimentation related to human induced landscape change in 32 lakes in the intensively agricultural region of the Midwestern United States  Sediment cores were collected from each lake and dated using the radio isotope 210 Pb  Bulk sediment was divided into erosional and in lake produced sources based on the percentage loss on ignition  Concurrent changes to land use and agricultural practices were characterized based on agricultural census data and land cover maps for the past 150 years  Despite erosion control efforts  we found accelerating increases in sediment deposition from erosion  median erosion loss since 1800 has been 15 4 tons ha  1   Sediment deposition from erosion increased   6 fold  from 149 g m  2 yr  1 in 1850 to 986 g m  2 yr  1 by 2010  Average time to accumulate one mm of sediment decreased from 631 days before European settlement  ca  1850  to 59 days mm  1 at present  Up to 70% of the sediment deposited in lakes from this study was derived from erosional sources and most of this sediment was deposited in the last 50 years  In addition to increasing erosional inputs  in lake production  stimulated from nutrient enrichment  tripled since 1950  Increases in sedimentation were more strongly correlated to agricultural intensification post 1940 rather than initial land clearance or predominance of agricultural lands  Despite the presence of conservation practices in all watersheds in this study  traditional soil conservation programs have not decelerated downstream losses  Despite large erosion control subsidies  erosion and declining water quality continue  thus new approaches are needed to mitigate erosion and water degradation       
 Relationships between land use and sediment accumulation in 116 Minnesota lakes  from pre settlement to present 	  The native landscapes of Minnesota  USA have undergone enormous transformation since Euro American settlement in the mid 19th Century  Intensive logging has disturbed areas throughout the northern and eastern portions of the state while near total conversion of tallgrass prairie into farmland  combined with substantial wetland drainage  has created human dominated agroecosystems in the south and west  These occurrences and subsequent land use practices have unquestionably altered the quantity and timing of sediment fluxes from the terrestrial landscape to aquatic environments  but to what extent  Using paleolimnologic techniques  we explored the long term historical relationships between land use and terrigenous  siliciclastic  sediment accumulation in 116 lakes spanning 3 ecoregions and multiple land use regimes  including intensive row crop agriculture  Estimates were constructed using sediment core chronologies  based on 210 Pb  137 Cs  and loss on ignition data  % siliciclastic material  for the past 150 200 years  with corrections for sediment focusing  Because these lake sediment records provide an integrated signal of environmental change at the watershed scale  they may yield insights into the degree of aquatic impairment by excessive sedimentation and the effectiveness of conservation strategies in controlling sediment erosion   Siliciclastic sediment accumulation rates  SAR  for individual lakes span a wide range  from ~10 to   2000 g m  2 yr  1  across all time periods   Modern accumulation rates are greatest in lakes located within watersheds dominated by agricultural land uses  median 470 g m  2 yr  1   n=27  and lowest in northern forest lakes  median 77 g m  2 yr  1   n=54   Lakes in watersheds characterized by urban or mixed land uses in the central portion of the state show intermediate SAR  median 123 g m  2 yr  1   n=35   In all but 9 lakes  SAR has increased above natural background rates  pre settlement   Median SAR has approximately doubled in the northern forested lakes but has not begun to return toward pre settlement levels  perhaps due to legacy impacts from earlier logging  In the agricultural lakes  SAR has increased more than fivefold  Accumulation rates climbed sharply during initial land clearance and early farming  but increases after ~1940 appear to be somewhat diminished  Nevertheless  median SAR has not exhibited any overall decline  suggesting that benefits from improved land management and soil conservation practices in this region are  1  overstated  2  not yet observed in lake records due to considerable lag time  or 3  counterbalanced by increasing sediment fluxes from non field sources       
How are place based research communities created  Insights from two historical cases  Ecology  being interdisciplinary  has always experienced difficulty establishing its identity as a separate discipline  Creating field stations and fostering semi permanent research communities has been an important reason for the discipline  s growth and coherence  But why and how do research communities form  This problem can be approached historically by examining the complex motives underlying certain place based initiatives Important centers for place based research in ecology sometimes owed their existence to a fortuitous convergence of interests that were scientific  economic  and military  Two historical examples illustrate this point  the Carnegie Institution  s Desert Botanical Laboratory  1903 1940   which was one of the   hot spots   for ecological research in the U S  in the decade preceding the formation of the ESA  and the Arctic Research Laboratory created in the late 1940s at Point Barrow  Alaska  which was one of the first sponsored research activities of the Office of Naval Research  In recognizing the importance of intellectual communities as a force for the development of ecology  we might bear in mind the broader societal reasons for their creation  which may extend beyond the intellectual goals of advancing ecological science       
 Carving out a Place for Ecology  Long Term Ecological Studies in Glacier Bay  Alaska  Since John Muir  s first visit in 1879  Glacier Bay  Alaska  has had an unbroken history of scientific study  from 1879 forward its glaciers have been regularly mapped  and from 1916 its ecological patterns have been persistently studied  Given this long  continuous history of scientific study  Glacier Bay and the long term ecological study begun there by William Skinner Cooper in 1916 serve as an ideal case for the historical study of the interaction between place and ecological research  What initially drew ecologists to this region and what characteristics of the physical place and social space have continued to attract ecologists over the past century  Further  how have the physical place and social spaces of Glacier Bay shaped the scientific questions asked and scientific studies conducted there  In a 1923 publication  Cooper enumerated the   unique advantages of this region for exact successional study  the rapidity with which fresh areas are being laid bare  the consequent rapidity of vegetational development  and especially the known history of glacial behavior extending back a century and a quarter    Implicit within these scientific justifications was Cooper  s commitment to a particular type of ecological study    physiographic ecology    building on his education under Henry Cowles at the University of Chicago  While Glacier Bay certainly offered Cooper and succeeding generations of ecologists excellent conditions for studies of ecological succession  natural history alone does not account for the persistence of studies in this rather remote bay of Southeastern Alaska  The region  s aesthetic qualities and human history have also contributed greatly to the construction of this natural laboratory  While ecologists have actively shaped the scientific reputation of Glacier Bay  this place    both in its natural and social history    has also shaped ecological practice and theory over the past century  forcing ecologists to rethink both how to design their studies and also the power of their results to explain more universal phenomena       
Communities of early ecologists  The use of internet and archival resources to reconstruct ecologist communities at the founding of the Ecological Society of America The explosion of available digital records has dramatically affected the ease  efficiency  and breadth of research possibilities for ecologists interested in exploring historical questions  Members of the Historical Records Committee took on the challenge of seeing what we could discover about the ~307 ESA   Charter Members   by using Internet resources  supplemented in a few cases by easily accessible physical archival records  Initial results were presented at ESA in 2012  here we focus on the significance of a particular place  St  Louis  in interactions leading to individuals deciding to become members of the newly forming Society  Our starting point was information collected from charter members themselves in 1916 and published in the 1917 ESA Handbook   now available online  Additional internet resources included city directories  small town newspapers  census records  newsletters  meeting programs  archival finding aids  genealogical resources  and a wide variety of digitized scholarly publications and ephemera   Our attempts to clarify or expand initial information led to unexpected insights into early ecologist communities and ESA  For example  ESA charter member C  H  Turner  the first African American to receive a Ph D  from the University of Chicago   magna cum laude  1907   was a civil rights activist and internationally known behavioral entomologist high school teacher at the time ESA formed  His younger colleagues and friends Phil and Nellie Rau were husband and wife collaborators who had just completed four years of field work with very young twin boys in tow  resulting in the co authored publication Wasp Studies Afield  1918    Phil Rau's formal education had ended after fourth grade  and Nellie Rau's college degree was in library studies  The institution chiefly responsible for bringing these and other ecologists together was the St  Louis Academy of Science  where   elite amateurs   and professionals supported each other in research as well as activity in national scientific organizations  Notably  Turner  the African American high school teacher  had been a research mentor and friend to other St  Louis ecologists and active in other national societies  including as officer  before joining ESA  Each St  Louis charter member had professional connections beyond the city and state  and shared these contacts locally  Our examination of other charter members and a re analysis of basic membership parameters suggest the surprising diversity of backgrounds and connections of early ESA members in St  Louis was not atypical of other localities and thus any institutional history of ESA would benefit from inclusion of micro historical approaches  Our results depart in significant ways from the histories of Shelford and Burgess  for example  in part because of information and techniques not available to them       
Long term place based contributions to ecology  The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory  RMBL  was founded in 1928 in Gothic  Colorado  from the remains of an 1880s silver boomtown turned ghost town  From those humble beginnings  RMBL has evolved to become the country  s premier terrestrial field research station  filled to the capacity of 160 residents each summer with faculty  researchers  graduate students  postdocs  and undergraduates from across the country and overseas  Most of the research done there is work at the population level  and some of those populations have been studied for many decades  by researchers who have worked for much or all of their careers there  It is the home of a 50+ year study of marmot biology and behavior  now with its second PI   a 40+ year study of flowering phenology  and decades long work on aquatic insects  butterflies  ground squirrels  carrion beetles  etc  Many collaborations have been facilitated by the annual interactions among its researchers  What is it about RMBL that has generated the longevity and originality of so many studies  The scenic beauty  the relatively short well defined field  and growing  season  the sense of community  and the history of scientific research are contributing factors to the   sense of place   that encourages long term commitments to research at RMBL  A consequence of such a commitment is that the researchers often learn enough about the natural history of the area for that knowledge to serve as a source of new research ideas  creating even more incentive to continue the research commitment  The background information accumulated over years also provides a context for future work  and facilitates identification of unusual events that may be ecologically important  as well as a way to measure the consequences of climate change  The many opportunities that RMBL offers for research assistants and students have also helped to create new cohorts of researchers who return to RMBL as graduate students  postdocs  and PIs  At least two families have had consecutive generations of biologists work there  and several biologist couples work there now  This kind of long term commitment to research at a field site is of course not unique to RMBL  and similar examples can be found at other field stations around the world       
Ruth Patrick in the intellectual community at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia	  Ruth Myrtle Patrick was born in an era where women were encouraged to be educated on how to sew and cook  Patrick found other interests that she vigorously pursued  Patrick was born in November 1907 in Topeka  Kansas  more than a decade before her mother could cast a vote  Patrick  s interest in learning developed at an early age  she used the gift of a microscope that her father gave when she was 7 and never looked back  She graduated from Coker College in South Carolina and earned her PhD from the University of Virginia  Soon thereafter  Patrick joined the Academy of Natural Sciences and took charge in two endeavors  diatoms and stream pollution   In terms of basic research  Patrick  s work on diatoms was foundational and led to the creation of one of the largest diatom research collections  In her own trail blazing way  she was interested in studying these microorganisms but there were no collections at the time  This prompted her to start her own collection by taking preserved tadpoles from around the world and collecting diatom samples from the intestines  Patrick  s love of the microscopic organisms led to the work that may be most connected to her  water quality  Patrick would end up making numerous visits to South Carolina to study pollution in streams  She proposed the use of diatoms as indicator species for the health of streams and was soon conducting biological studies in the Conestoga Basin  Patrick paved the way for studies to utilize measures of biodiversity to assess stream health  particularly to monitor and mitigate anthropogenic pollution such as agricultural runoff and industrial discharge       
 Chicago as incubator for early 20 th century ecological ideas  networks  and collaborations  Founded by John D  Rockefeller in 1892  the University of Chicago was intended to be a modern and innovative center for research and education  Luring its high level faculty and administrators from other institutions  the University brought together personalities that were already primed for collaboration and innovation  The University is well known for training ecologists since its inception  one of its most famous students is Henry Chandler Cowles  HCC  who used the local Indiana Dunes as a laboratory for his research and pedagogical pursuits  and where he devised his ecological theory of succession  HCC had a huge effect on the development of ecology as a discipline  leaving a legacy of students who went on to play vital roles in the beginnings of ESA and The Nature Conservancy  What made the University of Chicago special  and how did it fit into the greater Chicago community The University was certainly not alone in facilitating ecological intellectual communities in the Chicago region  The Morton Arboretum  Chicago Academy of Sciences  and various clubs and organizations brought together professionals and enthusiasts under the banner of ecology and conservation  I will discuss how the unique vision for the University was one aspect that led to fruitful conditions for ecological ideas in Chicago       
 Numbers  values  and epistemologies  The evolution of cultural filters in the Ecological Society of America  The Ecological Society of America was founded in 1915   for the purpose of unifying the science of ecology  stimulating research in all aspects of the discipline  encouraging communication among ecologists  and promoting the responsible application of ecological data and principles to the solution of environmental problems    At that time  the biological basis for inheritance was unknown  the possibility of war and/or economic collapse on a global scale had not been imagined  and western forms of deity free religion  in the form of secular humanism  had not yet been articulated  In the USA  the legacy of manifest destiny was in full swing  and the idea that women might have something useful to contribute to public life was still a controversial idea  The thought that scientific societies might have legitimate reasons to influence public policy was  at best  a stretch  Throughout all this  ESA has remained remarkably consistent in its pursuit of its founding principles  even though the demographics of the society  the scope of acceptable research directions  and the range of acceptable styles of discourse have changed in substantial ways  This paper traces major threads in the evolution of cultural filters at ESA by examining characteristics of ESA activities over the years  including publications  sections/chapters  and the scope of annual meetings  The continued success of ESA in   promoting the responsible application of ecological data and principles to the solution of environmental problems   is due in part to the willingness of ESA leadership to adopt a flexible and adaptive stance relative to rapid changes in both sociocultural dynamics and scientific breakthroughs  This flexibility can be seen in the organizational history of the society  which reflects an ongoing evolution of cultural filters       
The value of ECOLOG L and how it has brought people from far and wide to one intellectual place	  ECOLOG L is an Internet discussion group for topics in ecology  supported by Listserv software  hosted by the University of Maryland  As such  it can function in some ways like a   place    similar to other places discussed in this session  Since its inception by David Inouye in 1992  it has grown to 17 000 subscribers  in what looks like a population growth curve still in the exponential growth phase  Many subscribers  but probably a minority  are members of the Ecological Society of America  Although subscribers come from about 60 countries  the US has the highest numbers  about 15 000  while many countries have only one or two subscribers  probably underestimated  data from interpreting e mail addresses   Like face to face social groups  some people tend to dominate a variety of discussions  while others are quiet  However  unlike social groups  there is a majority of silent observers  termed   lurkers   in listserv jargon  ECOLOG L serves its subscribers in a number of ways  Perhaps the most important function is as a place to post many kinds of job announcements  academic  federal  consulting  temporary field work  etc   or graduate student and postdoc positions available  and for job seekers and potential graduate students to ask for advice  Many ecologists ask for advice on lab or field techniques or on the best equipment to purchase for particular needs  Advice on statistical methods  ideas for the classroom  and opportunities for field courses are also common discussion topics  Requests also come in for publications that are hard to get in the country of the requestor  People are extremely helpful and generous with their suggestions  providing papers and other information  ECOLOG L is also a forum for intellectual discussions about theoretical questions in science  and also some heated disagreements about a number of topics  including political issues  the politics of academic publishing  women in science  the philosophy and science of alien species  and the reality  or not  of   sustainability    Trends in the nature of subject matter and impacts on subscribers will be discussed       
Ecological   camps    How preferences and professional traits shape our field	    Ecologists recognize and celebrate the discipline  s professional diversity  We can classify ourselves into subgroups through many dimensions such as domain of inquiry  method of investigation  competency in biological knowledge  environmental values and analytical skills  We also can be subdivided with respect to level of academic education and mode of employment  At least in principle  all of this diversity lends scientific power to the discipline  s ability to engage in the broad range of intellectual and practical challenges of ecology and environmental affairs  although the potential for conflict and incoherence must be recognized  We investigated how ecologists might be classified in terms of professional preferences for traits  We surveyed U S   non student members in April 2010 to assess their attitudes toward environmental involvement and scientific professionalism  Part of the survey scored preferences for 15 traits that might be associated with being a good ecologist  Traits ranged from aesthetics to ethics to professional competency  Principal components factor analysis with Varimax rotation produced 5 trait factors with Eigen values greater than 1  Factor scores were entered into a Hierarchical Cluster analysis  Ward  s method  and four distinct clusters emerged  Clusters were examined for differences across demographics  traits  and professional inclinations  The trait factors included  socially based environmentalism  3 items   nature aesthetics  3 items  professional skills  3 items   professional epistemology  3 items  and religious foundations for actions  1item   Respondent clusters were similar in their high ratings for professional skills and epistemology  Significant differences were seen in attitudes toward socially driven environmentalism  aesthetic appreciation of nature  and appreciation for religious foundations for action  The characteristics of different clusters have implications for different foci among ecologists  For example  one of the clusters is characterized as being relatively older  committed to caring for the environment for social reasons  and broadly represented across domains except for ecosystems  as well as not enjoying data analysis but enjoying teaching  and as providing moderate to high financial and civic support for environmental causes  This stands in contrast to a cluster of younger individuals including fewer women  and being  less committed to environmental concern for either social or aesthetic reasons  more concentrated in the organismal domain  least represented in the landscape aquatic domain  as well as doing less field observation but more modeling  Members of this group enjoy data analysis and writing but not teaching and are less involved and more dubious about engaging in environmental activities       
From complexity science to forest management Complexity science has been providing insights and guidance for a variety of disciplines  Ecosystems are a prime example of complex systems  but complexity science has received fairly little attention in ecology and even less in forestry  This talk provides an overview of recently initiated efforts to utilize principles from complexity science to guide forest management activities  These efforts cover a variety of strategies  including both top down  how would theories and relationships of complexity science exhibit themselves in application  and bottom up approaches  how do our current and modified management approaches relate to characteristics of complex systems  First  scientific reviews document in detail why and how ecosystems can be viewed as complex systems  These reviews specifically focus on how viewing forests through this new   lense   provides new insights  Examples show that the reputation of boreal forests as having low diversity is no longer valid when diversity is measured across a variety of hierarchical scales  Similarly  we are assessing how principles of complex systems  such as an emphasis on cross scale interactions  change how foresters view specific management practices  For example  costs and ecological implications of replanting efforts after small scale seedling mortality will vary with spatial and temporal scales used in the assessment  Third  research studies explore methods for quantifications of ecosystem adaptability  such as percent cover of species with specific functional and response type traits  This quantification allows evaluation of management practices in terms of their impacts on adaptive capacities of ecosystems  Fourth  we relate principles of current forest management approaches to characteristics of complex systems  This highlights which aspects of complex system theory are   easy   to account for using current management practices and which aspects require more research efforts to be useful for managers  Last  field labs and practices in classes and cooperation and discussion with landowners and foresters investigate how current management practices would be modified to account for theories from complexity science  These efforts include directed inventories that highlight the role of multiple scales and cross scale interactions  threshold and variables that influence thresholds  memory and legacies  and more  Students and foresters are then challenged to address all these aspects in their prescriptions       
Spatially explicit forest management planning  Putting theory into practice Forest ecosystems are facing novel conditions as the result of the synergistic interactions among natural disturbances  succession  fire  insect outbreaks  windthrow   anthropogenic direct activities  logging  land use change  and anthropogenic indirect activities  climate change   Ecological theory suggests that the spatial legacy past disturbances will affect the severity and extent of the subsequent disturbances in forested ecosystems  Ecological theory is difficult to extrapolate in the future given the long response times required to observe legacy effects in forested ecosystems and the stochasticity of large natural disturbances  Here we synthesize a body of research investigating interactions among logging patterns  fire disturbance  and spruce budworm outbreaks  A combination of published plot scale studies  dendrochronology  remote sensing  and spatial analysis  are used to  1  define spatial legacies and disturbance regimes  and  2  parameterize landscape disturbance and succession models to investigate long term interactions among logging  fire  and budworm disturbances  Empirical research was focused on a large landscape  Border Lake Landscape  BLL  where geopolitical boundaries have resulted in important land management legacies  managed forests in Minnesota  USA and in Ontario  Canada  and a large unmanaged wilderness   Simulation models were applied in parallel within the BLL and a comparable boreal mixedwood landscape in south central Quebec  Patch analyses of land cover data for the BLL demonstrates a strong spatial legacy of logging on the size distribution of forest openings that was further reinforced by interactions between the differential disturbance regimes and the forest recovery process  The spatial legacy created by logging was tempered by the prominence of natural openings     lakes and wetlands  in the BLL  and current spatial structure of forest composition was only weakly related to land management zones  Reconstruction of budworm outbreaks suggests that logging legacies do influence outbreak dynamics  frequency  duration  spatial synchrony   Simulations suggest though that forest age structure and composition  not spatial pattern  underlies budworm    logging disturbance interactions  The different disturbance types have different consequences for both spatial and compositional legacies  and these differential legacies in turn influence future natural disturbances  Further  the cumulative effects of multiple disturbance types degrade these legacies over time  Such interacting processes illustrate the challenges of incorporating ecological theory into landscape level planning  It is nonetheless clear that planning goals such as fire mitigation  ecosystem restoration  and sustainable forestry must account for the cumulative effects of interacting disturbances over long temporal and broad spatial scales within disturbance prone systems such as the boreal mixedwood of North America       
The perils of ignoring beta diversity when conducting applied research and developing management plans While beta diversity is a major topic of study among ecologists seeking to understand basic patterns and processes  this component of biodiversity is often ignored by applied researchers  conservation planners  and land managers  This disconnect is particularly pronounced in tropical forests  where beta diversity is exceptionally high but frequently overlooked in applied efforts  We explored the implications of this disconnect via two related initiatives  one focused on research into the effects of logging  and one focused on spatiotemporal forest management strategies  The first initiative investigated rates and consequences of pseudoreplication  a methodological flaw that confounds treatment effects with pre existing spatial variation     beta diversity   We reviewed all recent tropical logging effects studies to assess the incidence of pseudoreplication  and analyzed an original multi taxon dataset to explore the potential consequences of this flaw  For the second initiative  we developed and tested a novel conservation strategy for timber production forests that accounts for compositional variation among stands  This new approach assumes local harvest induced extinctions will occur and uses strategic spatiotemporal harvest planning to facilitate re colonization for as many species as possible Our literature review results indicate that the vast majority of tropical logging effects studies ignore beta diversity and implicitly assume logged areas were compositionally identical to unlogged areas prior to logging  Our empirical multi taxon analyses demonstrate that accounting for pre existing spatial variation dramatically reduces estimates of compositional changes resulting from logging  The results of our second initiative provide evidence that harvest plans informed by underlying compositional variation can improve biodiversity conservation in tropical production forest landscapes  Business as usual harvest plans are likely to synchronously disturb entire ranges of rare and/or clustered species  greatly increasing extinction risks  in contrast  strategic plans can minimize the number of species subjected to range wide harvest  Taken together  these two projects suggest that selectively logged tropical forests have more conservation potential than generally assumed  but that this potential is not being fully realized  In summary  our findings demonstrate that the failure to account for beta diversity can undermine applied initiatives ranging from field studies to conservation driven forest management efforts       
 The relationship between phylogenetic diversity  trait diversity  and temporal biomass dynamics in tropical successional forests  Ecological theory predicts that community species richness may affect ecosystem function in multiple ways  Managers often seek to restore diversity and function  although selection of species for restoration may prove challenging in diverse systems  Maximizing niche complementarity of tree species may be one way to increase carbon storage and promote species coexistence  Niche complementarity may be associated with axes of phylogenetic and functional diversity  PD and FD   with each axis potentially representing different forms of niche diversity  We studied how PD and FD of trees in 100m 2 quadrats in one year predicted temporal aboveground biomass  AGB  change over the subsequent year  Our study sites were eight 1 ha Costa Rican lowland rainforest plots in secondary and old growth stands  monitored annually for 15 years  PD and FD were calculated as the shared phylogeny or trait dendrogram branch length of co occurring species  We used linear mixed models to test for correlations between PD and FD and changes in AGB calculated by allometric scaling  We controlled for local stem density because stem density and diversity may be correlated due to sampling  We partitioned AGB change into growth gains  mortality losses  and net changes     change in total AGB   each having distinct implications for management In general  PD and FD effects on AGB dynamics differed with stand age  PD had a significant positive effect on growth AGB gains in young stands  10 23 yrs   but had no effect later in succession  FD of three traits  specific leaf area  SLA   leaf density  and wood specific gravity  were positively correlated with growth gains in AGB  while AGB gains were reduced with greater FD of leaf area and leaf toughness  High PD and FD for multiple traits were associated with lower AGB losses to mortality  but only in early successional stands  Overall  PD and wood specific gravity FD were positively related with net AGB change in early successional stands  while FD of nearly all leaf traits was negatively correlated with net AGB change in mid successional  24 39 yrs  stands  Our findings indicate that managing PD and wood specific gravity FD may accelerate the recovery of AGB in restoration efforts via increased growth and lower mortality in diverse stands       
Ecology meets practice  The case of uneven aged silviculture and 'emulation' of gap phase dynamics Uneven aged or selection silviculture  SS  is the predominant forest management practice in Northern hardwood forests of eastern North America  and is increasingly practiced in other forest systems from the boreal to the tropics  SS is of particular ecological interest in that it is designed to   emulate   gap phase dynamics as occurs in unmanaged forests  I outline salient details of SS as practiced in the Canadian province of Ontario  the jurisdiction with the largest area of forest is managed under SS  and examine how ecological theory has informed these practices  I also present novel data comparing unmanaged    old growth    forests to SS forests at Haliburton Forest in Central Ontario  with a specific focus on   1  tree species composition   2  stem size and age distributions   3  gap dimensions   4  leaf area index   5  understory light conditions  and  6  stand level carbon flux Empirical data are consistent with prior studies in finding that SS management results in pronounced shifts in tree species composition  favoring certain shade tolerant trees and reducing mid tolerant species and overall tree species diversity  Stem size distributions in SS stands show a reduced abundance of large old trees compared to unmanaged stands that largely account for reduced basal area and volume in SS stands  Gap dimensions in SS stands are similar to those in unmanaged stands  but on average leaf area index is higher  and understory light levels lower in SS stands than in unmanaged stands  Carbon flux data based on eddy covariance measurements over 4 years indicate a greater C sink in most years in an SS stand compared to a comparable unmanaged stand in northern Wisconsin  but in one exceptional year the SS stand was a large C source  The case is made that in general there has been very little input of ecological theory on evolving forestry practice related to SS  and conversely that SS provides a set of important patterns and problems that remain largely unaddressed by theory  For ecological theory to have greater relevance  ecologists must understand both the details of management practices to find   windows of opportunity   that make applications possible  as well as the policy framework s  within which management regulations and guidelines can be implemented       
Applying conservation decision tools to forests  Fire management in the Sierra Nevada Changing climates are forcing forest resource managers to rethink historical objectives for managing reserves in pristine states and restoring historical disturbance regimes  If looking to the past is no longer a guide for future forest management  then what are the potential guideposts to plan and evaluate success of public lands management  We initiated an consortium approach to research  assembling a team of researchers and managers from the National Park Service  US Forest Service  US Geological Survey and the University of California  to assess the vulnerability of Southern Sierra Nevada forests to climate change and fire  Our research questions were  what forest types are most vulnerable to climate  and fire driven change  when do these types become vulnerable  and where do they become vulnerable first  Conversely  we asked what  and where do we find  forests least vulnerable to change  We used a simple bioclimatic envelope approach using a hydroclimatic downscale model for two future climate scenarios to assess vulnerability  but not predict future distribution  We then applied a simple fire simulation model to a small portion of the landscape to test for how well different approaches to fire management result in minimizing the risk of land cover conversion through high intensity fire We find that iconic resources such as the giant sequoia  lower slope oak woodlands  and high elevation conifer forests are projected as highly vulnerable by models that project a warmer drier future  but not as much by models that project a warmer future that is not drier than current conditions  Further  we find strongly divergent vulnerabilities of these forest types across land ownership  National Parks versus US Forest Service lands   Examining potential magnitude of future change suggests that the region is likely to be characterized by strong upslope shifting of open grassland  chaparral and hardwood types  A simple fire simulation evaluated four fire management strategies  business as usual  resist change  foster orderly change  protect vital resources  across four different scenarios of future climate and fire frequency  None of these strategies was uniformly successful in protecting critical resources across the range of future conditions examined  This failure to protect valued resources is driven by current management constraints on the amount of management available to resource managers  The result is likely to be continued increases in the observed frequency of large landscape changing fire in the region       
Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy Ecologists have long recognized that forest succession in former agricultural lands proceeds by a process of   nucleation    whereby pioneer shrubs and trees establish patchily and spread through growth and facilitation of the dispersal and establishment of other species  Nonetheless  most forest restoration efforts plant large areas with trees in a homogeneous manner  We established a large scale study between 2004 and 2006 with 13  ~1 ha experimental sites spread across 100 km 2 in southern Costa Rica to test the applied nucleation approach to facilitating succession  The three restoration treatments at each site include planting four species of trees throughout  plantation   planting the same tree species in different sized nuclei  4  times  4  8  times  8  12  times  12 m  nucleation treatment   and no tree planting  control   Sites are surrounded by 9 89% forest cover within a 500 m radius  in order to be able to test interactions between the effect of restoration strategy and the landscape context  Over the past eight years we have monitored numerous changes in these experimental plots  including planted tree growth  seed rain and tree recruitment  overall vegetation composition  small scale heterogeneity in soil nutrients and light availability  bird and bat communities and behavior  and a number of other variables Our results provide several important insights into the applied nucleation restoration strategy  First  both the diversity and abundance of seed rain and tree recruits in the first few years of succession are similar in plantation and nucleation treatments  and are much lower in controls  Second  canopy openness  the primary variable that is correlated with tree seedling recruitment  is more heterogeneous in the nucleation than the plantation treatment  whereas heterogeneity of most soil nutrients was similar across treatments  Third  there seems to be a critical tree nucleus size  ~100 m 2 in our system  below which tree nuclei do not serve to enhance seed rain or seedling establishment  Fourth  planted tree nuclei are expanding rapidly  primarily due to growth of planted trees  but also due to recruitment around the edge of nuclei  Fifth  bird communities are most similar to reference forests in plantation plots surrounded by high forest cover  demonstrating an interaction between restoration strategy and landscape context  Results on the early stages of succession suggest that applied nucleation is a promising and cost effective restoration strategy that should be used more widely  but longer term data are needed to compare the rate and direction of the successional trajectories of the different restoration strategies       
Can a general theory of forest structure and dynamics based on metabolic scaling laws provide insights to forest managers  The metabolic theory of ecology  MTE  integrates allometric and biomechanical principles to explain emergent properties of plant communities  Extensions of MTE to forests have shown how tree level allometric relations scale up to predict forest wide attributes such as tree size distributions and mortality rates  The power of the MTE is that these scaling relationships are thought to be general rules that hold for all forests  The essential underpinning of the MTE  namely the strong expression of allometric scaling in trees  has long been a core aspect of forest management  For example  empirically derived relationships between tree density  growth  and mortality inform the   thinning rules   that foresters apply to achieve site specific management objectives  At the same time  the criticisms regarding the applicability of predictions based on the MTE are also mirrored in the forestry literature  For example  MTE assumes the competition for space is the dominant process governing stand dynamics  No account is made for the size asymmetric competition for light nor is there a place for density independent causes of mortality  Similar debates have occurred in forestry regarding the generality of the   3/2 power   thinning law  However the potential value of general expectations based on the fundamental physiology and architecture of trees should not be dismissed lightly  In era of unprecedented and unpredictable changes in the environment  the validity of guidelines based on past measurements is diminished  Therefore we explore the potential of MTE predictions to inform management using long term data from two temperate forests  Specifically we ask if can use deviations from the expected MTE behavior to provide an early warning of novel events that may threaten management goals  In both examples  we calculated the annual mortality rate as a function of stem diameter for periods that spanned the emergence of forest decline  In one case  the decline was due to the arrival of an invasive pathogen in a California conifer forest  in the other the decline was related to a suite of stressor that impacted a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire  In our preliminary analysis  we see a marked increase in the mortality rate      above the MTE prediction  in the mid sized trees with the deviations more apparent in the northern hardwood stand  These deviations are reflected in the size distribution exponent  We propose an approach that relies on the more easily measured variable  size distribution  as a means for managers to detect the initial stages of forest decline       
Invoking life history theory to understand species' responses to human disturbance Trade offs between energetically costly activities are well established in life history theory  A trade off between survival and reproduction has been documented in natural populations across several taxonomic groups  yet little is known about how human disturbance might influence this trade off  Human disturbance confers multiple threats to wildlife populations  including altered food abundance and changes in actual or perceived predation risk  that may influence the cost of reproduction on survival  potentially altering this trade off from that expected where human disturbance is minimal  Across 24 bird species and 84 locations in the northeastern United States with varying levels of human disturbance  as measured by housing density   we tested for evidence of a trade off between survival and reproduction  We then determined if the direction of the relationship differed between less disturbed and more disturbed locations  locations with   50 versus   100 housing units/square kilometer   We addressed our question using both phylogenetic regression and mixed effects models to account for species relatedness and repeated measures  and included body metrics in our analysis to control for effects of body size We observed a trade off between survival and reproduction when performing our analysis across all locations and in less disturbed locations  but this trade off no longer occurred in more disturbed locations  Where a trade off was present  the negative relationship between survival and reproduction across species was more strongly supported when body metrics were included in models  the relationship between survival and reproduction became more negative  and there was a positive relationship between body size and survival  This relationship was robust across both phylogenetic regressions in which species   data were aggregated as an average across locations  and mixed effects models in which all locations were included in the analysis  The lack of a trade off between survival and reproduction across species in more disturbed locations likely reflects a highly variable and non uniform response to human disturbance across species  Investigating this trade off across other taxa may aid in determining species   vulnerabilities  and serve in testing application of concepts in life history theory to human disturbed regions       
Needed modifications to the hundred year old silvicultural treatments  managing for diverse and resilient forests	  The presently available silvicultural tools have been highly effective in achieving the results asked of silviculturists  Until only a few decades ago  forest management goals were primarily sustainable production of timber  More recently  they also included improvement of habitat for game species  rare and endangered species  and soil and watershed protection  among others  However  the dominant practices require some modifications for a number of reasons  1  they do not necessarily provide suitable conditions for many of the diverse organisms that are part of the forest ecosystem  2  forest resilience needs to be improved due to the rapidly changing climate conditions whose impacts on forest ecosystems are largely unknown  3  forests worldwide have to continue to provide more products and services and to more people in the absence of net increase in forested area  Theoretical work and results from the few research projects testing modifications to silvicultural treatments suggest to  1  increase species diversity  Examples of methods to achieve this include retaining rare species and controlling their competitors  extending the retention period for some trees to allow natural regeneration  leaving enough individuals to allow cross pollination to maintain genetic diversity  planting rare species with consideration of their natural spatial pattern of distribution  2  increase diversity of structures  Findings from studies recommend variable retention harvesting to retain dense and sparse patches  large and small trees  standing dead trees  trees with cavities  down woody debris  understory species  3  extend rotation length  at the very least by leaving some remnants  4  accelerate development of desired attributes  Specific suggestions are production of old growth characteristics by increasing growth rates of selected trees  creating snags  producing down woody debris  scarring to provide entry point for decay to create decadent trees and cavities  and production of seeds of key tree species sooner by controlling their competition  5  incorporate risk and uncertainty into the choice of silvicultural treatments and their implementation  A remaining major obstacle for implementation is that most modifications would cost the landowner       
A conceptual framework for understanding multi scaled cause effect relationships between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems In order to make broad scale inferences about terrestrial aquatic linkages  ecological studies should span and integrate across multiple spatial and temporal scales  However  because ecological conditions have not been continuously and consistently monitored across broad scales  broad scale knowledge is often developed by extrapolating from fine scale studies  This extrapolation is often misleading because  a  processes at one spatial or temporal scale interact with processes at another scale      cross scale interactions  CSIs   leading to non intuitive relationships  and  b  we do not adequately understand broad scale      regional  controls of ecosystem processes  Our objective is to present a framework and approach for studying multi scaled relationships  including different types of CSIs  that addresses challenges in quantifying multi scale cause effect relationships between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems  We compiled nutrient and organic carbon data from 2 000 lakes in the Midwest and Northeast U S  We quantified aquatic and terrestrial drivers at two important spatial extents  the local and the regional  We modeled the effects of regional and local predictor variables on lake nutrients and organic carbon to assess the importance of CSIs in modeling these relationships across a broad spatial extent We found CSIs were important for understanding broad scale variation in lake nutrients and organic carbon  For example  the effect of local wetland extent on lake total phosphorus concentrations  TP  differed across regions and was explained by a CSI in which local wetland effects on TP was related to the regional agriculture cover  For lakes in high agriculture regions  the presence of local wetlands was negatively related to TP  whereas the relationship was reversed in low agriculture regions  In contrast  although the effects of local wetlands on total nitrogen concentrations differed across regions  we did not detect any CSIs  Finally  the effect of local wetlands on organic carbon  OC  differed across regions and a CSI existed in which the effect of local wetlands on OC was related to regional groundwater flow  For lakes in regions of high groundwater flow  we found no effect of local wetlands on OC  whereas in regions of low groundwater flow  there were positive effects of local wetlands on OC  Our results show that scientists must consider multiple spatial extents and CSIs that are specific to response variables in order to better understand variation in terrestrial aquatic linkages       
Terrestrial aquatic linkages in Prairie Pothole lakes in alternative stable states Lakes represent less than 1% of the aquatic surface area of the Earth  yet are extremely important to carbon processing owing to their close proximity to terrestrial ecosystems and high rates of productivity  Global estimates indicate that nearly 3 Pg of terrestrial carbon are processed by freshwater aquatic systems annually  mostly in highly productive wetlands  oxbows  shallow lakes and rivers where about half of organic carbon coming into these freshwater systems is released into the atmosphere as CO2  one fifth is buried in the sediments and the rest is transported downstream  eventually to the oceans  But local estimates of these fluxes are quite variable owing to differences in hydrology  climate and productivity We have been examining the carbon inputs and outputs to shallow lakes in western Minnesota that bury and transform large quantities of the terrestrial organic carbon that comes into them  Importantly in these lakes  the variability of internal carbon processing is affected by biotic structure and human management of the lakes and surrounding landscapes  In lakes dominated by macrophytes  the organic matter degraded slower and facilitated anoxic and hypoxic conditions particularly under the ice  yet burial rates of organic carbon were similar to lakes where phytoplankton were the dominant plants  Burial rates were high and varied from 56 96 g/m2/yr on average  The biggest difference between the carbon budgets in the two lake types was in dissolved organic matter degradation  DOM  rates with DOM in macrophyte dominated systems turning over 3 times slower than in phytoplankton dominated systems  These results suggest that macrophyte dominated lakes may be an important source of recalcitrant DOM into the regional groundwater       
Terrestrial support of pelagic consumers in lakes  Results of a multi lake study	    Lake food webs can be supported by primary production from within the lake  organic matter imported from the watershed  or some mixture of these two sources  Current debates about food web subsidies to lake ecosystems often depend on data from only a few ecosystems  and therefore do not consider the potential variability of subsidies among diverse ecosystems on a landscape  The goal of this work is to quantitatively account for the variation among lake ecosystems in terrestrial  allochthonous  utilization by pelagic consumers  We conducted a 40 lake hydrogen and carbon stable isotope survey  sampling Chaoborus spp  and other zooplankton taxa in order to quantify consumer allochthony and to develop a model that predicts the variation in allochthonous resource use based on availability   Consumer allochthony varied between 4 and 82%  mean=36%  for Chaoborus spp  and between 1 and 76% for other zooplankton consumers  Our results demonstrate that both the range in consumer allochthony among systems and the degree of allochthonous support within systems is substantial  The degree of allochthonous resource use increased exponentially  r 2 =0 44  p value  0 01  with the proportion of allochthonous resources available     consumers in the most allochthonous rich lakes use the larges fraction of allochthonous resources   Additionally  lake surface area was inversely correlated consumer allochthony  r 2 = 0 49  indicating that allochthonous subsidies are more important in smaller  rather than larger systems  Given these results  it is clear that allochthonous subsidies are important in a large number of lake ecosystems       
Weather and land use mediate the C N P stoichiometry of watershed exports Many areas  including the Midwestern US region  are experiencing an increased frequency of large storm events  Our goal was to determine how increased pulse flow affects the carbon   nitrogen   phosphorus  C N P  stoichiometry of watershed exports  Variation in C N P exports is important because it can influence downstream aquatic nutrient limitation  nutrient and carbon sequestration  and biodiversity  We quantified exports using a high frequency  flow dependent sampling regime for two water years in two Ohio watersheds of contrasting land use  agricultural  three streams  forested  one stream  to get daily exports of C  N  and P in dissolved organic and inorganic  DOC  DON  DOP  ammonium  nitrate  SRP  and particulate  PC  PN  PP  fractions  We then used hydrograph separation techniques to obtain daily base flow and pulse flow exports for each C N P fraction  We calculated a pulse  to base flow ratio  P B  during high flow events for C N P export ratios  DIN SRP  DOC DON DOP  PC PN PP  to see how increased pulse flow affects these ratios in watersheds of contrasting land use  We also regressed P B  s for individual discrete events against average discharge during each event  P B ratios for DIN SRP were    1 in both watersheds suggesting that pulse flow elevates SRP over DIN  In general  P B ratios for DOC DON and DOC DOP were    1 for both watersheds and DON DOP were    1 for both watersheds  Increased DOC relative to DON and DOP during pulse flow could negatively impact microbial communities in downstream waters  P B ratios for PC PN PP in the forested watershed were near or    1 while they were    1 in the agricultural watershed likely a consequence of differential exports of mineral sediments  Overall  regressions for P B against average storm discharge explained more variation when considering events within a season      fall  winter  summer  and spring  than when combining all seasons together  We also typically found that within specific C N P stoichiometric ratios  discharge correlated with P B  s in the same direction for both watersheds  exceptions were found with PC PP  PN PP  and TC TN  Taken together  our results suggest that increased pulse flow due to more frequent storm events will have complex effects on C N P stoichiometry of watershed exports  Further  results suggest a flow land use interaction for many ratios      the extent to which C N P ratios increase or decrease with increased pulse flow depends on land use       
Human and natural controls over ecosystem nitrogen retention in lakes Human driven increases in concentrations of reactive nitrogen  N  strongly impact biodiversity  biogeochemical processes  and water quality in earth  s ecosystems  The sources leading to excess N are well known  but the removal processes that reduce negative effects of excess N are poorly understood  For example  lakes have been shown to be strong sinks for watershed N via benthic denitrification  and may substantially reduce N transport to downstream rivers and coastal zones  yet some lakes show rising levels of nitrate  I used a synthesis of annual whole ecosystem mass balance measurements to explore the factors that regulate N retention in lakes  To interpret variation in N retention  I analyzed data for physical and biological factors known to affect N cycling and transport in coupled lake watershed systems  focusing on factors that often co occur with increased N loading to lakes Total N removal rates in lakes increased with N loading  exhibiting little decrease in removal under the highest N loading rates  N removal efficiency  the proportion of external N load removed annually  was primarily influenced by lake hydrology and not N loading rate  N removal and N removal efficiency were enhanced by the availability of phosphorus  P   Phosphorus availability increased annual rates of N removal  via positive effects on lake productivity  which stimulate N uptake in the water column as well as sedimentary denitrification and burial  Human activities and natural processes that increase P availability stimulate N removal thereby reducing N transfer to downstream ecosystems  Conversely  reductions in lake productivity due to P control measures appear to promote accumulation of N  especially in large lakes  Because lake productivity levels are strongly affected by human activities  management of increasingly N saturated landscapes must consider multi element interactions to predict future changes in N concentration and flux through watersheds       
 Flood and drought enhanced variations in streamwater nitrate flux in an agricultural watershed  Clear Creek  Iowa  Nitrogen  N  fertilization is a cornerstone of modern agriculture  but the practice also leads to eutrophication  hypoxia  and harmful algal blooms in both inland and coastal waters  Several studies identify Iowa  Illinois and Indiana as major source areas of N discharged by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico where large scale hypoxia develops annually  Continental scale management of nitrogen requires a comprehensive understanding of watershed specific hydrologic dynamics and their consequences for nitrate flushing from agricultural landscapes  Spatiotemporal variation in nitrate fluxes is inherently complex due to the broad range of physicochemical and hydraulic properties that influence N movement through soils  groundwater  and rivers  Amplification of drought cycles due to climate change will introduce increased variability on stream flow and nutrient delivery to sensitive downstream ecosystems  However  the influence of pronounced wet/dry cycles on N export from agricultural landscapes is poorly understood  To address this need  we monitored nitrate flux with high temporal resolution from an agricultural watershed in Iowa  Clear Creek   Our objective was to quantify differences in storm related nitrate fluxes in two years with contrasting antecedent moisture conditions  Specifically  we contrast the wet conditions of 2009  following the 500 year flood of 2008  to the 2012 drought conditions  Temporal nitrate concentrations show distinct short term differences in response to storm events  with a net decrease in concentration  dilution  observed following storm events in 2009  wet year   and increases in concentration observed in 2012  dry year   While the magnitude of event driven nitrate fluxes is highly variable  the annual baseflow flux in 2009 was an order of magnitude greater than observed in 2012  Analysis of nitrate flux vs  stream discharge further distinguishes the differing flow regimes and the impact on resulting nitrate export  While contrasts in this relationship have previously been observed by comparing different watersheds  we show that differences in nitrate flux flow relationships also occur within the same watershed under differing antecedent moisture conditions  The results of this study show the extreme variations in nitrate flux associated with pronounced wet/dry cycles  and the rapid shift in hydrologic connectivity within three years  Continuing analysis aims to identify thresholds across which agricultural streams  such as Clear Creek  switch from periods when rain induced runoff increases stream nitrate concentrations to periods when nitrate concentrations are diluted  Information connecting storm events  antecedent environmental conditions and nutrient dynamics is critical for improving our predictions of nitrate loading to riverine networks under increased climatic variation       
Contribution of methane and lateral carbon fluxes in a temperate marsh carbon budget Lateral transport of dissolved organic carbon  DOC  and particulate organic carbon  POC  can account for a significant portion of the carbon budget in coastal wetlands  The allochthonous carbon imported from adjacent terrestrial ecosystems might be released as CO 2 or CH 4 or deposited in sediments in these systems  We examined the relevance of CH 4 emission and lateral hydrological carbon fluxes in context of ecosystem C budget in a 129 ha managed marsh wetland located in the Winous Point along the Lake Erie shoreline from March 2011 to March 2013  CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes were measured using an eddy covariance tower  The DOC and POC fluxes were measured at the three inlets from adjacent croplands/woodlands and one outlet to the lake  Carbon sedimentation was obtained by the feldspar marker method   The climate was warmer and dryer in 2012 than 2011  The water level in the marsh was maintained 0 1~0 7 m above ground by controlling the outflow gate  Gross ecosystem productions  GEP  were estimated 553 and 491gC m  2 yr  1 in 2011 and 2012  respectively  Ecosystem respirations  ER  were 527 and 490 gC m  2 yr  1 in 2011 and 2012  corresponding to 95% and 100% of the GEP  CH 4 emission showed a clear seasonality with high value of ~600 mg m  2 day  1 on hot summer days  Overall  the CH 4 fluxes can be reasonably modeled by the surface water temperature  R 2 = 0 86 0 88   The annual CH 4 emissions were 47 and 63gC m  2 yr  1 in 2011 and 2012  8% and 13% of the GEP   respectively  which is higher than the average  24 plusmn 6 gC m  2 yr  1   for North American wetlands  The lateral DOC/POC transports showed a typical flow in/flow out regime in 2011  The three inlets imported 80/8 gC m  2 yr  1 DOC/POC  while the outlet exported 36/4 gC m  2 yr  1   In contrast  the outlet was less frequently opened in 2012 in order to maintain inundated conditions in the marsh  During the dry late summer and fall  the water flow reversed in the inlets and exported significant amount of DOC/POC back to the upstream farm ditches  The annual DOC/POC imports from the inlets reduced to 11/ 3 gC m  2 yr  1   The DOC/POC outflows reduced to 7/2 gC m  2 yr  1   Clearly  the lateral transports and CH 4 emissions account for significant portion  2 16% and 8 13% of annual GEP  in the marsh carbon budget  Hydrological management  by maintaining flooding and controlling the inflow/outflow regime  has considerable influence on wetland carbon cycles       
Inorganic nitrogen cycling in ephemeral urban waterways of the semi arid Southwest Elevated loading of non point source inorganic nitrogen  N  in urban runoff is a major water quality concern in water and N limited regions such as the semi arid Southwestern US  Although ephemeral streams in drylands have long been recognized as biogeochemical hotspots  it is unclear how inorganic N cycling varies across ephemeral urban streams of distinct substrates in response to episodic wetting  Therefore  we performed stream channel wetting experiments using an isotopic label   15 N as K 15 NO 3   to identify N processing pathway differences in 3 ephemeral urban streams of distinct substrates  % soil C and % soil N in Tucson  AZ  1  sand  2  sandy loam and 3  loam  We applied the 15 N label at a rate of 1 3 kg ha  1   and wetted the experimental plots to 25% volumetric water content  We monitored CO 2   and N 2 O gas fluxes for 6 hours and changes in soil inorganic and microbial N before and after the experiment Fluxes of CO 2 were significantly   alpha  = 0 05  lower in the sand  1 05  plusmn  0 21 SD g CO 2  C m  2 hr  1   than in the sandy loam and loam streams  1 77  plusmn  0 75 and 1 86  plusmn  0 87 g CO 2  C m  2 hr  1   respectively   while sand and sandy loam stream N 2 O fluxes  6 91  plusmn  5 06 and 8 42  plusmn  7 17 mg N 2 O N m  2 hr  1   respectively  were significantly higher than loam N 2 O fluxes  3 03  plusmn  2 49 mg N 2 O N m  2 hr  1    Approximately 21 4 %  13 9% and 2 3% of cumulative N 2 O flux in the sand  sandy loam and loam streams  respectively  was 15 N 2 O  suggesting a greater fraction of NO 3  N loss to denitrification in the coarser streams  We observed significant 15 N enrichment of soil NH 4 from pre experiment and control plot values of  4 7  plusmn  11 8 permil  and  7 2  plusmn  11 8 permil   respectively  to labeled plot values of 110 7  plusmn  63 0 permil   indicating potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium  DNRA  activity in these ephemeral streams  We show that N cycling in coarser substrates is limited by water  N transport and labile carbon  and by N transport and microbial N uptake in fine substrates  We suggest that through modification and management  urban ephemeral streams can mitigate non point N loading to surface waters in semi arid climates       
Integrating the effects of nutrient and DOC loading on lakes over millennial timescales One of the enduring themes in paleolimnology is the long term trophic development of lakes    as a consequence of natural or anthropogenic changes in material export from the terrestrial catchment  While we  ve become reasonably proficient in using lake sediment records to reconstruct material fluxes  nutrients  major ions  sediment  associated with human disturbance  progress on the effects of natural forcing  climate  fire  vegetation and soil development  is more limited largely because of the comparative subtlety of the signals and the complexity of the catchment processes involved  And trophic reconstruction itself has been a particularly elusive grail  owing to the fact that we have no reliable proxy for total ecosystem productivity and because heterotrophic and autotrophic production cannot at present be de convolved in the sediment record This presentation will review concepts of lake productivity from a paleo  and neo limnological perspective along with efforts to reconstruct trophic change and its linkages to the transfer of both organic carbon and nutrients from the terrestrial system  Nutrient export  particularly that associated with human activities  has received the greatest attention in paleolimnological studies  owing to its obvious effects on autotrophic productivity  However  organic carbon subsidies  which reflect long term catchment vegetation succession and soil process  have equally profound effects on biological structure and trophic interactions in aquatic systems  This talk will thus consider the contrasting trajectories and drivers of heterotrophic and autotrophic production in the context of postglacial landscape development  land use disturbance  and climate change       
Trajectories of long term ecological change in shallow lakes  allochthonous drivers and autochthonous stability Shallow lakes can be subject to two ecological extremes  a clear water  macrophyte dominated or turbid  algal dominated state  The drivers of ecological instability that promote the success of these end member states can overlap and interact making management of these ecosystems frustrating  Direct links between landscape processes and ecological state remain elusive  The main focus of the majority of research has been on contemporary  short term autochthonous processes  We pose the question  Are the long term ecological trajectories an effective means of describing the underlying mechanisms of ecological stability in shallow lakes  To address this question we couple contemporary and paleo limnological methods from a number of shallow lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region  PPR  of North America  We selected lakes which currently exist in either a turbid or clear state  The PPR is rich in shallow lakes and wetlands and the landscape has been almost exclusively converted to agriculture  which is often associated with a dramatic change in allochthonous inputs   Our research has highlighted that significant differences exist between states in short term autochthonous processes  e g  turnover rate of DOM   however these processes do not translate into strong differences in the net ecosystem production between states  Over decadal timescales we find that the variability of OC burial does not correspond to ecological state  We find a number of allochthonous inputs and drivers influence each lake over variable timescales  but the overall long term ecological stability of the lake is controlled largely by trophic interactions  In this talk we present long term case studies that highlight allochthonous drivers   such as phosphorus inputs  hydrologic alteration  and clastic detrital inputs from the watershed    and the in lake response  We show that the ecological stability of a clear water state can be controlled by food web stability     lack of planktivorous and benthivorous fish   the physical setting of the lake  and nutrient inputs  Our work highlights the importance of both allochthonous inputs and in lake processes in promoting long term stable  clear water shallow lakes       
The role of animals in stabilizing ecosystem process under changing climate regimes Changes in climate often present ecosystems with unique challenges  ranging from non perceptible  such as adjustments in metabolic rates  to profound  such as migrants arriving significantly earlier in the spring than normally anticipated  Both the non perceptible and profound can affect ecosystem processes  altering net rates of primary production through direct and indirect changes in community structure and function  These complicated relationships are more easily interpreted through research conducted at LTER sites  where long term data on biotic and abiotic conditions is available  Our work at the Hubbard Brook LTER led us to investigate these complex relationships in light of changing winter conditions and altered snow pack regimes  We specifically investigated how snow depth and soil freezing will influence activity of large herbivores and soil invertebrates  and how this activity feeds back to decomposition and nutrient dynamics  We have used short term experimentally manipulated plots  a natural climate gradient and long term weather data at Hubbard Brook to evaluate how changes in winter climate will influence ecosystem processes in this northern hardwood forest   Experimental removal of snow to induce soil freezing and observations along a natural frost gradient at Hubbard Brook  coupled with animal activity produced surprising results  First  changes in snow depth led to altered browsing behavior in moose  where balsam fir was more heavily browsed under low snow conditions compared to sugar maple or viburnum shrubs  Second  plants that were mechanically browsed to simulate moose feeding triggered differential plant response and nutrient uptake  where moose fecal nitrogen was more available to balsam fir than sugar maple or viburnum shrubs  while biomass production was reduced  Decomposition rates were also slowed or reduced under soil freezing conditions  Soil invertebrates  important regulators of decomposition and nutrient cycling  showed higher diversity in sites where winter frost depths were shallow  compared to sites with deeper frost  Total abundances of soil invertebrates were not different between shallow and deeper frost sites  There was a potential link to changes in mineralization and nitrification rates  where sites with high freezing had lower nematode abundances and sites with lower freezing had higher nematode abundances while both types of sites had no measurable differences in microbial biomass  Nematodes may be an important regulator of N cycling rates in soils exposed to soil freezing via reductions in bacterial feeding nematodes  These results indicate complex relationships between organisms  ecosystem processes and changing climate and animals may modify a systems response to altered winter climate regimes       
Climate induced divergence in breeding population dynamics among Pygoscelis penguins  Nutritional physiological mechanisms and evolutionary consequences	  The southwestern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean  including the Bellingshausen Sea west of the Antarctica Peninsula  AP   is now strongly influenced by ocean climate warming  Average winter air temperature has increased ~6 deg C in association with a notable reduction in regional winter sea ice formation  particularly within the northern sector of the western AP  Marine community responses to regional warming are now evident  Especially marked are breeding population responses by Pygoscelis penguins including the sea ice obligate AdÈlie penguin   P   adeliae    in addition to the sea ice intolerant chinstrap   P   antarctica   and gentoo   P   papua   penguins  all of which are demonstrating pole ward shifts in bio geographic range mediated by environmental effects on demographic parameters  Using data collected over the 2008 2010 austral summers  we examine nutritional and physiological correlates of within and among species variation in individual reproductive performance of Pygoscelis penguins nesting near Anvers Island  an ecotone now shifting from a cold  dry polar climate to a warm  moist sub Antarctic system  Also  we consider latitudinal variation in reproductive performance among AdÈlie penguins nesting at Anvers Island  as well as 400 km south at Avian Island and 700 km south at Charcot Island  regions where sea ice remains a prominent physical feature  Analyses utilize naturally occurring ratios of carbon  d 13 C  and nitrogen  d 15 N  stable isotopes of penguin red blood cells as proxies of foraging niche and marine trophic structure  in addition to circulating levels of corticosterone  a primary glucocorticoid in avian homeostatic energetic balance  Using information theoretic methods  we show that among Pygoscelis penguins breeding at Anvers Island  egg production is driven by divergent nutrient sources across species  however  chick production is associated with similar nutrient sources by 5 weeks of age  suggesting that sea ice obligate AdÈlie penguins rear chicks using the same nutrient sources as their sub Antarctic congeners  AdÈlie penguin chicks reared at southern rookeries  where sea ice remains a prominent physical feature  are isotopically enriched relative to Anvers Island chicks  which is associated with higher size corrected body mass and lower corticosterone levels suggesting southern AdÈlie penguin chicks are in better condition prior to fledge than their northern conspecifics  Variation in marine trophic structure suggests that key sea ice associated prey drive latitudinal variation in AdÈlie penguin chick isotope signature and body condition  and may represent a critical environmental factor linking climate driven sea ice change  predator demography  and community structure       
Effects of climate driven lake level decline on coarse woody habitat and fishes Global climate change may influence freshwater fish populations through drought and changes in lake levels in addition to changes in other factors such as altered thermal or dissolved oxygen regimes  Littoral structures such as fallen trees      coarse woody habitat  CWH  can serve as critical fish habitat for prey production  refuge  and spawning  Yet  drought driven lake level declines may eliminate these structures from littoral zones  A prolonged drought in northern Wisconsin  USA allowed us to test for the effects of lake level decline on CWH availability and the response of fish populations  We examined lake level  the corresponding reduction in CWH  the relative abundance of the dominant forage fish species  yellow perch   Perca flavescens    and the density and growth of the popular game fish and top piscivore species  largemouth bass   Micropterus salmoides    in Little Rock Lake South from 2001 2005 and 2007 2009  We used regression models to test for  1  a relationship between lake level and submerged CWH available to fishes  and 2  the response of fishes to gradual  but sustained  losses in available CWH   Lake level of Little Rock Lake South declined over 1 1 m and more than 75% of the previously submerged CWH was lost from the littoral zone during 2001 2009  The loss of CWH coincided with the disappearance of yellow perch and reduced growth of largemouth bass  Our analysis indicated that the probability of detecting yellow perch was   50% at a 22% reduction in CWH    10% at a 37% reduction in CWH  and   1% at a 53% reduction in CWH  Growth rates of largemouth bass were density dependent and generally increased with CWH  However  the relationship between growth rate and CWH varied across fish length  To evaluate this relationship  we simulated growth trajectories of largemouth bass under low and high CWH conditions  Our simulations suggested that growth asymptotes prior to largemouth bass attaining the minimum length limit in the region  Our work shows that climate change can affect fish populations by altering the availability of littoral habitat  Furthermore  it suggests that resilience of game fish populations could be increased by proactive management strategies       
Sensitivity of north temperate lakes to past climatic variability and terrestrial disturbances over the past ca  200 years Understanding how freshwater ecosystems respond to changes in climatic drivers and interactions of climate with terrestrial disturbances over time are critical challenges in contemporary ecology  Paleoecological and paleolimnological research in conjunction with historical archival research  regional drought records  published climatic reconstructions  and data from the North Temperate Lakes LTER program were used to reveal changes in historical fire regimes and interactions of fire and land clearance disturbance with climatic variability over the past ca  200 years  Charcoal and pollen records from lake sediment cores were used to generate local disturbance histories around six northern Wisconsin lakes and event analyses were used to evaluate synchronicity of local fire disturbance with regional drought and global ENSO activity  Lake ecosystem responses to past climatic events and local disturbance events of fire and logging were investigated using paleolimnological analyses of sediment carbon and algal pigment concentrations Fire episodes were synchronous with drought events over a time period prior to historical clear cut logging  1810 1889 C E   and were not synchronous with drought over subsequent time periods  Fire episodes occurred closely in time  within    five years of one another  at all five sites only twice  ca  1890   1894 C E  and ca  1914   1916 C E   over the 200 year record  This turn of the century time period coincided with intensive regional land clearance and years of very strong to extreme La Ni ntilde a  suggesting that the clearcut logging of this period favored more widespread fire that may have been more responsive to very strong La Ni ntilde a conditions  Change point analyses of sediment carbon burial rates reveal significant change points in several lakes over this same time period while multivariate analyses of algal pigment concentrations show significant shifts in community structure  MANOVA  p    0 001  in lakes of low landscape positions over this same period of intensive land clearance and very strong ENSO activity  Results suggest that lakes occupying lower landscape positions may be more responsive to landscape disturbance than lakes in higher landscape positions but that lakes in both high and low positions show sensitivity to the combined effects of land clearance  strong ENSO activity  and multiyear droughts       
 Effects of watershed management on sources and fluxes of water  carbon  and nitrogen in streams  Climate implications  Due to the interactive effects of urbanization and climate variability  managing impacts on watershed hydrology and biogeochemical processing has become increasingly important  particularly due to the enhanced potential for eutrophication and hypoxia in downstream coastal ecosystems  We examined whether headwater management  stream restoration and stormwater management  impacts the sources and fluxes of water  nitrogen  and carbon from urban watersheds along space and time  We compared 4 watersheds of contrasting headwater management  2 urban degraded watersheds and 2 managed urban watersheds with stormwater best management practices  BMPs  and stream restoration  Surface water samples were collected biweekly at 4 USGS gauging stations located within each watershed for 2 years across baseflow and storms  and watersheds were also sampled longitudinally during 4 seasons  Sources of water  nitrate  and carbon were investigated using isotopic and spectroscopic tracer techniques  Annual fluxes of water  N  and C  were estimated using the USGS program LOADEST  Flow duration analysis indicated that watershed management reduced pulsing of stormflow and increased baseflow runoff  Water isotope data showed no significant differences between sources of water for the managed and degraded stream sites  Elevated levels of indicator anions  F     Cl     I     SO 4 2    as well as greater   pulses   of C and N over time in the degraded vs  managed watersheds indicate potential sewage sources due to leaky sanitary sewers and greater stormdrain inputs  Nitrate isotope data also showed that degraded streams have significantly greater nitrate  p    0 05  from atmospheric and potential sewage sources  Based on spectral carbon quality indices  degraded sites were found to have significantly  p    0 05  more labile/aquatic sourced  and less terrestrial organic matter than managed streams  The degraded watersheds consistently showed highly variable  and more   pulsed   fluxes for N and C and indicator anions than the managed watersheds  While the managed watersheds showed lower total annual export for C  the annual N exports were not consistently lower than the degraded watersheds  However  most of the C and N was exported during higher flows in the degraded watersheds  while most nutrient export for managed watersheds was during baseflow  Overall  the source tracking data indicate that most nitrogen and carbon originates from near stream sources  which  when unmanaged  may contribute disproportionately to watershed fluxes  particularly during extreme hydrologic events  Our results also suggest that watershed management strategies have the potential to dampen pulses of streamflow  sources  and reduce fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in urbanizing watersheds experiencing climate variability       
 Community and ecosystem scale responses to precipitation variability and extremes in semiarid grasslands  shrublands and woodlands  Soil water availability is the principal control on plant function in semiarid regions  In the southwestern USA  climate change is expected to generally increase aridity as well as the frequency of severe drought  To investigate the causes and consequences of plant  community and ecosystem responses to extreme events  we conducted a series of manipulative experiments in grama grassland  creosote bush shrubland and pinon juniper woodland ecosystems at the Sevilleta LTER  In each ecosystem  rainout shelters were used to sustain severe drought for five years  In grassland  precipitation variability was also manipulated by supplementing monsoon rainfall or excluding monsoon rainfall entirely and replacing it with many small events or a small number of large events  Measurements of cover  productivity  leaf level gas exchange and/or sap flow were used to assess drought impacts and acclimation to experimentally altered water availability  The ecosystem consequences of observed pinon mortality were assessed using eddy flux measurements at a nearby ecosystem scale girdling experiment that simulated pinon mortality during extreme drought In all ecosystems  severe drought limited plant function  Grass cover decreased with sustained drought in both Black grama grassland and in a mixed grass shrub community in the ecotone between grassland and shrubland  In shrubland  there was little change in shrub cover after five years of drought  although leaf area index decreased  In pinon juniper woodland  severe drought led to rapid pinon mortality on hillslope plots  and was associated with with bark beetle activity  Hillslope juniper exhibited progressive branch dieback leading to slow mortality during years 2 5 of the experiment  On deeper soils with less slope both pinon and juniper survived for five years before pinon mortality began  During this extended drought  both pinon and juniper exhibited growth limitations  decreased leaf area and acclimation of gas exchange and hydraulic characteristics  Ecosystem scale measurements of carbon fluxes following girdling revealed that carbon sequestration decreased by 50%  The expected increases in respiration associated with decomposition of the dead trees and increases in understory production lagged the girdling treatment by nearly two years while surface temperatures increased due to altered energy balance  Our results suggest that future changes in precipitation regime and drought frequency will alter plant performance and survival with consequences for community composition and ecosystem structure and function       
Altering rainfall amount and pattern affects above  and belowground productivity differently among three US grassland types	    By the end of the 21 st century  climate models forecast drastic shifts in precipitation amount and pattern  event size and number  globally  These responses will likely be highly variable among ecosystem types  highlighting the need for greater understanding of climate change ecosystem responses among sites spanning regional biotic and abiotic gradients  Grasslands are experimentally tractable ecosystems that span much of the central US  We chose this biome to address the overarching question  How sensitive are different grassland types to changes in precipitation amount and pattern  During the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons  we experimentally augmented natural rainfall inputs into three different grassland types in two ways  1  by adding small events weekly throughout the growing season  MS   many small treatment   and 2  by adding water on top of large ambient rainstorms a few times during the growing season  FL  few large treatment   Both treatments received the same total precipitation  and responses  above and belowground net productivity  ANPP and BNPP  respectively  were measured for comparison with ambient plots  in which no water was added  The three grasslands selected differed in plant community composition  C 3 vs  C 4 grass dominance  and annual precipitation amounts  321 840 mm   They were located at  the Central Plains Experimental Range near Nunn  CO  shortgrass steppe   the Fort Keogh Agricultural Research Station near Miles City  MT  northern mixed grass prairie   and the Konza Prairie Biological Station near Manhattan  KS  tallgrass prairie    ANPP was significantly increased by water addition in the shortgrass steppe and tallgrass prairie while only in the shortgrass steppe did precipitation pattern matter    the FL treatment increased productivity relative to ambient plots  but the MS treatment did not  Similarly  BNPP responses to rainfall amount also occurred in both shortgrass steppe and tallgrass prairie  Here  the MS treatment increased BNPP only in the shortgrass steppe whereas the FL treatment increased production only in tallgrass prairie relative to ambient  Total productivity  ANPP + BNPP  responded to precipitation amount in both shortgrass steppe and tallgrass prairie  with neither pattern of addition having an effect on total productivity  In contrast to these two C 4 dominated grasslands  the C 3 dominated northern mixed grass prairie did not respond to precipitation amount or pattern in either year  This suggests that the cooler northern mixed grass prairie may rely more on non growing season precipitation inputs and thus that there is substantial variability in central US grassland sensitivity to forecast changes in precipitation regimes       
Plant diversity enhances soil microbial biomass and functions irrespective of warming scenarios Anthropogenic changes in biodiversity and atmospheric temperature rise significantly influence ecosystem processes  However  little is known about the interactive effects of biodiversity and warming on soil microbial biomass and functions in grassland  Here  we report results from the BAC experiment  Biodiversity And Climate  in Cedar Creek  MN  USA  where we studied effects of varying plant diversity  1  4  and 16 species  and temperature rise  ambient  +1 5 deg C  and +3 deg C  on soil microbial biomass  respiration  nutrient limitations  and activities of extracellular enzymes in 2011 and 2012  The focal enzymes are involved in essential biogeochemical processes of the carbon cycle  cellobiohydrolase   szlig  1 4 glucosidase   szlig  1 4 N acetylglucosaminidase  Phenol oxidase and Peroxidase   nitrogen cycle  urease   and phosphorus cycle  acid phosphatase  We found fairly consistent results in both years  Soil microbial biomass as well as most enzyme activities increased significantly with increasing plant diversity  However  we found no significant warming effects on soil microbial properties suggesting temperature optima for soil organisms are sufficiently broad to buffer them against small changes in temperature  In contrast to our expectations  we also found no interactive effects of plant diversity and warming indicating that plant diversity significantly influences soil microbial properties irrespective of warming scenarios  Overall  we found plant diversity to strongly affect soil microorganisms across years and temperature treatments whereas temperature had non significant effects on soil microorganisms and microbial functions  pointing to the significance of plant diversity in driving belowground processes       
Effects of experimental warming on a grassland insect and spider community One of the major threats to Earth  s biodiversity is climate change  To date  most ecological studies of the impacts of climate warming on earth  s biota are focused on select species or single trophic levels  Multi species warming studies tend to be observational  exploring phenology changes or range shifts  There is a need for rigorous experimental investigation of the impact of climate warming on the structure and function of entire multi trophic communities  I am investigating the impacts of warming on the community structure of insects and spiders in a tallgrass prairie heating experiment  At Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve  an LTER site in Minnesota  plots of vegetation are warmed using overhead heating elements  but otherwise left open to sun  wind  and rain  Thirty eight plots with varying plant species richness are continuously heated to approximately 2 5  ordm C above ambient  which corresponds with predictions of temperature increase in the upper Midwest region of 2 3  ordm C by 2050  Paired control plots are unheated  In 2010  I collected insects and spiders in each of the 38 heated and 38 control plots using a modified Blow  Vac suction apparatus  The insects were sorted and identified to family level  were measured  and were assigned to trophic position and guild A total of 5 177 insects and spiders were collected  Initial analyses show that across all insects  there are approximately 24% more individuals and 51% greater insect biovolume in warmer plots  The increase in biomass is driven both by the increase in number of individuals and the size of individuals  While no one insect group is responsible for the differences between warmed and control plots  some groups appear to respond more to warming  Araneae  spiders   Lepidoptera  moths and butterflies   and Thysanoptera  thrips  had significantly higher biovolume in warmed plots       
 Evolutionary change depends on community context in BioCON  a long term field study  Understanding how species adapt to environmental change is critically important  yet most experimental studies investigate adaptation on single isolated species  This is problematic as species do not live in isolation    they live in complex communities where they interact with many other species  Because ecological interactions  such as competition  can directly alter fitness components  the direction of selection  and population size  studies on isolated species may not accurately predict the response to environmental change in complex communities  We investigated how community context influences evolution in a natural ecosystem exposed to elevated carbon dioxide  CO 2    Fieldwork was carried out in a long term ecological experiment  BioCON  at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota  BioCON was initiated in 1997 and maintains differing diversities of plants  from 1 to 16 species  under ambient or elevated CO 2 conditions  In June 2011 we collected Poa pratensis  Kentucky Bluegrass  seeds from plots that were kept as either monocultures or 16 species plots under ambient and elevated CO 2 conditions  We then grew these seeds in a common garden environment to reduce maternal effects  From these common garden plants we collected rhizomes that we transplanted back into the BioCON plots using a full reciprocal transplant design Results from our transplant experiment indicated that both plastic and genetic changes occurred in response to elevated CO 2   with the magnitude of such changes influenced by species diversity in the plot of origin  We found significant main effects of diversity  p  0 001  and CO 2  p  0 05  in the environment into which rhizomes were transplanted on all traits measured  indicating plastic trait responses independent of the environment from which the rhizomes originated  We also found that the environment from which rhizomes originated significantly affected the number of leaves produced by each plant  CO 2   p  0 01  diversity  p  0 001   suggesting that plants have adapted via genetic change in this trait to their local conditions  In addition to these main effects we found several interactions  such as diversity origin x diversity current  p  0 05  and CO 2 origin x diversity origin x CO 2 current  p  0 05  for plant height  These interactions demonstrate that the community context in which a species has evolved has influenced the extent of adaptation to local conditions  Overall  these results indicate that the diversity of the competitive community can influence how species evolve to deal with changing abiotic conditions       
Combined impacts of rarity and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity at species range limits	    The population and genetic impact of climate change at species range limits will take place in the context of a landscape altered by human land use  For many species  the forces associated with a loss of genetic diversity with range expansion  founder effects  bottlenecks  will interact with additional loss of diversity from habitat fragmentation  reduced population size  dispersal limitation   We combined long term vegetation data  historical surveys and paleoecological data  with genetic data  microsatellite variation  to quantify past impacts of climate and land use on American beech across a gradient from central to peripheral populations  We expected reduced genetic diversity in marginal populations  but it was not clear whether secondary forests  reforesting following agricultural abandonment  would recover genetic diversity in primary forests  whether they would lose diversity due to limited gene flow  or whether they would gain diversity through colonization from differentiated source populations characteristic of marginal habitats   Genetic variation in fragments of primary forests confirmed expectations from previous studies  forest fragments maintained substantial genetic diversity  this diversity was reduced in peripheral populations  which were also more strongly differentiated due to the long term isolation of these marginal habitats  Secondary forests in central populations recovered most genetic diversity of the forest fragments from which they originated  but secondary forests in marginal habitats failed to recover genetic diversity  As climate driven range expansions and contractions combine with habitat degradation and recovery this century  we need to understand the implications of their interactions  In this case  populations of a late successional species are slowly recovering in the century since agricultural abandonment  but the recovery of genetic diversity in these forests is not occurring at the same rate in marginal habitats       
Spatial projections of past and future distributions to inform managing tree diversity under climate change Species distribution models are currently in wide use among ecologists for projecting how species may respond to projected future climates with the intent  at least in some cases  to advise management on how to respond to the threat of climate change  Species distribution models may identify areas of future risk and security within a current range  as well as identify potential future habitat  Species distribution models  however  carry a large number of stringent assumptions  I examine assumptions in the light of a common suite of forest management actions in order to focus how ecologists might best frame tree distribution modeling to assist in managing for tree diversity under changing climates  Modeling issues examined include distinguishing fundamental and realized niches  the importance of biotic interactions  including disturbance  dispersal limitation  and adaptive capacity  Focal management actions I consider are fire management and planting  including planting species outside their current distributions  managed relocation   The focal study region that I assess is the Sierra Nevada range of California  where we have used an integrated team of scientists to assess forest vulnerability to climate change and fire The assumptions of species distribution models virtually all have the potential to underestimate the potential of species to persist within their current distributions  Focusing on trees  the model assumption that a current occurrence reflects the capacity to recruit under the current climate is problematic in long lived species such as trees  Differential climatic tolerances of seedlings versus adults  again may constraint the accuracy of distribution models to predict future outcomes  Species distribution models are likely to be considerably more robust in predicting potential future suitable habitat than they are at predicting range losses as a consequence of emerging climatic unsuitability  Further  biotic interactions can be a driver of population success  but modeling biotic interactions remains a challenge  Given the long life span of trees  management responses to habitat losses may manifest soonest in disturbance driven systems where fire can drive site type change  Other changes may be gradual and slow  In contrast  recruitment into new locations may be limited by dispersal  As a consequence  focusing modeling efforts on where  when and why range expansions should be fostered in trees is likely the best use of distribution modeling for climate change in trees       
Looking back to see ahead  Considering genetic divergence within tree species to anticipate responses to climate change Tree species are not genetically uniform across their ranges  Geological  climatological and ecological processes partially or entirely isolate evolutionary lineages within species  These lineages may develop adaptations to different local environmental conditions  and may eventually evolve into distinct forms or species  Isolation also can reduce adaptive genetic variation within populations of a species  potentially compromising their ability to respond to climate change  Dramatic climate changes during the Pleistocene  for example  caused species ranges to contract and fragment into isolated glacial refugia before expanding and reconnecting  The genetic signals of these processes remain in several species  and are useful in guiding gene conservation strategies  Often  the current   trailing edges   of species ranges  which tend to be nearer past glacial refugia  contain considerable genetic variation and represent high levels of within species differentiation  Such within species evolutionary differences should be considered when predicting species responses to climate change  We do so for two widespread North American forest tree species  ponderosa pine   Pinus ponderosa   and eastern hemlock   Tsuga canadensis    applying results from range wide molecular marker assessments and an innovative climate change modeling method  Specifically  we used the multivariate spatio temporal clustering  MSTC  technique to predict how within species evolutionary lineages might respond to climate change  Using the same tools  we also assessed whether populations possessing rare alleles or diminished genetic variation might experience the greatest climate change pressure  In ponderosa pine  we detected and mapped 10 mitochondrial  mtDNA  haplotypes from 3 100 trees across 104 populations  Each is an evolutionarily distinct unit that may be evolving separately and responding differently to climate change  Our environmental suitability maps  in fact  predict different climate responses for the Rocky Mountain and Pacific haplotypes of ponderosa pine  Meanwhile  our analyses of 13 microsatellite molecular markers in eastern hemlock  from 1 180 trees across 60 populations  suggest that the species consists of three or four evolutionary lineages descending from separate Pleistocene glacial refugia  These lineages face differing degrees of risk from climate change  Additionally  peripheral disjunct populations are significantly less genetically diverse than main range populations in eastern hemlock  but some are highly genetically differentiated or contain unique alleles  Under climate change  these disjunct populations are among the farthest from projected future acceptable environmental conditions  This synthesis of phylogeography  population genetics and risk analysis should assist management and conservation planning for these widespread and ecologically important forest tree species in the face of climate change       
The impact of biotic interactions on seedling recruitment during tree range expansion Climate change is expected to initiate a process of poleward range expansion for many plant species and range expansion rates will be determined by the success of individuals establishing beyond their range margins  However  these migrant individuals will be establishing in communities which are novel for their species  and biotic interactions with indigenous herbivores and pathogens are likely to impact seedling recruitment  If biotic interactions are strong  they could contribute to the success or failure of a species to migrate  To investigate the role of biotic interactions in range expansion we conducted a transplant experiment and quantified the interactions between migrant plants and existing communities  In this study we address the following questions  1  Do migrant seedlings experience less herbivory and disease in their new ranges than native seedlings  2  Are migrant species exposed to less herbivory and disease than in their native range  3  How important is this to plant growth and survival  Ten species of woody plants were planted within and beyond their current distributional ranges and foliar herbivory  pathogen activity  growth  and survival were monitored for three years  Seedlings were also planted across light and moisture gradients at each site to separate the effects of environmental covariates that could also affect establishment Herbivory rates at higher latitudinal sites were higher for many species  but were especially high for some migrant species including Carya glabra and Robinia psuedoacacia   Herbivory had significant effects on seedling survival  and although the results are highly species specific  we show examples of how biotic resistance is preventing the establishment of certain lower latitude species in the higher latitude communities  In contrast  pathogen activity was often significantly lower for plants occurring beyond their current range  migrant seedlings had lower percentages of their leaf area affected by foliar pathogen activity over the growing season  compared to indigenous plants  Our results establish that interactions with herbivores and pathogens differ within and beyond range edges for certain species and confirm the importance of these interactions to seedling growth and survival  In doing so  our study shows that  at least in the short term  release from pathogens could give some migrant species an advantage over native competitors whereas native herbivores could help prevent some potential migrants from establishing beyond their original ranges  Overall  we demonstrate that biotic interactions will influence plant range expansion and highlight the importance of including biotic interactions in predictions of short term plant range shifts       
Processes at work on North American tree species range edges have implications for the predictability of their movements under climate change Predicting how climate change will influence tree species distributions requires understanding abiotic constraints on species as well as biotic interactions such as competition and disease  So far  predictions have been largely based on abiotic conditions because biotic interactions are notoriously difficult to understand and predict  as well as expected to vary across species   ranges  A classic expectation is that species are limited by climate  namely cold temperatures and/or arid conditions  at some range edges  while at other edges  in the absence of abiotically harsh limits  biotic interactions  such as competition  limits species   ranges  Insights into the nature of constraining factors at range edges will improve predictions of range shifts under climate change  A range edge mainly caused by harshness of climate is more likely to directly trace shifts in climate  than a range edge mainly caused by biotic interactions  Our goal is to identify the nature of range edges and to highlight differences in resulting predictions for range shifts for models ignoring or incorporating insights on the nature of range edges  We use three different models for accomplishing this goal  Distribution models for the realized niche  Phenofit for the fundamental niche  and MAPSS for the competition landscape Most of the 13 modeled tree species show the expected patterns of climate limiting northern edges and competition limiting southern edges  Consequently  predictions for range shifts coincide between different approaches much more closely for the northern range edges  than the southern range edges  Southern range edges are vastly overpredicted by climate envelopes and mechanistic  climate based models  Phenofit   It is unclear whether better prediction of southern range edges by classical correlational distribution models is related to mechanism  for example via implicit modeling of competitors  Therefore  it is also unclear how reliable such models could predict future distributions  However  clear advances can be made by combining climate based mechanistic models  Phenofit  addressing the fundamental niche  with general expected competition landscapes  MAPSS  for predicting the future of the notoriously fuzzy southern range edges       
Incorporating range position and temporal stability of projected changes in tree species habitats to assess regional climate change vulnerability As we consider the potential impacts of climate change on tree species  we are confronted with the challenge of relating how such global perturbations intersect with a multitude of regional environmental challenges  Many of these near term factors operate at a more rapid temporal and finer spatial dimension  To assess climate change vulnerabilities within a regional context  we must place climate change impacts into a more applicable domain  Here we demonstrate one pathway to increase the utility of coarse scale species distribution models for regional vulnerability assessments  Specially  building from our series of 134 tree species distribution models for the eastern US  DISTRIB  and projected habitat responses under a range of GCMs  we address how to create a species distributional boundary which aligns within a focal area to estimate the likely tree species pool  how  considering the rate of projected change over the course of the 21 st century  1990  2040  2070  2100  can characterize the temporal immediacy of the risks  and finally  how the stability of the projected habitat change builds confidence into vulnerably assessments  Our results are from four regions within the eastern US  Northern Wisconsin  WI   Western Maine  ME   Central Pennsylvania  PA   and Coastal South Carolina  SC  These disparate regions clearly demonstrate how the regional context of assessing vulnerability can influence conclusions regarding potential changes in forest composition through time  For example  across chestnut oak  s range  we show high consistency in a projected mild increase in habitat by the end of the century  especially within the heart of it distribution  PA   However  at the periphery of its range  we see marked disagreement in the stability of habitat changes  e g   in ME the differences between high and low emissions scenario predictions are greater than the magnitude of projected increases under high emissions   Further  by considering the range position of a species relative to the location of interest we reduce the number of potential candidate species to consider in a vulnerability assessment  Finally  with the inclusion of projections for each species at 30 year intervals we track the trajectory and speed of when suitable habitat may become available for a species  For example  black ash in WI shows a potential marked reduction in habitat within the next 30 years  while for other species  the greatest potential for habitat change is delayed until the end of the century  These results provide a means rapidly comparing regional climate change vulnerabilities for forests       
Tree suitable habitats and colonization potential dynamics at range boundaries under climate change   an integrated modelling perspective Changes in climate forecast for this century is likely to cause shifts in suitable habitats for various tree species including the creation of some novel assemblages of community types  These habitats will be differentially colonized by the species  based on landscape heterogeneity and species interactions  Our integrated multi stage approach consists of using decision tree ensembles to predict current and future suitable habitats of 134 tree species in the eastern US  with climate  soil and elevation variables as predictors  DISTRIB   The colonization potential of suitable habitats is estimated by using a spatially explicit cellular model called SHIFT  It uses a fat tailed dispersal kernel mimicking historical migration rates  thereby enabling source regions to differentially colonize suitable fragmented sink habitats  revealing dispersal constraints beyond the current species boundary  Combining DISTRIB and SHIFT enables us to assess colonization potential under future climates and explore suitable migration pathways  Biological and disturbance factors not considered by DISTRIB and SHIFT can modify final outcomes  and are hard to model  These are separately evaluated using a weighted decision support system  ModFacs  that examines 9 biological and 12 disturbance factors to distill DISTRIB+SHIFT results in order to facilitate communication of model uncertainty and likely outcomes Several groups of tree species were examined using our integrated multi stage approach to spatially evaluate the nature of habitat variability as well as colonization potential near range margins  Predominantly climate driven species  eg  oaks  can extend their suitable habitats northward under warming climate  Using our integrated approach  we show a  how the carbon emission pathway humanity adopts can affect future species habitat availability  b  that the likelihood of oaks colonizing the large northern habitats available to them in the future  is low due to dispersal constraints c  what mitigating factors can operate for vulnerable northern species  like aspen birch and spruce fir which are predicted to lose suitable habitats in the eastern US  and d  how DISTRIB+SHIFT can be used to evaluate suitable patches and corridors to facilitate migration of vulnerable species  Our macro scale  integrated modelling approach is one among many needed to uncover the multi faceted and dynamic effects of the rapidly increasing anthropogenic impacts on tree habitats       
Accounting for adaptive potential and migration capacity in species distribution models  conservation and management applications A number of assumptions underpinning the use of species distribution models to predict biological responses to climate change are violated for temperate and boreal tree species that are widespread  long lived  and genetically adapted to local climate conditions  To address this situation we propose a methodology to account for the potential effects of genetic structure  adaptive potential and limited migration capacity  Similar to the widely used   no migration   and   unlimited migration   scenarios  we employ more refined biological response scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of genetic adaptation to local environments and the capacity of species to adapt and migrate  These scenarios are realized by two sets of geographic delineations that partition the species range into multiple populations  and that subdivide the study area into smaller landscape units  In a two case studies for western Canada  we demonstrate how the approach can be used to evaluate the adequacy of a protected areas system  and reforestation guidelines to ensure the maintenance of forest genetic resources for 48 tree species  We find that between 35% and 85% of locally adapted populations in protected areas are maintained under a median climate change scenario until the end of the century  Nevertheless  we find that on average populations already lag behind their optimal climate niche by approximately 130km in latitude  or 60m in elevation  For the 2020s we expect an average lag of approximately 310km in latitude or 140m in elevation  with the most pronounced geographic lags in the Rocky Mountains and the boreal forest  We propose that the results of species distribution models have practical value for conservation planning if the focus is on maintenance rather than loss of suitable habitat  Accounting for genetic structure  adaptive potential  and migration capacity through best case and worst case scenarios provides important information to effectively allocate limited resources available for conservation action  and to guide seed transfer in reforestation programs to optimally match genotypes with anticipated planting environments       
Demographically driven distribution models  Advantages of using integral projection models to incorporate demography into species distribution models Species Distribution Models  SDMs  e g  Maxent  GARP  GLMs  etc   are typically used to describe the correlation between occurrence patterns and environmental covariates  Often  these methods are used because species   presence  and sometimes absence  at locations on a landscape are the only available population level data  While this class of SDMs is useful for exploring spatial occurrence data  they offer limited insights into the underlying population biology that generates these patterns because occurrence patterns entangle a variety of processes such as demography  dispersal  biotic interactions and historical effects  Here  we show how to use a limited amount of demographic data to produce Demographically Driven Distribution Models  DDDMs  using Integral Projection Models  IPMs  for stage structured populations  By modeling vital rate functions such as survival  growth  and fecundity using regression  they can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data  DDDMs offer at least five advantages over occurrence based SDMs   1  DDDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of the demographic processes that generate spatial occurrence patterns   2  DDDMs predict more biologically meaningful demographic summaries of population patterns such as population growth rate  life expectancy  or stage distributions   3  DDDMs can avoid issues of aggregation by modeling how individuals respond to weather  rather than modeling how a species responds to climate   4  DDDMs allow for more robust extrapolation under new environmental conditions  e g  climate change  because one can more readily evaluate the consequences of extrapolating a vital rate representing single biological process than an occurrence probability that entangles multiple processes   5  DDDMs can predict temporal dynamics  in contrast to the typically static predictions of SDMs  To illustrate these principles  we construct DDDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa by combining data from a variety of sources  We compare these models to SDMs that predict occurrence probability and illustrate inference about the demographic processes that drive differences in habitat suitability       
 Climatic and biotic velocities for woody taxa distributions over the last 16 000 years in eastern North America 	  At present  there is intense interest in whether rates of species distribution shifts will be able to keep pace with the projected rates of climate velocity  However  it is an open question whether rates of response to rising temperatures will be faster for northerly  expanding  or southerly  contracting  populations within a species distribution  We estimated the latitudinal velocity  km/decade  of northern and southern boundaries of core distributions for 30 woody taxa over the last 16 000 years  biotic velocities  using networks of fossil pollen records  and compared these to climate velocities estimated from CCSM3 simulations Biotic velocities were faster during periods of rapid temperature change       16 to 7ka  than times of relative stability       7 to 1ka   with a consistent northward movement of northern and southern boundaries  For most taxa  biotic velocities were faster for northern than for southern boundaries between 12 and 7ka  resulting in expanding distributions  For individual time periods  biotic velocities were as fast or faster than climate velocities calculated using multivariate approaches  These results indicate that climate change paced the rate of distribution shifts in both northern and southern populations while suggesting that northern populations were more sensitive  A similar sensitivity and pacing is expected under 21 st  century climate change       
 Long term silviculture experiments impact stand level weather sensitivity  resistance  and resilience  Extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change  and numerous studies have demonstrated the often intimate association between climate variability and tree growth  Evidence suggests that manipulation of forest structure can influence how trees respond to extreme weather events  We used detailed dendrochronological data from four long term experimental forests in the upper Lakes States  Minnesota and Wisconsin  and New England  New Hampshire and Maine  to examine how the relationships between inter annual tree biomass increment and climate variability are affected by long term management regime  The silvicultural experiments resulted in a diversity of stand structural and compositional conditions  Given the effects of stand structure on growing conditions and tree response to severe weather  we examined the following questions  1  which monthly and seasonal climate variables most affect stand level biomass increment   2  How are stand resistance and resilience to extreme weather events affected by stand structure  We used dendrochronological techniques  historic climate data  and response function analysis to identify the importance of climate variables and timing of those variables to annual biomass increment  To calculate resistance and resilience of stands during and after extreme weather events  we used historic inventory measurements and tree ring analysis to calculate historic stand structure and biomass increment In red pine dominated communities in the Lake States  growth was positively associated with higher spring temperatures and summer precipitation  but negatively associated with higher fall temperatures in all treated plots  Manipulation of stand density appeared to reduce climate sensitivity in northern hardwood systems in the Lake States  as only untreated  control plots showed a response to climate variability with a negative association with summer temperature  An opposite trend was detected in the more humid northern hardwood sites in New Hampshire  where growth in control plots had no significant correlations with climate  and growth in some treated plots was positively correlated with spring and summer temperature and precipitation  In Maine  growth in some treatments was positively correlated with higher spring and summer temperatures and fall moisture  Initial results suggest that stand level resistance and recovery are not affected by stand structure  but resilience is affected  Overall  these results indicate that alterations to stand structure via management treatments may impart differential responses to climate variability  with impacts varying according to prevailing climatic regime and composition  An understanding of these relationships will help inform future management decisions aimed at reducing climate change impacts       
Characterizing the differential sensitivity of tree species and forest types to past weather variability using dendrochronological techniques Tree biomass growth results from physiological processes that are sensitive to annual variations in temperature  precipitation and potential evapotranspiration  Dendrochronological analyses aimed at past climate reconstructions often employ standardization techniques that magnify the signal of tree growth variance that is correlated to climate  This approach tends to factor out variance in growth caused by characteristics such as tree size  age  species  competitive status  and stand density  However  the relative variance in growth attributed to climate fluctuations vs  forest structural characteristics is rarely quantified  We asked  a   how traditional dendrochronological techniques can help predict forest biomass growth  and  b   whether the variance in growth due to weather variability is as important as other factors  We reconstructed tree  species and stand biomass increments using a census dataset of tree rings from eight forest communities covering the temperate and boreal forests in northern Minnesota  We used mixed models to predict annual biomass growth from tree size and age  stand density and aggregate growth trends  species and local site characteristics  and variations in annual precipitation  temperature and summer moisture deficit using PRISM climate data  1895 2009   We used dendrochronological response function analysis to guide climate variable selection We found that mean tree biomass growth depended most strongly  and positively  on tree size  age  and competitive status  while weather variability typically explained less than 5% of total variance in growth  Growth relationships varied significantly by species  with higher than average growth seen in species such as Acer saccharum and Populus tremuloides and lower than average growth in Fraxinus nigra and Thuja occidentalis   Variations in biomass growth around the mean were significantly related to the summer ratio of precipitation to PET  though growth often lagged summer conditions by one to two years depending on species and site  Variables selected by response function analysis did not always perform better than standard seasonal climate variables  While weather fluctuations significantly affect growth  our results suggest that changes in forest composition and structure are more important to predict short term productivity responses to climate change       
The tradeoff of maximizing forest carbon storage and resiliency to disturbance  An assessment using long term ponderosa pine density management growth data The increase in atmospheric CO2 and its role in global climate change have encouraged the search for ways to reduce or offset greenhouse gas emissions  Forests store a substantial amount of carbon  Therefore  we continue to seek forest management strategies that could be used to mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and carbon sequestration  One strategy often explored is to maintain high stocking levels to maximize forest carbon storage  However  this strategy ignores several possible consequences such as reduced resiliency to disturbances such as wildfire and insect epidemics  which are projected to increase in frequency as a result of climate change  To explore these tradeoffs  we use data from a ponderosa pine density management study established in the 1960s on the Black Hills Experimental Forest  Six density levels  ranging from 5 to 28 ft2/ac  were established in even aged 55 to 65 year old ponderosa pine stands  Diameter and height growth and mortality were measured periodically from 1963 to 2010  Using this information  live carbon storage and sequestration was calculated for each stocking level  In addition  we assessed crown fire hazard and mortality susceptibility to wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestation   Over the 47 years of measurements  carbon storage and sequestration increased with stand density  However  stands with higher density levels had substantially increased crown fire hazard due to the increased canopy bulk density  Furthermore  these higher density stands had trees 10 to 15 cm smaller than the lower density stands  These higher density stands with smaller diameter trees would experience substantial levels of mortality if exposed to wildfire  reducing the amount of live carbon storage  Furthermore  the higher density stands were more susceptible to the mountain pine beetle epidemic that occurred in the area in 2010  These results demonstrate that maximizing carbon storage in high density even aged stands in ponderosa pine is likely not the best strategy due to the increased mortality risk  Rather  if even aged stands are to be used for carbon storage  moderate density stands  which are more resilient to crown fire hazard and less susceptibility to wildfire and/or insect mortality  should be used       
Regional signatures of plant response to climate across North American deserts  Forecasts for management and planning Future warming and changes in the patterns of precipitation predicted by climate models can have a strong impact on plant species already stressed by low water availability in North American deserts  Accurate forecasts of climate induced changes in desert plant species assemblages are needed by managers because dryland ecosystems are prone to abrupt and potentially irreversible degradation and reductions in productivity  To better inform management responses to broad scale climate change impacts  we have synthesized over a century  1906 2012  of climate and vegetation monitoring results from nearly 1500 plots across the Colorado Plateau  Sonoran  Chihuahuan  and Mojave Deserts In all deserts  we demonstrate both linear and nonlinear responses of dominant plant species and plant diversity to drought and elevated temperature  Our results from the Colorado Plateau reveal large declines of cool season perennial bunchgrasses primarily driven by high temperatures  In the Sonoran Desert  there were increases in cacti with hotter temperatures  as well as reductions in warm season perennial grasses and subshrubs with less annual precipitation  Trees and shrubs were less responsive to changing climatic conditions  but many species were sensitive to warmer temperatures and less winter precipitation  especially on south facing slopes  In the Chihuahuan Desert  many grasses and forbs had large responses to summer precipitation  whereas most woody vegetation had small responses to winter precipitation  Our results from the Mojave Desert show declines of shrubs at some sites related to reductions in winter precipitation  Cross site and cross desert comparisons reveal differences in how plants respond to climate  and the importance of soil  landscape  and biotic characteristics in modifying responses  We highlight   climate pivot points   that mark important shifts from increases to decreases in plant abundance along climatic gradients  These results are being used to assist with management decisions  improve monitoring protocols  and inform climate change vulnerability assessments for land managers       
Climate change insights from long term soil moisture data collected across a desert basin With global climate change  an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events is predicted for many ecosystems  including extreme drought and wet periods  In arid and semiarid ecosystems  plant community composition and production is primarily limited by soil water availability  Thus  changes to the timing  duration  and depth of plant available water  PAW  due to extreme climatic events may have profound effects on future ecosystem processes and services in these systems  Soil properties  landscape topography  and soil vegetation feedbacks can control the depth  amount  and duration of PAW in the soil profile  In addition to affecting current dynamics  these relatively static properties will potentially impact plant community resilience to climate change  Soil water dynamics of deep desert vadose zones are often difficult to model due to extensive soil development and landscape heterogeneity  Thus  to understand how climate change will affect PAW and soil water balance in many desert systems  analysis of long term PAW measurements are needed  To address this need  we analyze a 23 year record of soil water content collected across varying soil types  landscape positions and plant communities on the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research site southern New Mexico USA  We use the weather variability  as a surrogate for climatic variability  and range of soils  vegetation  and topographic setting represented in the dataset to evaluate how resilience to climatic change varies across the landscape The 23 year record presented illustrates the importance of rare weather events and soil topography plant community feedbacks for patterns of PAW in this system  Broad scale deep wetting only occurred during the two extreme  multiyear wet events captured by this study  Rates and depths of wetting in response to precipitation varied greatly among sites  During a nearly 10 yr period with low precipitation  long term whole profile soil drying occurred basin wide but rates of drying differed among soil types and landscape settings  Some of the most stable sources of available water in this landscape occurred either deep in the soil profile     200 cm   in partially cemented horizons  at ~100 cm   or in run in locations  Shallow water sources     50 cm  were typically very unpredictable in the summer growing season but were more predictable in the late winter  We then present a conceptual model  based on spatiotemporal patterns in PAW  of how resilience to climate change will likely differ among soil  vegetation  and landscape settings in arid ecosystems       
Can the past predict the future  Experimental tests of historically based population models A frequently advocated approach for forecasting the population level impacts of climate change is to project models based on historical  observational relationships between climate and demographic rates  Despite the potential pitfalls of this approach  few historically based population models have been experimentally validated  We conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to test population models fit to observational data collected from the 1930's to the 1970's for six prairie forb species  We used the historical population models to predict experimental responses to the precipitation manipulations  and compared these predictions to ones generated by a statistical model fit directly to the experimental data For three species  a sensitivity analysis of the effects of precipitation and grass cover on forb population growth showed consistent results for the historical population models and the contemporary statistical models  Furthermore  the historical population models predicted population growth rates in the experimental plots as well or better than the statistical models  ignoring variation explained by spatial random effects and local density dependence  However  for the remaining three species  the sensitivity analyses showed that the historical and statistical models predicted opposite effects of precipitation on population growth  and the historical models were very poor predictors of experimental responses  For these species  historical observations were not well replicated in space  and for two of them the historical precipitation demography correlations were weak  Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of observational and experimental approaches  and increase our confidence in extrapolating historical relationships to predict population responses to climate change  at least when the historical correlations are strong and based on well replicated observations       
Using long term datasets to examine effects of disturbance and climate change on ecosystem function in forested headwater streams Climate change scenarios predict altered precipitation  particularly storm intensity and frequency  and temperature regimes  which may alter hydrologic  nutrient  and carbon export patterns in streams  riparian vegetation composition  and susceptibility of ecosystems to pests and disease  Climatic variations may also interact with other anthropomorphic disturbances  resulting in unexpected changes in ecosystem structure and function  For 20+ years we collected biological  chemical  and physical data using consistent methods to examine ecosystem responses in disturbed and undisturbed headwater streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina  USA  These datasets each designed to address unique questions regarding aquatic/terrestrial linkages  trophic interactions  and nutrient cycling in detrital based streams have provided a wealth of information that can be used to examine potential effects of climatic variability as well as interactions of disturbance and climate on small stream processes in forested watersheds  We used our long term datasets to examine relationships between organic matter standing crop and export  sediment export  invertebrate functional feeding group abundance  biomass  and annual production  and physical/climatic variables such as total degree days/max water temperature  mean/max discharge  number of winter and summer storms  and the Palmer Drought Severity Index Our long term datasets  1985 2006  for three streams included the wettest and driest years at Coweeta based on yearly departures from mean annual precipitation  63 year record   Fine particulate organic and inorganic matter export was positively related to annual precipitation and maximum discharge in undisturbed streams and streams without detrital inputs demonstrating that increases in storm frequency and intensity will lead to increased transport of sediments to downstream reaches  particularly those reaches without adequate riparian buffers  Functional feeding group invertebrate production over this time period was more strongly related to in stream standing crops of coarse particulate organic matter  basal food resources  than any of the climatic variables  Invertebrate production of most functional feeding groups was weakly related     to the number of summer storms each year  Additionally  large inputs of dead wood in the form of American chestnut and black locust trees killed by outbreaks of disease and pests between 1934 and the 1970s likely have altered stream processes over relatively short periods of time  Our long term data suggest that forested headwater streams may be more resistant to climatic changes such as altered hydrology and stream temperatures than changes in the quality and quantity of organic matter inputs from riparian habitats       
Historical demography along a climatic gradient  Generating predictions of population responses to climate change in the montane dioecious herb Valeriana edulis Climate change is unambiguously altering species traits and ecologies  However  there is a disjunction between retrospective studies  showing patterns of response to past climate change  and studies that manipulate climate to infer response to future change  While the former is ecologically realistic  it often lacks a clear demonstration of underlying mechanism  and while the latter provides mechanistic detail  such studies are usually simplified to manipulations of single climatic variables  Populations of the montane herb Valeriana edulis  Valerianaceae  vary in sex ratio both clinally over a climatic gradient  25% shift over 1800 m of elevation  and in response to the past 35 years of warming  pace of 20% shift by 2100   The similarities between these patterns    an increase in the relative abundance of males in warmer  drier conditions    suggest that they are likely underlain by parallel mechanisms  Using a space for time substitution and unpublished demographic data from the 1970  s  we sought to determine the mechanisms underlying this population sex ratio variation  We compared demographic processes among 4 populations varying in sex ratio by 15% along 700 m subset of the elevation gradient  With sex  and size specific vital rates  growth  survival  and reproduction  from each population  we constructed matrix population models  We then used sensitivity analyses and life table response experiments to ask  1  how do demographic statistics  population growth rate and equilibrium sex ratio  vary over the elevation gradient  2  which vital rates are responsible for these differences  3  to what degree is climate induced population change driven by uniform vs  sex specific responses  and 4  how will ongoing climate change affect the persistence and structure of these populations  We found clinal variation among the four populations in equilibrium sex ratio  but not population growth rate  While vital rates did not vary clinally  males and females consistently differed in these rates and the magnitude of this difference increased with elevation  For example  one important variable driving changes in equilibrium sex ratio was sexual dimorphism in survival rates  at low elevation males survived better than females  but this reversed at high elevation  Such variation within population and its consequence for among population variation in structure imply that similar mechanisms may underlie changes in sex ratio over time  Furthermore  identifying the mechanisms underlying population changes allows for the evaluation of management strategies to buffer the impact of climate change       
 Simulations of historic and future vegetation and fire dynamics in sub alpine Tasmania  Australia  using FireBGCv2  Insights from aligning simulation results with historical proxy records  Anthropogenic global change raises three major research questions about the influences of climate change and human land use and management on vegetation and fire regimes   1  How have humans and climate influenced historic fire regimes   2  How has recent climate change altered fire regimes   3  Can knowledge of historical controls over fire regimes inform and improve fire management  Comparisons across gradients of climate and human land use are central to answering these questions  Research is now underway to do so for the western United States and Cradle Mountain National Park  Tasmania  Australia  In these locations  we employ three different types of evidence  Sedimentary pollen and charcoal records allow us to reconstruct millennial scale fire and vegetation history at a coarse temporal grain  Tree ring records allow us to reconstruct fire and vegetation history at a finer temporal grain  FireBGCv2 simulations then allow us to project fire and vegetation dynamics under a variety of future scenarios  while the two bodies of historical evidence allow us to independently parameterize and validate FireBGCv2  Unifying proxy records of fire activity  contemporary observations  and future projections under a wide variety of climate and land use scenarios will further incorporate fire science into land use and management decisions Recent fieldwork at Cradle Mountain National Park in Tasmania  Australia  established 22 plots to assess current vegetation and fuel loads  Data from these plots allow us to apply FireBGCv2 to a unique study site that has had a greater human influence on fire regimes than comparison sites in the western United States  Our fieldwork identified 12 different plant community types  Analysis indicates substantial disagreement between our field data and the most widely used remotely sensed vegetation data  Parameterizing the dominant tree species    which are new to this modeling system    was a key challenge  An experimental design of five climate scenarios fully crossed with five management scenarios allows us to address our three major research questions consistently across gradients of historic climate and human land use in several FireBGCv2 study sites  For the study landscape in Tasmania  Australia  where competing hypotheses suggest different mechanisms of vegetation change  model results support an active human role in shaping vegetation across the landscape       
 Restoring riverine resilience  Using historical ecology to reconstruct eco geomorphic complexity on an intermittent river  lower Santa Clara River  Ventura County  CA 	  The maintenance and creation of resilience has been suggested as one of the most effective ways to manage ecosystems in the context of climate change  This is particularly true for extremely dynamic ecosystems such as Mediterranean climate rivers  which were naturally resilient to highly variable climatic and hydrologic conditions in the recent past  Research on riverine systems of coastal California has demonstrated that historical ecology can be a powerful tool for understanding the attributes that made ecosystems resilient to climatic variability in the recent past  suggesting potential future landscape trajectories  The lower Santa Clara River  Ventura County  California  is a flashy alluvial river that is the focus of ongoing conservation and restoration efforts  We designed a historical ecology study to provide context for these efforts by answering fundamental questions about the river  s history  such as the magnitude of floodplain reclamation  the extent of riparian forest  and the presence/absence of dry season flow  We integrated hundreds of historical cartographic  textual  and visual accounts to reconstruct ecological and hydrogeomorphic characteristics of the river prior to major modification  early 1800s   Data were collected from over 30 archives  assessed for accuracy and reliability  and synthesized into a GIS database of early conditions  Our reconstruction documented an extremely broad former river corridor that supported a diverse mosaic of riparian communities  from extensive willow cottonwood forests to xeric scrublands and including several large    100 ha   discontinuous nodes of forested wetlands  This reach scale ecological heterogeneity was linked to local variations in dry season water availability  with approximately 70% of the river sustaining summer surface water and the remainder going seasonally dry  Comparison to contemporary conditions indicates a loss of nearly half  49%  of the 19 th century river corridor extent  including a dramatic reduction in riparian habitat and floodplain area  though historical flow patterns have remained somewhat intact  These findings enrich our understanding of how the lower Santa Clara River provided reliable refuge and habitat for target species that persisted through major flood and drought events  This functional  spatially explicit approach helps identify opportunities for reestablishing similar attributes to enhance system resilience in the future  These findings suggest that different restoration strategies may be appropriate for different reaches  rather than a   one size fits all   approach  Far from being irrelevant  history is a valuable tool that can suggest new strategies and opportunities for designing resilient  climate adaptive systems in a time of global change       
Wild and wonderful West Virginia wetlands  First iteration of a plot based vegetation classification A statewide vegetation classification has the potential to positively impact biodiversity conservation and resource management  Plot based inventory work at the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources  WVDNR  and compilation of existing plot data from researchers outside the WVDNR has resulted in a georeferenced database of 4 220 vegetation plots  of which 1 650 are wetlands  Non parametric multivariate statistical techniques were used to classify the wetland dataset into associations at the standard of the National Vegetation Classification  Floristic data provide the basis of the analysis  and environmental variables are overlain to aid in describing the habitats of the floristic groups  The wetland classification for West Virginia represents a quantitative first iteration delineating the biodiversity of the state's major wetland systems  Associations range from the ancient marl fens of the Shenandoah Valley to the spruce bogs of the Allegheny summits and the pin oak swamps of the Ohio River floodplain  Environmental descriptors of each community type help to define the ecological niches occupied by present vegetation  and are designed to extend the usefulness of the classification as plant species respond individualistically to climate change  The classification brings significant new conservation opportunities through linkage to a new Outdoor Heritage Conservation Fund and a state map of   irreplaceable wetlands    The raw plot data feed into a newly designed database tool to guide restoration action on public and private lands  The plot data also continue to be useful in determining the distribution and abundance of plant species  and are a primary source for recent records of rare species tracked by the West Virginia Natural Heritage Program       
Developing vegetation classifications for federal lands in New York using analysis of plot data From 2000 through 2012 New York Natural Heritage Program ecologists sampled 1 020 vegetation plots on federally owned or administered lands in the state  RelevÈ sampling followed protocols developed under the USGS NPS Vegetation Mapping Program  The USGS NPS Vegetation Characterization Program is a cooperative effort by the U S  Geological Survey  USGS  and the National Park Service  NPS  to classify  describe  and map vegetation communities across the United States  Products meet Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for vegetation classification and metadata  and national standards for spatial accuracy and data transfer  We statistically analyzed and grouped these vegetation plots using Non metric Multidimensional Scaling  NMS   Cluster Analysis  CA   and Two Way Indicator Species Analysis  TWINSPAN  in PC ORD 5  NatureServe  an important partner in the USGS NPS Vegetation Characterization Program  is the steward of the National Vegetation Classification System  NVC   which is used by the program to classify vegetation communities  Each plot was classified to the Association level following the US NVC  For each federally owned or administered land parcel in New York we produced a detailed report with a complete classification and wall to wall GIS vegetation map as part of the USGS NPS Vegetation Mapping Program  The size of each federal parcel  number of plots sampled  number of US NVC Associations described  and final report year for each site were as follows  Fire Island National Seashore  1 649 ha  60 plots  25 associations  2002   Saratoga National Historical Park  1 376 ha  186 plots  54 associations  2008   Sagamore Hill National Historic Site  36 ha  16 plots  10 associations  2008   Gateway National Recreation Area  10 093 ha  178 plots  35 associations  2008   Home of Franklin D  Roosevelt National Historic Site  Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site  Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site  517 ha  147 plots  50 associations  2009   Upper Delaware Scenic    Recreational River  22 251 ha  227 plots  50 associations  2008   Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge  4 110 ha  72 plots  20 associations  2008   Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge  4 552 ha  90 plots  23 associations  2008   Appalachian National Scenic Trail  25 plots  in progress  Fort Drum Military Reservation  43 409 ha  19 plots  2013   Baseline information on plant community composition and rarity is critical to developing desired conditions and federal land management goals relating to native plant communities  nonnative plant and insect species  and effects of deer browse and other disturbances  The identification and description of plant communities also provide habitat information important to understanding associated organisms       
Twenty years of sampling and classifying vegetation in California About 20 years ago California state conservation agencies partnered with local NGO  s to develop a quantitative classification of the state  s vegetation  At that time a list of rare natural communities  within a general hierarchy framework had been developed along with quantitative pieces of a late seral forest classification  We assembled a preliminary semi quantitative state wide classification based on the early principles of the National Vegetation Classification System  NVC  in 1995  By prioritizing mapping and concomitant plot sampling and analysis of diverse landscapes across the state  the classification grew exponentially  We produced a substantially resolved second edition of the state classification in 2009  Four years later the state classification continues to develop and includes floristically defined and described classification units from all of the state  s major ecosystems  We are now arriving at an important second phase of the classification  refinement  This requires re visiting the assembled   pieces    recognizing likely gaps  and harmonizing the often overlapping concepts  which usually developed in spatial and temporal isolation  This phase requires analysis of thousands of plots  carefully selected to be geographically and ecologically representative of target vegetation  s full range of variability  It also needs to incorporate the maturing philosophy of the NVC Initial steps in the refinement include referencing and labeling a large percentage of the individual plots  selecting groups of related samples from multiple projects  and running multivariate analyses of the combined data sets  Results have been summarized and current concepts of NVC classification hierarchy and nomenclature applied for two California ecoregions  the warm desert  Mojave and Sonoran   and the Central Valley  The outcomes demonstrate a number of significant realizations  These include simplification of fragmented and poorly sampled types  broader understanding of concepts of ecological relationships  whether within or beyond ecoregional or state boundaries  and the value of minimum standards for plot data collection  geo referencing  and photo documentation       
Minnesota  s native plant community classification  From a set of vegetation plot data to a statewide classification Researchers with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources undertook a nearly decade long effort beginning in the mid 1990s to develop a new quantitative  statewide classification of native plant communities for Minnesota  The classification  which was designed specifically for use in biodiversity conservation and forest management  was developed using multiple numerical tools  including ordination  cluster analysis  and indicator species analysis  to guide classification of plant species data from 5 224 plots spanning most of the range of terrestrial and wetland vegetation in the state  Analyses of plant species data were supplemented with interpretation of soils data and other environmental data in defining and delineating classification entities  During its development  the plant community classification was integrated with Minnesota  s ecological land classification system  which provided a framework for regionalization of analytical datasets and helped to link physiographic information to floristic data Minnesota  s classification is hierarchical  with six levels  Among the upper levels is the Ecological System  which groups plant communities according to influence by major ecological processes such as flooding or fire  Ecological Systems are well suited for landscape scale biodiversity conservation and forest resource mapping and planning  Another important upper level  the Floristic Region  highlights geographic patterns of plant distribution that became apparent only after numerous rounds of analysis of plot data and development of lower levels of the classification  In some instances these patterns correlate strongly with paleo vegetation patterns  The lowest levels of the classification correlate with local gradients of moisture and nutrients for terrestrial communities and with water chemistry and water level fluctuations for wetland communities  these units are being widely applied to site scale conservation and management activities  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has developed a series of products for application of the classification  including field guides for identification and interpretation of plant communities and silvicultural interpretations centered around native plant communities  The classification has served as a tool for new avenues of communication among plant ecologists  foresters  and other resource scientists and has elicited new ways of thinking about vegetation in Minnesota and the factors that influence it       
Classifying lake plant communities  Challenges and approaches The structure and composition of plant communities vary geographically and within lakes in response to environmental conditions and human disturbance  Because aquatic plant surveys are traditionally conducted at the lake level  rather than community or stand level scale  aquatic communities are often neglected in regional vegetation classifications  Identifying and describing these communities may help resource managers select high quality sites for protection and manage others  We have analyzed Minnesota  s extensive lakewide plant datasets and described patterns in taxonomic richness and composition in relationship to water clarity  trophic status and alkalinity  However  site based data are needed to describe within lake community diversity  For Minnesota lakes  data are lacking because of the difficulties associated with collecting quantitative plant data in littoral areas  Basic questions such as appropriate plot size and measurable attributes have not been addressed  We initiated plot based vegetation sampling in Minnesota lakes to assess the feasibility of collecting quantitative estimates of plant community composition  Plots  measuring 250 square meters  were subjectively placed within vegetated areas of lakes  Thirty quadrats  one meter squared  were systematically placed in each plot  Surveyors recorded all plant taxa observed  water depth and substrate type  Estimates of plant density and cover were also attempted  Plot based sampling can provide a standardized method where multiple surveyors can quantitatively describe a lake plant community and assess potential changes in composition  Species area curves indicated that a 250 square meter plot was adequate to estimate taxonomic richness within diverse communities  Visual estimates of density and cover were not consistent among surveyors  However  surveyors could consistently collect information on species occurrence  presence within quadrat  with visual observation or with rakes in turbid water  Plot data collection has focused on plant communities of relatively undisturbed sites of clear  hard water lakes of north central Minnesota  Additional data from soft water and alkaline lakes are needed for a statewide lake plant community classification  Data from a gradient of sites  including impaired sites  are needed to identify indicator species and to describe the range of conditions within a plant community class       
The challenges and consequences of use of a large plot database to improve the USNVC classification of Pinus palustris savannas of the southeastern Coastal Plain In 2008 the US Federal Geographic Data Committee adopted new standards for the US National Vegetation Classification  NVC  that mandate the use of a peer review process for evaluating proposed changes plus the use of plot data for documentation of the recognized vegetation types  In cooperation with the ESA Vegetation Panel we developed a demonstration dataset and associated analysis for evaluating and documenting best practices for implementing the new standards  For this project we focused on the fire maintained longleaf pine   Pinus palustris   savannas of the southeastern Coastal Plain  This focal system provides unique challenges in that the floristic diversity of the region has led to recognition of over 130 longleaf dominated vegetation associations  despite the low topographic relief and consistent canopy dominance  We were particularly interested in the degree to which quantitative data would yield a classification consistent with the types previously described  and in developing best practices for validating and incorporating changes in the established classification We identified ~1100 vegetation plots from the Carolinas  Georgia and Florida containing ~1600 species and representing the range of compositional variation of longleaf pine vegetation in those states  We followed the protocol described by Peet and Roberts  2013  to homogenize the data  develop clusters consistent in compositional variation relative to other types in the NVC  assess indicator species  and propose appropriate changes in the NVC  We examined ~80 associations  vegetation types  and the total number recognized remained relatively constant  Of those associations ~25% remained unchanged and were for the first time quantitatively described  ~50% had complex relationships with one or more previously recognized associations  and ~25% were entirely new associations  The complex relationships between new and established associations need to be documented by set theory relationships of the sort used in the taxon concept schema of TDWG as otherwise updating datasets containing references to NVC associations becomes intractable  Despite having a large dataset spanning a large geographic region  we faced challenges related to the requirement that compositional variation of associations be described across the geographic range of those associations  The new NVC standards represent a major step forward  but actual implementation will be a challenging and slow process       
The influence of Minnesota's quantitative native plant community classification on the development of the U S  National Vegetation Classification The U S  National Vegetation Classification  USNVC  is a hierarchical classification of existing vegetation  NatureServe  the steward of the USNVC  used several different state ecological classifications to help describe and delineate vegetation communities across the Midwest  Minnesota's state native plant community classification was developed using extensive plot data within the state  which greatly enhanced the amount of data available to update and revise the USNVC types within Minnesota and across the region Using plot data associated with Minnesota's plant community classification  along with data from other states  Minnesota state and NatureServe regional ecologists increased the accuracy of described vegetation communities in the USNVC  In those cases where Minnesota's classification didn't directly inform the USNVC  ecologists linked the two classifications by crosswalking the units  Establishing a clear link between the USNVC and state classifications has been critical to expand vegetation classification work regionally and across the U S       
Compilation of a national plot database for the Canadian National Vegetation Classification and its contribution to the development of Ontario  s Ecological Land Classification treed vegetation types The Canadian National Vegetation Classification  CNVC  is being developed with ecological plot data obtained from each province and harmonized into a nationally standardized database comprising approximately 100 000 plots  These data are currently being analysed to develop a forest and woodland classification for Canada  in conjunction with provincial ecological classification programs  In Ontario  approximately 6000 plots for forest ecosystems are being analysed to develop a new generation of provincial vegetation types that comply with the emerging national classification standard of the CNVC and that also account for ecological relationships across jurisdictional boundaries with adjoining provinces Classification of boreal forests across Canada is nearing completion  and results from Ontario will be presented with potential applications within the provincial regulatory framework       
Working towards a distributed model of vegetation plot databases to support vegetation ecology in North America Recently  a team of international vegetation scientists have created a Global Index of Vegetation Databases  GIVD   Central to the goal of GIVD is to advance the sharing  archiving  and disseminating field plot data  the fundamental data required for describing and understanding vegetation types and explore their ecology  In the U S   a key contributor to this effort has been VegBank  a vegetation plot database of the Panel on Vegetation Classification of the Ecological Society of America  VegBank is a stand alone  Internet accessible  vegetation plot archive designed to allow users to easily submit  search  view  annotate  cite  and download diverse types of vegetation data  But  many state and federal agencies currently maintain their data in independent databases  Given the need for institutions and organizations to maintain their own plot data  vegetation ecologists are in need of methods to share data We explore the common data attributes needed to share vegetation data  and we summarize the opportunities to work towards a shared set of database attributes  We demonstrate the utility of the distributed data model using a study on a specific ecosystem       
Silvicultural interpretation of vegetation plot data Since the early 1900s foresters have used regional vegetation classifications as a tool for site classification  Habitat type  forest ecosystem  and native plant community classifications have been available to North American foresters for many years  but are rarely used to their full potential  This is so because the classifications by themselves do not directly address essential silvicultural concepts such as  natural disturbance regimes  successional models  tree longevity  seedbed requirements  recruitment windows  or the interaction of tree seedlings with the groundlayer  If a regional classification is to be used for forestry applications the plot data contributing to the classification must be re analyzed and interpreted for silvicultural purposes  Also  the classification must be tied to timber inventories for planning purposes before the classes will be used over cover type as the driver of decision making In Minnesota the plots contributing to the Native Plant Community  NPC  classification are a growing corpus of classified data  Other inventories such as Forest Inventory and Analysis plots  stand timber inventories  and Public Land Survey corners have been modeled as belonging to a particular NPC class  Partial species lists  whether just woody vegetation or some fraction of the vascular plant flora were passively associated with NPC classes  This greatly expanded the utility of the NPC classification and our ability to describe the   community silvics   of trees       
Vertebrate frugivore loss  High risk geographic areas and hypothesized community level impacts Animal mediated seed dispersal may enable seeds to escape from predators  parasites  and competitors  It can also boost germination by directing seeds to favorable germination sites and  for some species  removing germination inhibitors  A growing amount of empirical research has found quantifiable decreases in plant recruitment as a result of seed disperser losses  Such decreases have the potential to affect broad plant community dynamics  However  these community effects are little understood  Furthermore  the prevalence of seed dispersal disruption      its frequency of occurrence and the number of species affected  is unknown  I used a database of known vertebrate seed dispersers  in conjunction with published seed dispersal networks  to identify geographic areas at particular risk of seed dispersal disruption and to assess the proportion of angiosperms potentially affected in each region Predicted percentages of angiosperm species affected are particularly high in tropical and southern hemisphere regions  2 14%   as well as on oceanic islands  12%   In cases of seed dispersal disruption  hypothesized community level effects include reduced regional plant cover  reduced alpha scale plant diversity  and increased erosion and altered hydrology  These effects could facilitate invasion by wind dispersed non native species  Adequate testing and refinement of these hypotheses are hindered by the mathematical complexity of integrating multiple species with varied life histories  limited resources for long term empirical studies  and the long generation times that are typical of fleshy fruited plant species and create delayed community level responses to seed disperser losses  To better understand these relationships  it is critical that new experimental and theoretical methods be developed  Collaborations across both ecological subdisciplines and geographic regions may help elucidate complex patterns       
Size matters  Meta analysis of the effects of human disturbance on seed dispersal by animals Animal mediated seed dispersal is important for sustaining plant diversity in forest ecosystems  particularly in the tropics  Forest fragmentation  hunting  and selective logging modify forests in myriad ways and their effects on animal mediated seed dispersal have been examined in many case studies  However  the overall effects of different types of human disturbance on animal mediated seed dispersal are still unknown  We identified 35 articles that provided 83 comparisons of animal mediated seed dispersal between disturbed and undisturbed forests in tropical and subtropical ecosystems  We carried out a meta analysis to test whether forest fragmentation  hunting  and selective logging affected three components of animal mediated seed dispersal of fleshy fruited tree species  frugivore visitation rate  number of seeds removed  and distance of seed dispersal Forest fragmentation  hunting  and selective logging did not affect visitation rate and were marginally associated with a reduction in seed dispersal distance  Hunting and selective logging  but not forest fragmentation  were associated with a large reduction in the number of seeds removed  Fewer seeds of large seeded than of small seeded tree species were removed in hunted or selectively logged forests  A plausible explanation for the consistently negative effects of hunting and selective logging on large seeded plant species is that large frugivores are the first animals to be extirpated from hunted or logged forests  The reduction in forest area after fragmentation had weaker effects on frugivore communities and animal mediated seed dispersal than hunting and selective logging  We conclude that the disruption of plant frugivore interactions is likely to cause changes in tree species composition in disturbed tropical forests because large seeded plant species were more susceptible to direct human effects than small seeded plant species  This finding underscores the central role of vital plant  animal interactions for maintaining species rich tropical tree communities       
Does primate disappearnace influcence the advanced regeneration assemblage in rainforest fragments Primates represent important seed dispersers  especially of large seeded tree species  however  information on the impact these animals have on advanced regeneration in forest fragments remains obscure  We tested the hypothesis that forest regeneration is limited in fragments without primates  During 17 months we recorded species richness and density of all juvenile plants already established as advanced regeneration  woody plants 5  100 cm tall and    1 cm in basal diameter  in 3 forest fragments occupied  OF  by primates  3 fragments unoccupied  UF  by primates  and 3 areas of continuous forest  CF  in the Lacandona rainforest  Mexico  Plant species were classified as vertebrate dispersed  VD   primate dispersed  PD   and abiotically dispersed  AD   We assessed the influence of adult assemblages  primate presence  fragment attributes  size  age  distance to continuous forest   and canopy openness on advanced regeneration assemblages We registered 6 879 advanced regeneration plants  2087 in CF  1472 in OF  and 3320 in UF  belonging to 133 species  59 genera  37 families in 405 1 m 2 plots  Sixty nine % were VD species  20% were AD  and 11% were PD  Assemblage structure of adult trees and advanced regeneration plants differed among habitat types  depending on the seed dispersal mode  Abundance of advanced regeneration PD species showed a similar pattern to that found for adult trees  Density of adult trees and advanced regeneration plants in each dispersal mode differed between habitat types  Richness of adult trees and advanced regeneration plants in each dispersal mode also differed between habitat types  Considering all dispersal modes  richness of adult trees was higher in UF and CF than in OF  while richness of advanced regeneration plants was higher in UF than in CF and OF  Richness of PD adult trees was higher in CF than in OF and UF  but richness of PD advanced regeneration plants was similar among habitat types  Proportion of adult trees in each dispersal mode corresponded to the proportion of advanced regeneration plants found in each habitat type  Multiple correlation analysis showed the density of PD plants was highly correlated with adult tree density and to a lesser degree with habitat size  positively  and distance to continuous forest  negatively   None of the ecological variables measured influenced the richness of PD plants  We conclude that primate disappearance constrains the recruitment of large seeded species  because advanced regeneration assemblages were largely explained by adult tree composition  Nevertheless  we cannot reject the possibility that particular PD species may be affected by the disappearance of primates       
 Theory  Impact of disperser loss on forest communities  plant spatial patterns  and plant diversity  Forests are experiencing global declines in vertebrate abundances  many of which are important seed dispersers of plants  Declines in seed disperser abundances will reduce dispersal of vertebrate dispersed plants compared to abiotically dispersed plants with consequences for seedling spatial patterns and diversity  Seed dispersal establishes the spatial template that determines future local interactions  natural enemies alter this initial pattern  Seed dispersal is typically modeled as monotonically decreasing with distance from the tree  but vertebrates disperse seeds in clumps to areas they prefer  This clumped seed deposition alters plant interactions with natural enemies with consequences for plant diversity  Seedling patterns resulting from plant mortality due to specialized seed predators and pathogens are hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining plant diversity  I investigate the influence of seed dispersal by wind and vertebrates and patterns of plant mortality due to insects and pathogens on seedling spatial patterns and coexistence and examine how hunting modifies these patterns using spatially explicit stochastic models  Seedling recruitment patterns observed in the model reproduce the range of patterns observed empirically  I find that recruitment patterns and plant diversity are sensitive to the type of natural enemy attack  the dispersal mode  and the relative dispersal distances of seeds and natural enemies  Reducing dispersal distances of seeds increases seed mortality due to pathogens  and when seed dispersal distances are lower than insect dispersal  increases satiation of insect predators under low to intermediate insect fecundity  I discuss the importance of accurately describing seed dispersal and natural enemy movement and natural histories to improve our understanding of seedling distributions and diversity  A basic understanding of how animals and pathogens affect plant diversity is essential as seed dispersal  predation  and diseases are expected to change in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems  such as hunting       
An experimental test of gibbon and bird seed dispersal patterns	  Seed dispersal is essential for plant recruitment  Despite much attention to animals as seed dispersers  very few studies have been able to link spatial patterns of animal generated seed shadows to patterns of tree regeneration  We asked  How do species of seed dispersers differ in the seed shadows they create  and are those differences reflected in spatial patterns of tree regeneration  Focusing on a common forest tree   Microcos paniculata   in northeastern Cambodia  we quantified dispersal kernels created by the tree  s major dispersers    gibbons   Nomascus annamensis   and four species of bulbul  Pycnonotidae   We experimentally sowed 9360 Microcos seeds to match kernels created by those two groups of dispersers and a control  no dispersal   To determine if there were any differences in seed germination and seedling survival between the three types of kernels  we checked seed addition plots one  three  six and eleven months after sowing  After eleven months  0 3% of sown seeds in the gibbon dispersal kernel  0 9% of those in the bulbul kernel  and 1 4% of control seeds had germinated and were alive as seedlings  Preliminary analyses indicate higher mortality of seeds and seedlings at further distances from source trees  This pattern is the opposite of that predicted under the Janzen Connell hypothesis and observed in other systems  Our data suggest that habitat near adult Microcos trees is most suitable for seed germination and seedling survival  despite presumed density dependent mortality   We suggest that Microcos relies on seed dispersers to move seeds to novel areas and provide gene flow between sub populations rather than to avoid distance and density dependent mortality near parent trees       
The study of spatiotemporal ecological point processes Ecological spatial patterns are structured by a multiplicity of processes acting over a wide range of scales  The goal of spatial ecology is to disentangle the signature of processes that act at different and similar scales on observed spatial patterns  These processes may include dispersal  local interactions  conspecific and heterospecific   natural disturbances  habitat association and environmental filtering  To understand how some of these processes act on spatial patterns we need two fundamental tools  First we need to build spatial explicit models which are analytically tractable and able to reproduce expected patterns starting from basic ecological principles  Second we need robust statistics that can link the observed patterns to theoretical results   We derive exact and approximate analytical solutions for the second order structures and they dynamic under different individual based  spatially explicit models for sessile organisms  e g   plants  using moment equations  We consider single species and multispecies models with local interactions  dispersal limitations  and natural enemy  We link these theoretical results to estimates of second order structure using wavelet transform  The methods are demonstrated through numerical examples and case studies of several tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island  Panama where multitemporal censuses were available  We found that at small scales  2 30 m  most abundant species are less aggregated than less abundant  but at intermediate scales  30 100 m  most abundant species are more aggregated  The rate of dissipation of spatial structures was also strongly correlated with abundance and the ability to recruit in shade  with most abundant and shade tolerant being more spatial persistent       
Frugivore communities and seed rain in regenerating pastures in Costa Rica Early secondary succession on degraded  tropical pastures is limited in part by a lack of seed dispersal  Because most Neotropical tree seeds are dispersed by animals  a primary challenge for ecological restoration is to create conditions that attract vertebrate frugivores into degraded environments with few opportunities for food or cover  We used a novel restoration experiment replicated at 13 sites across an agricultural landscape  ~100 km 2   in southern Costa Rica to study the effects of local restoration interventions  landscape context  and their interaction on the abundance  diversity  and composition of birds  bats  and seed rain 3 8 years after site establishment  Restoration sites were established in 2004 2006  and each site contains three 50  times  50 m plots randomly assigned one of three treatments  not planted  control   86 seedlings of four species planted in patches  two each of 4  times  4  8  times  8  12  times  12 m  nucleation treatment   and 313 trees of the same species planted in rows throughout  plantation   Tree cover in landscapes surrounding restoration sites varies from 11 88% within a 500 m radius  We evaluated how local restoration treatments and landscape context interact to attract vertebrate frugivores into degraded areas Local restoration and landscape context interacted to predict bird community composition  Frugivore abundance was greatest in plantations regardless of landscape context   possibly a result of niche complementarity between frugivore communities in forested and agricultural landscapes  In contrast to birds  bat communities were less strongly related to local restoration strategy and landscape context    consistent with some other nocturnal animals  Seed rain abundance in restoration sites was dominated by wind dispersed individuals  Asteraceae  Heliocarpus    but most species were animal dispersed  and most animal dispersed seeds were small    1 cm diameter  Solanum  Cecropia  Miconia  Piper    Dispersal rates for small seeded species were similar across local restoration treatments  but compositional similarity to mature forest and dispersal events of larger seeds    1 cm diameter  were greater in plantations than in nucleation treatments or controls  Our results suggest that a complete lack of vertebrate frugivores is unlikely in our study system  even in the most degraded sites  Regenerating pastures with few vertebrate frugivores are likely to have reduced animal dispersed seed rain   particularly for large seeded tree species  Given projections for large scale forest recovery in post agricultural lands in Latin America  it seems likely that future forests will initially be dominated by wind dispersed and small animal dispersed seeds       
How might Pacific Island forests be affected by the loss of native seed dispersers and their replacement by novel species  As a result of human colonization of the Pacific Islands  most native seed dispersing animals have become rare or extinct  and a diverse array of alien animals has invaded and proliferated  Because seed dispersal plays a key role in forest community dynamics  this shift has the potential to significantly affect forest community composition  We expected that large seeded tree species would be disproportionately affected by the change in dispersers  because the loss of native animals was especially severe among the larger animals  and this loss was not offset by the introduction of large bodied aliens  We also expected that the introduction of novel functional groups of animals  especially rodents  would impose heavy mortality on poorly dispersed seeds  We combined observational  correlational  and experimental approaches to examine the roles of extinct pigeons and bats  and invasive pigeons and rats  as dispersers of large seeded rain forest trees in Tonga  We used observational and experimental approaches to examine the roles invasive passerines  pheasants  and rodents in Hawaiian dry  mesic  and rain forests lacking native dispersers   In Tonga  three large pigeons   Ducula spp   and one bat   Pteropus samoensis   have become extinct  leaving Pteropus tonganus as the only native animal capable of dispersing seeds    13 mm diameter  and it handled 97% of the dispersed seeds of the 13 large seeded species studied  A prehistorically introduced pigeon   D  pacifica   dispersed seeds up to 25 mm diameter  but did not disperse the largest seeded trees  Rats   R  rattus   R  exulans    were mainly seed predators  but dispersed some species  e g   Pandanus tectorius    In Hawaii  introduced passerines were effective dispersers for some small seeded trees  but ignored others  and did not disperse large seeds  Introduced kalij pheasants   Lophura leucomelanos   had highly variable effects on the seeds of the 29 species they consumed  0 38% survival   Rattus rattus dispersed some large seeded species  and species with seeds    1 2 mm diameter  internally   but were mainly seed predators  disproportionately affecting seeds that had not been dispersed away from parent trees  Overall  the risk of dispersal limitation is greatest for large seeded species  as is the risk of seed predation by introduced animals  Although introduced animals are sometimes effective seed dispersers  their patterns of seed deposition may differ significantly from those of natives       
Predators and dispersers  Rodents leave viable seed fragments of a threatened Atacama Desert plant in suitable sites for recruitment	  Seed predation and seed dispersal are important ecological processes with antagonistic effects on plant population dynamics  the former presumably limits plant establishment  whereas the latter increases it  In the southern edge of the Atacama Desert in Chile  Myrcianthes coquimbensis is an endangered  large seeded  vertebrate dispersed shrub that in the present day has no known dispersers  Native rodents  however  depredate seeds of this species and leave seed fragments in rocky habitats where this species generally recruits  Here  we evaluated whether seed predation by rodents can result in effective seed dispersal of M  coquimbensis   To test this hypothesis we conducted four experiments  First  we experimentally cut 50%  75% and 85% of the seeds   endosperm to determine if seed fragments could produce seedlings  Second  we captured and fed native rodents with M  coquimbensis seeds to examine how often they left seed fragments when feeding  Third  we collected and sowed seed fragments left by rodents after feeding to assess if  and how frequently these fragments produced seedlings  Finally  to determine if rodents leave seed fragments in suitable sites for recruitment  we evaluated germination rates in the rocky habitats where fragments are left  as well as in two other habitats   open ground and under adult conspecific shrubs shy     shy where seeds usually arrive  We found that the monoembryonic seeds of M  coquimbensis have the ability to develop seedlings after being cut and even after the removal of up to 85% of their storage tissue  Native rodents readily consumed the seeds and left seed fragments in more than 50% of the trials  When sowed in greenhouse conditions  the majority of seed fragments left by rodents produced seedlings  Finally  germination in rocky habitats was consistently higher than in open ground habitats  and higher one year   but not the next   than under adult conspecifics  Our results suggest that rodents may play a dual role in the recruitment dynamics of M  coquimbensis   serving simultaneously as seed predators and effective dispersers  Therefore  though seed predators impose costs  their net effect on plant fitness in this system   where dispersers of large seeded species have been lost   is not necessarily negative       
Case study  The impact of complete frugivore loss on the island of Guam All native vertebrate frugivores  mostly birds  were functionally extirpated from the island of Guam by the invasive Brown Treesnake   Boiga irregularis    Our research takes advantage of this unique mass extirpation by comparing Guam to three nearby islands that have relatively intact frugivore communities  We investigate how the loss of vertebrate frugivores affects plant recruitment on a population level  and then consider how these effects scale up to the forest community  In other systems  vertebrate frugivores have been shown to increase germination rates through handling  move seeds away from high mortality near the parent tree  move seeds to microsites suitable for germination  lay the template for the spatial pattern of trees  and assist in colonization of new areas  The loss of vertebrate frugivory thus is likely to have widespread effects on the populations of fleshy fruited tree species  We used nursery experiments to determine the effect of handling on germination and seed and seedling additions to assess whether survival is increased when seeds are moved away from the parent tree  We also compared the abundance of pioneer species that necessitate high light microsites  the spatial pattern of trees  and native seed rain into degraded areas between islands with and without vertebrate frugivores Vertebrate frugivore loss has led to widespread effects at the population level  and may be responsible for changes in the overall forest community  Ingestion by vertebrate frugivores doubled to quadrupled the chance of germination for both species we tested  In addition  seeds were dispersed significantly farther from the parent tree on islands with birds than on Guam  where seeds rarely landed beyond the canopy of the parent tree  Four out of five species of seedlings planted away from conspecifics experience higher survival  suggesting that disperser loss will have demographic effects  Pioneer species are significantly less abundant in the forests on Guam  although there are twice as many forest gaps present where pioneers could grow  There is some indication that spatial pattern of trees is starting to differ on Guam compared to Saipan  Tinian and Rota  Colonization of new habitat by native  fleshy fruited tree species is unlikely to occur on Guam due to complete cessation of avian seed dispersal  although non native pigs may be dispersing some species  Collectively  the impact of disperser loss on Guam is likely to produce major changes in the spatial pattern  abundance and diversity of trees within the forest  as well as changes in overall forest structure       
Deer and The Nature Conservancy  What organizations can do to limit impacts of deer on our forests	  While the benefits of forests    watershed protection  air purification  recreation  and climate regulation    are plentiful  these ecosystem services are not guaranteed forever  particularly when so many of our forests lack adequate regeneration  A primary factor limiting forest regeneration is deer browse  Study after study points to the impact of deer not only on forest regeneration but also on decreases in bird diversity  expansion of invasive plants and increases in the spread of Lyme disease  Despite these scientific findings  state agencies still largely set deer management objectives based upon hunter satisfaction relying little on the ecological data available to them  In an effort to change this  The Nature Conservancy of New York recently completed a forest regeneration study  see http //www nature org/nyforests   using data from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis  FIA  program and methods from an ongoing U S  Forest Service regeneration study in Pennsylvania  Seedling and sapling densities at 1 647 unique forested locations were rated on a scale  ranging from poor to very good  Regeneration status was assessed for two species groups   all native canopy trees and for a subset of commercially valuable timber species  We found that regeneration was poor in a 1/3 of the plots for canopy species and not sufficient in 57% of plots for economically important timber species  Canopy regeneration was poorest in the southeast portion of the state including Long Island  the southern Hudson Valley  and southern Catskills  Even in areas where regeneration was adequate  it was often dominated by low value timber species such as American beech and balsam fir  These results suggest that limited regeneration is a problem for forests in many areas and is of particular economic concern for timber species in over half of the state  We will summarize the results of this study as well as the broader impacts of deer across the eastern U S  The goal of this talk is to increase awareness on deer impacts and discuss how we may expand the number of ecological studies which are directly influencing deer management decisions at the state agency level       
Compounded disturbances in forest invasion  The importance of interactions between an exotic insect pest and deer herbivory	  Late successional forest communities of the eastern United States are believed to be highly resistant to invasion by exotic plant species  Intact forests dominated by eastern hemlock   Tsuga canadensis   once seemed to be good examples of this axiom  However  the integrity of many hemlock forests is currently threatened by a host of disturbances including the devastating impact of an introduced pest  the hemlock woolly adelgid   Adelges tsugae    Interactions of co occurring disturbances  including elevated white tailed deer   Odocoileus virginianus   populations  may strongly influence community and ecosystem response to hemlock mortality  These compounded perturbations may provide opportunities for the establishment of new plants in communities not prone to invasion  We used repeated censuses of exclosures and paired controls to investigate the role of a generalist herbivore  white tailed deer  in the invasion of exotic plant species in eastern hemlock forests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania that spanned a gradient in the severity of canopy disturbance caused by hemlock woolly adelgid  We used maximum likelihood estimation and information theoretics to quantify the strength of evidence for alternative models of the influence of canopy disturbance severity and its interaction with deer density on exotic plant abundance   Over the study period  the abundance of all three exotic plants increased significantly more in the control plots than in the paired exclosures  For all species  the inclusion of canopy disturbance parameters resulted in models with substantially greater support  These results suggest that hemlock woolly adelgid related canopy decline can accelerate the invasion of exotic plants and that white tailed deer herbivory can interact with canopy decline to magnify the observed impact  In addition  our results provide compelling evidence of nonlinear relationships between deer density and the impact of herbivory on exotic species abundance  These findings highlight the important role of herbivore density in determining impacts on plant abundance and provide evidence of the operation of multiple mechanisms in exotic plant invasion  Although many forest ecosystems are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of novel and simultaneous disturbances  ecologists do not understand the role of disturbances and their interactions in influencing community susceptibility to invasion  These compounded disturbances may have an impact greater than the sum of the individual events and have the potential to fundamentally alter ecosystems        
Deer and earthworms modify forest responses to climate change Global change agents  including rising temperatures  overabundant herbivores  and nonnative invasive species are altering ecosystem processes  structure  and composition  The presence and relative strengths of these agents will determine the pace and direction of ecosystem change  For example  warming temperatures are predicted to cause temperate tree species to expand north into boreal dominated forests  while browsing by white tailed deer may hinder the expansion of palatable temperate species  Changes in the soil environment  due to nonnative earthworms  may further change understory plant communities  resulting in novel  depauperate plant communities  In two separate studies using field data collected at 139 sites  we examined the influence of these global change agents on the understory of mixed temperate boreal forests across the upper Great Lakes region in central North America  Study results indicate that climate  deer  and earthworms have interrelated roles in northern forests  Growth rates of temperate and boreal saplings were influenced by summer temperature and deer browse pressure  The potential magnitude of growth reduction due to heavy browse pressure and limiting temperatures was similar  up to 50%  and the relative performance of competing species shifted depending on the levels of these drivers  Positive temperate sapling growth responses to temperature were eliminated by heavy browse pressure  tilting growth rates in favor of less palatable boreal conifers at all but the warmest sites  Evidence of nonnative earthworm presence and disturbance was found at 93% of our sites  Through structural equation modeling  we found that earthworm disturbance was positively related to precipitation and soil pH while deer density was correlated with temperature  Increasing earthworm disturbance and deer density were associated with simple understory plant communities dominated by graminoid cover  These open understory communities were in turn positively related to increased browse damage to maple   Acer spp   saplings  Earthworms and deer appear to be modifying forest responses to warming temperatures and hindering the expansion of some temperate tree species       
What twenty years of deer exclusion can do to an ecosystem Many regions of the USA are currently experiencing the effects of overabundant white tailed deer populations  Deer can have both direct and indirect effects on local ecosystems  impacting populations of other species  including trees  shrubs  forbs  birds  and invertebrates  Using deer exclosures set up over twenty years ago in three areas with different deer management practices  no deer hunting  doe hunting and buck only hunting   we investigated the effect of deer exclusion and management practice on the richness and abundance of saplings and forest floor invertebrates and on seed bank composition  The three different areas are located in Dutchess County  NY  Area one has had annual controlled hunts since 1976  Cary Institute   area two has not been hunted since the late 1960s  Rockefeller   and area three has buck only hunting  Mid County   All areas are comprised of 4 paired exclosed/unexclosed plots  All plots were sampled for sapling density/identification and invertebrate identification and enumeration and soil nutrients during summer 2012 The numbers of saplings across three size classes  0 5 1 0 m  1 0 1 5 m and 1 5 2 0 m  reflect a pattern of 'self thinning' at all three sites  with the smallest saplings having the greatest abundance and decreasing abundance in larger size classes  In addition  there are large differences between exclosed and unexclosed treatments for two of the deer management types  with a notable decline in abundance of saplings in the largest size class at the unexclosed plots at the Mid County  buck hunting   and an almost complete lack of the two larger size classes of saplings at the Rockefeller unexclosed plots  no deer hunting   Only the site with annual controlled hunts shows evidence for forest regeneration  The richness  total number of orders  of forest floor invertebrates was lowest at Rockefeller  and diversity  H'  was also significantly lower at the Rockefeller unexclosed plots  indicating that overabundant deer are having a significant impact on the diversity of forest floor invertebrates  In contrast  seed bank data indicate that deer are not having a significant impact on either species diversity or number of seeds present in the persistent seed bank  Together these results indicate that deer can have multiple effects on forested systems  from negligible to profound  How systems will ultimately function under increasing deer densities is not clear and worthy of further investigation  especially in urban systems where some functions may already be compromised       
Managing white tailed deer in an urban area  The consequences of responding to local impacts at a small liberal arts college The density of white tailed deer has been increasing throughout the United States due to declines in predation  changes in land use  and shifts in human/wildlife interactions  Unmanaged deer populations often become overabundant and negatively impact biodiversity and forest regeneration  Although deer management is critical to the stewardship of natural areas  management plans are often difficult and controversial to implement in urbanized areas  At Vassar College  we used research findings to develop a deer management plan for our ecological preserve  We used data from deer exclosures  both on site and locally   fecal pellet counts  and infrared flyovers to document the deer population and impacts at our site  Prior to the implementation of our management plan  we held a series of public forums and educational events to present the impacts we saw at our site  evaluate management methods  and to facilitate a discussion of suitable management methods  The college ultimately selected sharpshooting over bait as the method that accomplished our management goals safely while minimizing impacts to the local community  The implementation of our deer management plan provides a case study for the physical  legislative  and societal challenges of managing deer in developed areas Deer exclosure studies at our at our site showed greater plant diversity and sapling density in fenced areas than in adjacent unfenced areas  Our site had 98% fewer saplings than a nearby site with an active deer management plan  therefore reduction of our deer population was required to maintain ecological diversity at our site  We found that a lack of consistency and clarity in local and state regulations made planning and implementation of deer management difficult  We culled 64 deer in 2010 and 11 deer in 2013  We continue to monitor deer populations  assess deer impacts  and revisit available management options each year  updating our management strategy  Our findings indicate that even when strong evidence of deer impacts are presented and communicated to the public  some will disagree with the management decisions  Strong opponents to culling used legal action  harassment  misinformation campaigns  and threats in attempts to stop management even though scientific support for action was clear  Initial engagement of the community was valuable and encouraged citizens to think about their interactions with wildlife  However  consensus on highly controversial subjects seems highly unlikely due to differences in motive and worldview  It is unclear whether further outreach attempts would increase understanding or widen divisions within the community       
Why kill deer  Contraception and conflict in wildlife management When played out on urban and suburban landscapes  deer conflicts do not readily lend themselves to technical solutions  This is in part because existing technical solutions are weak or challenging to implement in these environments  but also because both the conflicts and possible solutions are grounded in deeper conflicts between value systems  In thinking about management of deer and other wildlife  it may be helpful to distinguish between material solutions that address overt problems  such as deer vehicle collisions  and cognitive solutions  which address hidden aspects of community discontent  Most discussions of deer conflict management focus around solutions to material problems  how can we reduce the number of deer vehicle collisions  prevent damage to ornamental plants  restore forest understory  or control Lyme disease  There are multiple approaches to mitigation  signage  fencing  creative planting  habitat modification  and appropriate changes in personal behavior all can effectively address material problems  However  these solutions are often the last to be implemented  if they are implemented at all  I would argue that mitigation strategies are pursued only reluctantly because they do not address the underlying cognitive conflicts  which rest on questions of how we should feel and think about deer and other wildlife living in our communities  Where cognitive conflicts are engaged is on the battleground of deer population control  should we control deer populations  and if so  how  Public hunting  professional culling  surgical sterilization  reversible contraception  and no action each serve as policy surrogates for strongly held and mutually antagonistic value systems    Injectable immunocontraceptives such as the porcine zona pellucida  PZP  vaccine have been studied in female white tailed deer for more than two decades  PZP can be delivered remotely  by dart  has no demonstrated harmful side effects  is safe to give to pregnant animals  does not pass through the food chain  and if administered appropriately can be 90 95% effective  Deer population stabilization and reduction has been demonstrated using PZP at three field sites  two of which  the National Institute of Standards and Technology  MD  and Fripp Island  SC  I will describe here  In spite of these successes  political resistance to deer immunocontraception remains stiff  and disproportionate to the  real  but diminishing  material obstacles still facing management application of the technology  This resistance suggests that  although popular among suburbanites  the concept of reversible contraception clashes with value systems held by important management stakeholders  including conservationists  The values underlying wildlife contraception must be rethought       
Understanding suburbia's opposition to lethal control of wildlife Since the publication of Peter Singer  s  Animal Liberation   wildlife managers have been under increasing scrutiny by individuals and groups opposed to the use of lethal control of wildlife  Ecologists  wildlife managers  and other scientists have been puzzled as to why the public would claim to support bio diversity on the one hand  but simultaneously oppose management strategies to preserve or enhance that biodiversity The dispute over the validity of lethal control for wildlife management is simply the result of the clash of world views  Scientists must understand that their view of humanity  s place in the ecosystem is often fundamentally different from the view of the various stakeholders claiming an interest in the management of nature  This presentation will highlight the philosophical  religious  sociological  and cultural influences that inform a suburbanite  s worldview regarding humanity  s role in the environment  In addition  it will provide some insights as well as tactics scientists should employ in their response to the animal rights ideology that informs suburbanite opposition to lethal techniques       
Great Lakes forest restoration through gray wolf recolonization	  People have eliminated top predators from much of the world  s habitats over the last century  In the absence of predators  ungulates became overabundant in many temperate and boreal forests  Through intensified and selective herbivory on saplings  these large herbivores are now altering forest community structure and inhibiting tree regeneration  If re introducing top predators can reduce herbivore numbers and/or alter their foraging behavior  then predator reintroduction may benefit plant growth as herbivory pressure is reduced  and a trophic cascade emerges  My research focuses on whether recently re established gray wolves   Canis lupus   may be generating such a trophic cascade in a Great Lakes forest by reducing white tailed deer   Odocoileus virgnianus   herbivory on saplings  I have constructed deer exclosures located throughout the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center  Land O   Lakes  WI  northern mesic forest  These exclosures are located evenly among areas of high  6  and low  6  wolf use so that I can quantify the impacts of deer herbivory at these sites and examine how they vary in relation to wolf predation risk  I also placed camera traps on the exclosure control plots to directly record differences in deer behavior between high and low wolf use areas  Results suggest wolves benefit regeneration of the dominant maples   Acer spp   by altering deer herbivory  Deer were observed less frequently on high wolf use plots than low wolf use plots in 2012  t test  p = 0 04   and deer in high wolf use areas switched from foraging focused behavior to a vigilance focused strategy  t test  p = 0 03   Therefore  deer browse pressure  maple browse index  was substantially reduced in high wolf use areas  t test  p    0 01   As a result  the impacts of deer on maple sapling growth were significantly affected by a wolf*year interaction  ANOVA  p = 0 01   with the predicted negative impacts of deer seen in low wolf use areas  post hoc ANOVA  p = 0 03  disappearing in high wolf use areas  post hoc ANOVA  p = 0 14   Maples in high wolf use controls were averaging well over twice the height of their low wolf use counterparts by 2012  post hoc t test  p    0 01   These results taken together suggest reintroduced predators can generate strong trophic cascades by altering the density and behavior of their prey  allowing saplings to grow and enter the forest canopy  Wolf reintroductions may thus represent a useful management tool for restoring forests damaged by overabundant ungulates       
Herbivory by mule deer and cattle suppress aspen basal shoot height  threatening aspen stand resilience across three National Forests High ungulate densities in forest ecosystems alter tree species composition which leads to drastic changes in plant and animal communities  In many regions with aspen forests  wildlife management policies  and extirpation of natural predators have promoted historically high ungulate densities and aspen is considered preferred browse species of elk  deer  and important forage for cattle  While herbivory is recognized as a factor in the degradation of aspen stands  the differential and interactive effects of herbivory on aspen regeneration are unstudied  Further  evaluating whether tree species composition and topographical features such as elevation  slope  and aspect at a stand predict successful aspen regeneration would improve management of aspen forests  The objective of this study is to characterize the impact of herbivory across broad geographical ranges and track aspen regeneration and recruitment as a function of ungulate density  stand type  and topographical features  We address the following questions  Does the density of ungulates have a direct effect on the regeneration of aspen  Does aspen regeneration differ based on stand tree species composition  Does herbivory by elk  deer  and cow differ in their impact on aspen regeneration  Do topographical features predict the success of aspen regeneration We selected 186 sites across the Dixie  Manti La Sal  and Fishlake National Forests in Utah  and characterized the following  overstory composition  ungulate density  and aspen regeneration  Using GIS  we extracted topographical features at each site from digital elevation models  We evaluated aspen basal shoot height and density using AIC model selection as a function of stand type  ungulate density  slope  elevation and aspect  Preliminary results show that high deer densities correlate to slightly increased aspen densities and strongly drive decreased aspen height  while cattle have slight impacts on decreases of both density and height  Surprisingly  elk  which are often blamed for aspen stand degradation in Utah  were not part of our top models and their density was not correlated with aspen density or height  High elevations  3000m 3200m   southern aspects and steep slopes    30%  were correlated with high aspen basal shoot density  In conclusion  we identify possible refuge areas at high elevation  steeps slopes and southern aspects  and find that both deer and cattle adversely affect the success of aspen regeneration  Our study could inform current management strategies by accounting for topographical features and the differential effects of ungulate species       
Conditional migration and foraging patch selection by a generalist herbivore results in a spatial resource subsidy in relict eastern hemlock forest Ungulates interact with ecosystem processes through a number of direct and indirect mechanisms  across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales  In forested ecosystems  ungulates may affect nitrogen availability directly through nitrogenous waste deposition and indirectly via selective herbivory  The former mechanism tends to increase available nitrogen  whereas the latter mechanism results in a decrease if ungulates are selecting nitrogen rich vegetation  Isolating these mechanisms is challenging  and most work thus far has focused on indirect consumptive effects  We draw upon two long term ungulate habitat monitoring studies paired with exclosure experiments to address the hypothesis that forest ungulates can directly increase nitrogen availability  In one study  white tailed deer   Odocoileus virginianus   habitat use was monitored through annual fecal pellet counts for eight consecutive years in 39 eastern hemlock   Tsuga canadensis   stands across the western upper peninsula of Michigan  Fecal pellets were collected and analyzed for nitrogen content to develop allometric relationships between pellet abundance and nitrogenous waste deposition  In the second study  deer use of twelve canopy gaps was assessed in 2007 and 2011  Each study contains a subset of deer exclosures  We compare the findings of each study to explore potential contingencies for forest ungulate impacts on nitrogen availability In the eight year  39 site study  estimated deer excreted nitrogen deposition often approached and occasionally exceeded that of atmospheric deposition at the site level  up to 12 3 kg N ha  1    Within site deer use patterns were clumped in space and time  suggesting that repeated deer use results in concentrated hotspots of nitrogen availability  In the canopy gap study  greater nitrogen availability was observed in deer access plots compared to exclosure plots within the same gap  While deer use was highest in small gaps  the greatest differences between exclosures and controls were observed in large gaps shortly after snowmelt  This is likely the result of a greater initial draw down of available nitrogen in small gaps by more proximate overstory trees  Additionally  warmer conditions in large gaps relative to small gaps early in the growing season may enhance mineralization rates  By May no difference was observed between exclosures and controls suggesting concentrated winter/dormant season use is likely driving ungulate related nitrogen availability in these openings  In summary  these studies suggest that forest ungulates may increase nitrogen availability via nitrogenous waste deposition  but the effect is contingent upon spatial scale  the seasonal timing of deposition  and habitat type       
The metacommunity concept as a framework for predicting patterns of diversity and stability in fragmented freshwater landscapes The metacommunity concept has emerged as a powerful framework to describe and forecast effects of community connectivity on species richness across multiple spatial scales  Although metacommunity theory can predict patterns of diversity at hierarchical scales in freshwater ecosystems  its potential contribution to understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation remains largely unaddressed  Several physical and ecological attributes of fragmented landscapes reflect metacommunity structure  including  1  habitat patches that vary in their degree of isolation from similar patches in the landscape  and thus regulate the amount of species dispersal among communities  and 2  food web structure that often differs among habitat patches  where top predators may be absent due to landscape connectivity  movement behavior  or a small patch size  Metacommunity theory suggests that differential dispersal rates and local food web structure are likely to affect species richness and stability at multiple scales  To evaluate the combined effect of dispersal and food web structure on species richness  and population  community and ecosystem stability  we constructed mesocosm metacommunities consisting of three pond communities with heterogeneous levels of fish predation and different planktonic dispersal rates  0  0 7%/d  20%/d   Two of the three communities differed continually in the occurrence of fish and supported different but constant environments reflecting spatially variable food web structure in a fragmented landscape  while the third community supported temporally variable fish occurrence reflecting a mobile top predator or one undergoing colonization extinction dynamics Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of zooplankton species in metacommunities  The unimodal dispersal diversity relationship was predation dependent  however  as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal  Additionally  spatially and temporally heterogeneous predation prevented spatial synchrony among prey populations despite the level of dispersal  whereas spatial synchrony of non prey species responded positively to dispersal rate  At the local scale  predation disrupted the synchronous dynamics between species produced by dispersal  In contrast to these effects of predation on population and community stability  ecosystem stability responded only to dispersal  where the low dispersal rate stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity in metacommunities  These results suggest that dispersal rates can moderate species diversity and ecosystem stability in metacommunities  but that selective top predators can yield predation dependent dispersal diversity relationships and stabilize dispersal induced population and community oscillations  Taken together  the results suggest a critical level of community connectivity may be required for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in fragmented freshwater landscapes       
 Bacterial community succession in leaves of the Northern pitcher plant  Sarracenia purpurea  One of the oldest questions in community ecology is what determines the assembly of communities in nature  In the broadest of terms  two main types of theories have been proposed  Community assembly can be driven by niche based mechanisms  commonly referred to as habitat filtering and competitive exclusion  In contrast  neutral community assembly models assume that all species in a community are equivalent in terms of their dispersal and competitive abilities  and their requirements  The composition of the community is therefore a stochastic process    individuals that are dying are randomly replaced by immigrants or reproducing individuals from within the community  We hypothesized that natural bacterial assemblages in small patchy aquatic habitats assemble following a neutral model  An ideal system  in which we can study bacterial community assembly is presented within the pitchers of the northern pitcher plant  Sarracenia purpurea   Ten newly opened S  purpurea pitchers were marked in June  2012  Changes in the bacterial community were then monitored for 2 months using two culture independent molecular techniques  PCR DGGE  generates a presence absence fingerprint of the dominant bacterial species in a sample  and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene  provides phylogenetic information on the dominant bacterial species present in a sample  Immediately upon opening  the pitchers of S  purpurea were found to be sterile  no bacterial DNA could be detected using conventional techniques   Within 48 hours  the pitchers were colonized by diverse bacterial communities  dominated by members of the Proteobacteria  At this early stage  individual pitchers contained a mixture of common  found in all pitchers  and unique bacterial phylotypes  bands on DGGE fingerprints   As time progressed  the bacterial assemblages of indiviual pitchers became increasingly different  At the final sampling time  2 months  there were very few bacterial phylotypes that were shared between all pitchers    10%  and individual pitchers appeared to contain random bacterial assemblages  We would expect significant similarities between pitcher bacterial communities  if their composition was largely determined by niche related processes  Our data is therefore consistent with a model of neutral assembly of bacterial species in the pitchers of S  purpurea        
Resource dependent dispersal promotes spatial food web persistence in a rock pool metacommunity In fragmented landscapes  the dispersal of individuals among local habitat patches connects isolated populations and food webs at a larger  regional spatial scale  often with important dynamical consequences   e g    spatial synchrony   As we know from optimal foraging theory  however  many mobile organisms do not disperse randomly among patches  but move in response to the availability of local food resources  which they also directly affect via consumption  As a result  dispersal may both influence and be influenced by local food web dynamics  creating a feedback across spatial scales  This local regional feedback has been theorized to permit locally unstable trophic interactions to persist regionally  as long as within patch dynamics are not synchronized across space  but to date has received little empirical attention  Here  I combine observational  experimental  and theoretical approaches to explore this local regional feedback and its dynamical consequences in a system of freshwater rock pools on Appledore Island  Maine  The pools contain a relatively simple food web dominated by a tri trophic food chain of Chlorophyte algae  zooplankton grazers  primarily Moina macrocopa    and a predatory insect   Trichocorixa verticalis   Lab and mesocosm experiments demonstrate that Trichocorixa is indeed a highly voracious apex predator that can strongly reduce local Moina densities  This predation may be high enough to drive local Moina populations extinct  particularly when Trichocorixa populations are primarily comprised of adults  the most voracious life history stage   However  Trichocorixa adults are also capable of flying among pools  and a mesocosm experiment shows that their emigration rates decrease as a function of Moina densities        negative resource density dependent dispersal or NRDD dispersal  as predicted by optimal foraging theory   I used a Monte Carlo modeling approach to combine the predation and emigration data sets  and show that Trichocorixa   s NRDD dispersal may contribute to the spatial persistence of Moina by creating temporary refuges from predation where prey densities are low  effectively converting a local Type II functional response into a regional Type III functional response   These dynamics appear to occur in the field  as shown using observational data from three pools  where the apparent emigration of adult Trichocorixa prevented the extinction of local Moina populations by relaxing predation pressure  Taken together  these studies suggest that the dynamics and persistence of food webs in spatially fragmented landscapes are driven by a feedback between local trophic interactions and regional dispersal       
Spatial synchrony and persistence in fragmented landscapes  Models and experiments Most species in nature comprise populations and subpopulations that are spatially subdivided to at least some degree  The overall effect of such subdivision on global extinction risk is challenging to predict  because it reflects the net outcome of numerous countervailing factors  Smaller populations are at greater extinction risk due to demographic stochasticity  but the more independent populations there are  the lower the global extinction risk  Dispersal can lead to re establishment of previously extinct populations and rescue populations that would otherwise go extinct  But dispersal also is thought to synchronize the fluctuations of different populations  thereby reducing the effective number of independent populations and increasing global extinction risk  While numerous experimental studies manipulate factors such as population size  number of populations  and dispersal rate and examine effects on local and global extinction risk  few attempt direct quantification and testing of the mechanisms linking these factors to extinction  We have been using stochastic predator prey models and experiments in a tractable model system  laboratory microcosms of protists  to quantify the mechanisms driving spatial synchrony and extinction risk  I will review our previous work  show some new results  and place our work in the context of other studies in both artificial and natural systems Results of our experimental work support several theoretical predictions  Dispersal only synchronizes cycling populations  It does so by forcing the populations to cycle in phase  a phenomenon known as phase locking  Dispersal cannot synchronize non cyclic population fluctuations arising from demographic and environmental stochasticity  Since most natural populations do not cycle  the implication is that dispersal induced synchrony  and the associated increase in global extinction risk  may not be a major concern in most natural systems  However  local and global extinction risk in our system appear to be largely independent of dispersal rate or spatial synchrony  Similarly  in nature spatially synchronized cycles often persist for extremely long periods  suggesting that synchrony induced increases in global extinction risk are of minor importance even in cycling systems  A better understanding of the links between synchrony  local extinction risk  and global extinction risk requires quantification of the rate at which dispersal re establishes synchrony in the face of desynchronizing demographic stochasticity and other spatially localized perturbations  In our experiments  higher rates of dispersal lead to more rapid establishment of phase locking  within as little as 1 5 cycle periods from an initially anti synchronous state   but the relationship between dispersal rate and realized levels of synchrony is nonlinear       
Evaluating the utility of a plant based index of lake condition using neural networks	  Aquatic macrophytes are an undervalued but critically important component of Minnesota  s lakes  Recent development of a multimetric macrophyte index  MMI  suggests that aquatic plants are useful indicators of lake condition  A quantitative evaluation of the MMI to determine whether the index can explicitly link lake condition with activities that negatively impact lake resources has not been conducted  Additionally  the statistical properties of multimetric indices may confound the interpretation of index response to changes in aquatic habitat condition  A greater understanding of index performance is necessary before it can be used to accurately and precisely evaluate lake health  Analytical approaches using ecological informatics could provide a powerful technique to evaluate the MMI  Supervised neural network models may be particularly useful given the ability to characterize multivariate response and relaxation of assumptions necessary for more conventional modeling techniques  The objective of this study was to develop supervised neural networks to quantify MMI response to environmental variables related to lake condition  These models were expected to illustrate key predictors of MMI performance with implications for lake management  Additionally  we hypothesized that neural networks could provide a general technique to evaluate multimetric index performance in other systems or regions  Neural networks made precise predictions of overall MMI scores using an independent dataset   R 2 fit between observed and predicted scores was 0 61   Predictive performance of the neural network models varied for individual metrics   R 2 from 0 12    0 68   Bootstrap analyses to evaluate the effects of different training data on model performance indicated that predictions were highly sensitive to the training data  However  consistent relationships were observed between specific metrics and explanatory variables  such as maximum depth of plant growth with trophic state  Metrics that were consistently related to specific explanatory variables were further evaluated to quantify relationships in the context of other explanatory variables  Overall  the neural networks did not identify the specific relationships between the explanatory variables and metrics of the MMI  although some consistent relationships were identified  More conventional modeling techniques had similar performance in predicting MMI and metric response  suggesting the MMI inherently confounds relationships among variables  rather than an inability of neural networks to characterize variable importance  These results suggest that the statistical properties of multimetric indices should be carefully evaluated during index development  with specific attention given to the sensitivity and unique diagnostic capabilities of individual metrics       
Integrating space into biodiversity and ecosystem function studies  Spatial averaging vs  spatial dynamics in aquatic microcosms Studies of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have proliferated in the last 20 years  However  studies of how spatial structure alters biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are few in number  Loreau  Mouquet and Gonzalez in a 2003 paper proposed the idea of spatial insurance that could help stabilize biodiversity  and noted the important distinction between the effects of simple spatial averaging and systems where there was a compensatory spatial dynamic that maintained biodiversity  A published laboratory microcosm study on protists and algae in aquatic microcosms tested the effects of dispersal and habitat  spatial  heterogeneity across patches on biodiversity  Here we used this experiment to test the effects of changes in biodiversity on 14 different ecosystem functions  Tests examined how ecosystem functions were altered by dispersal treatments and manipulation of resources available in different patches  spatial habitat heterogeneity  Changes in species composition were marked among different treatments  especially when the types of resources available to aquatic communities were altered  One resource type  decaying wheat seeds  produced phosphorous enrichment that led to increased algal abundance  increased photosynthesis and consequently to decreased carbon dioxide levels and increased dissolved oxygen levels in daylight conditions  The other resource type  leaf litter  produced more of a detrital community  dominated by bacterivores  Trophic structure also varied among the resource types  Of the 14 ecosystem functions several showed simple spatial averaging across habitat patches that led to an average level of functioning  However  productivity and decomposition both showed dynamics that could not be explained by spatial averaging  and likely indicate the involvement of a spatial dynamic such as mass effects  The results challenge us to identify factors behind such differences among different ecosystem functions and the characteristics of the species or functional groups that are responsible for producing spatial insurance of ecosystem functions       
Community trajectories in fragmented arid land streams  Combined effects of extreme environmental conditions and aerial dispersal Ecological theory predicts that species composition in fragmented communities may become more similar  convergent  or more distinct  divergent  through time  Fragmented communities may converge in composition due strong reductions in the overall number of species  loss of keystone species that facilitate persistence of weak competitors  or high levels of dispersal between fragments  among other drivers  On the other hand  fragments may diverge in composition due to stochastic loss of functionally equivalent species  low among fragment migration rates  or high variability in environmental conditions among fragments  Elucidating the mechanisms behind community convergence or divergence is of imminent conservation concern in arid land stream habitats  Climate change and anthropogenic water withdrawals are causing once contiguous arid land streams to fragment  resulting in unprecedented isolation of aquatic communities and deterioration of abiotic conditions  In such streams  extreme abiotic conditions and aerial dispersal are two important drivers of local community structure  but it is unknown how these factors interact to impact community structure in stream fragments  We combined data from several independent studies of aquatic invertebrate community structure in fragmented streams in southeastern Arizona to measure trajectories of community convergence or divergence and examined how aerial dispersal and abiotic conditions were associated with these trajectories In observational and manipulative studies conducted over three years  we sampled aquatic invertebrate community structure at the beginning and end of the harsh dry season  quantified aerial dispersal  and measured environmental variables  While aquatic invertebrate communities exhibited great interannual variability among the four studies  several consistent patterns emerged  We found that extreme environmental conditions were associated with community convergence through time as vulnerable taxa were eliminated and replaced by a small subset of tolerant taxa  When aerial dispersal rates were high  however  we observed divergence of taxonomic composition through time  We expected similar patterns in trait diversity but instead found that both extreme environmental conditions and aerial dispersal led to convergence in trophic trait composition  This trophic trait convergence was mainly due to the prevalence of large predators amongst the aerially dispersing taxa  Given predicted increases in both abiotic extremes and rates of large predator extinctions in arid land ecosystems  our research suggests increased community homogenization in arid land streams in the near future  We believe that aerial dispersal may be a mechanism to maintain diversity in these imperiled habitats and should be considered in future biodiversity conservation initiatives       
Trade offs and dispersal in unpredictable environments  Generalist invertebrate persistence across spatially and temporally fragmented pond Variable hydrology in lentic habitats poses a variety of life history challenges for generalist species that persist and disperse across this range of habitats  Invertebrates in temporary habitats must develop quickly and disperse as adults  or have wide environmental tolerances  Conversely  in permanent habitats they must avoid a suite of vertebrate and invertebrate predators  e g   fish and dragonflies   These diverse conditions result in life history trade offs that influence fitness  population dynamics and genetic structure  In addition  recruitment between habitats may be crucial to maintain generalist populations  This is particularly important under temporal fragmentation that results from unpredictable drying in temporary habitats and requires subsequent recolonization from permanent habitats  These metapopulation dynamics sustain regional populations  but may cause population bottlenecks during dry years when temporary habitat larvae are unable to complete development and do not contribute to regional gene pools  We examined Xanthocnemis damselfly and Sigara waterboatman populations in New Zealand lakes and irregularly drying ponds through field surveys  mesocosm experiments and microsatellite analyses to test whether   1  generalists have flexible developmental and behavioral traits to survive different habitat conditions  and 2  terrestrially dispersing generalists have bet hedging behaviors and oviposit in both habitat types to maximize reproductive potential Both species developed faster in temporary habitats  and were more susceptible to fish than dragonfly predation  However  they used alternative life history strategies to exploit habitats across the predator permanence gradient  Xanthocnemis had longer development time and were consequently exposed to more biotic and abiotic stressors  This exposure was offset by behavioral flexibilities which enhanced predator avoidance in natal habitats and increased drying tolerance  In contrast  Sigara 's rapid life cycle enabled them to exploit more temporary habitats  but they had little behavioral or developmental variation when exposed to predators and were intolerant of drying  Rapid adult colonization and oviposition by both species in temporary habitats was consistent with bet hedging supporting our second hypothesis  Overall  our results indicate that although generalists have different life history strategies  dispersal is critical to the maintenance of generalist populations across habitats with unpredictable disturbance regimes  While dispersal and life history flexibilities allow generalists to exploit unpredictable habitats  our analysis of microsatellites indicates irregular disturbance of these habitats results in bottlenecks that probably limit genetic variation and speciation  Such knowledge of mechanisms allowing generalist species to persist across spatially and temporally fragmented habitats is important for understanding for how species may respond to further unpredictable habitat fragmentation due to altered hydrology under climate change       
Predator induced dispersal can create indirect linkages between habitat patches with different top predator communities Dispersal is a central process determining community structure in heterogeneous landscapes  and species interactions within habitats can be an important determinant of dispersal  Although the effects of species interactions on dispersal within habitats have been well studied  how species interactions affect the movement of individuals between habitats in a landscape has remained understudied  These movements  however  have the potential to generate indirect connections between habitats that vary in their predator composition and to shape patterns of regional connectivity  Predator induced dispersal is therefore a question of central interest in understanding landscape connectivity  We used mesocosm experiments to examine the extent to which predation risk affects dispersal by a flight capable semi aquatic insect   Notonecta undulata    Exposure to non lethal  caged  fish that were fed conspecific notonectids  increased dispersal rates in N  undulata   Moreover  dispersal rate was positively correlated with the level of risk imposed by the fish  the greater the number of notonectids consumed by the caged fish the greater the dispersal rate from the habitat  These results indicate that risk within a habitat can affect the behavioral decision to disperse out of that habitat  Our results suggest that prey can exhibit finely tuned behavioral responses to predation risk that can shape patterns of landscape connectivity  This behavior creates indirect interactions between habitat patches that differ in their predator communities  Our findings suggest that prey behavioral responses to predators have the potential to affect community structure on a much larger spatial scale than the direct effect of predation itself       
Metacommunity size and functional diversity in a natural mesocosm landscape Ecosystems are often arranged in naturally patchy landscapes with habitat patches linked by dispersal of species in a metacommunity  The size of a metacommunity  or number of patches  is predicted to influence community dynamics and therefore the structure and function of local communities  For example  species richness and evenness are expected to decrease with number of patches in a metacommunity while stochastic processes will increase  However  such predictions have yet to be experimentally tested using full food webs in natural metacommunities  We used the natural mesocosm system of aquatic macroinvertebrates in bromeliad phytotelmata to test the effect of the number of patches in a metacommunity on species richness  abundance  and community composition in a long term enclosure experiment We found that species richness  abundance  and biomass were lower in enclosures compared to surrounding unenclosed bromeliads  but did not differ between enclosed metacommunities of differing patch numbers  Species diversity and evenness  however  significantly increased with increasing metacommunity size  with the smallest metacommunities showing greater stochasticity in community structure  Community composition was affected by metacommunity size with a greater predator to prey ratio in smaller metacommunities  and a more even detritivore community in larger metacommunities  Species specific effects were predictable based on species traits  Our study is the first test of metacommunity size in a natural metacommunity landscape and shows that both diversity and community composition are significantly affected by metacommunity size  This study opens the door for more explicit tests of the mechanisms driving community change and ecosystem function in fragmented metacommunities       
Plant hydraulic controls over the susceptibility of trees to mortality following climate enhanced disturbances Climate enhanced disturbances to forests  including drought and insect induced mortality  are increasing globally  The bark beetle epidemic spanning western North America has affected multiple species of conifers  with or without co occurring drought  Recent modeling efforts implicate both hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes in tree death  but the role of combined effects of drought and insect induced mortality modeling remain highly uncertain and understanding of physiological failure points is needed  The mechanism of mortality for bark beetles has been found to be xylem blocking by fungi  In this context  we asked whether incorporating the combined effects of drought and bark beetle attack  and hydraulic and physiological processes  improves predictions of tree mortality  We addressed this question using Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator  TREES  applied to pinon pines in New Mexico  and mid elevation lodgepole pine and higher elevation Engelmann spruce and fir forests in Wyoming  TREES combines dynamic plant hydraulic conductance with canopy biochemical controls over photosynthesis  and the dynamics of structural and non structural carbon  NSC  through a carbon budget that responds to plant hydraulic status and a simple phloem transport model with both leaf and root NSC pools  Bayesian model data fusion was used to develop testable hypotheses on a multitude of responses Sap flux  needle gas exchange and xylem vulnerability to cavitation all supported a hydraulic failure mechanism  defined on a continuum of percent loss of conductivity  of mortality  This was confirmed by Bayesian model data fusion testing xylem dysfunction  stomatal and non stomatal controls on photosynthesis and carbon allocation  Tree transpiration in all conifer species declined after climate driven disturbance  For lodgepole pine and spruce infestation gas exchange estimates of maximum photosynthesis  day respiration and quantum yield were unchanged  The TREES model predicted a declining critical transpiration value for hydraulic failure that matched empirical measurements  For both lodgepole pine and spruce the model also predicted the contrasting dynamic of NSC increasing over the growing season for living trees and decreasing for dying trees  For pinon pines the combined effects of xylem occlusion by fungi and drought on hydraulic failure improved predictions of tree mortality over models that considered drought effects only  Our results show that models need to integrate hydraulic and physiological responses to drought and beetle induced mortality  Our analyses also show that uncertainty regarding belowground drought response remains a large driver of variation in hydraulic failure and co occurring physiological processes       
 Tree mortality  climate change and dynamic global vegetation models  The fate of tropical forests may depend  at least in part  on their response to potential future changes in their rainfall regime  We present results from an in depth model data comparison study examining the ability of four leading terrestrial biosphere models  CLM DGVM  ED2  IBIS  JULES   to simulate observed reductions in biomass in two throughfall exclusion experiments  TFEs  in the Brazilian Amazon  Models were forced with local meteorological drivers and parameterised with local soil data  so as to represent field conditions as closely as possible  Observations show a 20 25% loss of aboveground biomass in the two TFEs over 5 7 years  The models  however  are generally unable to reproduce this result  In fact  biomass stocks in most of the models appear highly insensitive to the large  ~50%  reductions in rainfall imposed upon them in the simulations  We decompose the simulated changes in biomass into impacts on growth and mortality and show that mortality processes are particularly poorly represented in the models  We find that the insensitivity in the biomass response can lead to unrealistic lags relative to the response of other variables to drought  Background mortality in JULES and IBIS depend on fixed turnover rates  so that any short term changes in biomass in these models are dominated by reductions in NPP  Over longer timescales  biomass losses driven by changes in fractional cover may ensue in these models  but the lack of explicit mortality functions precludes their ability to adequately simulate biomass responses to extreme drought events  In contrast to JULES and IBIS  CLM DGVM and ED2 both have explicit mortality functions and we explore the relative magnitudes of different modes of mortality in these models under progressively more severe drought scenarios  We conclude by identifying mortality patterns that DGVMs should ultimately aim to reproduce  These include the greater vulnerability of large canopy trees to drought relative to smaller trees but also include mortality patterns which may not be related to drought  such as the East West tree mortality gradient observed in Amazonia and the increases in mortality observed over recent decades in tropical forests       
Analysis of drought mortality with a coupled xylem and phloem transport and leaf gas exchange model Mortality of plants as a consequence of drought events has become a major focus of attention recently with the rise of severe mortality episodes around the globe  One central element of uncertainty in improving existing process based models is given by the lack of detailed understanding of the physiological processes  and their interconnections  leading to mortality  Here we present a physiological whole tree level model of water and carbon related processes  stomatal control  photosynthesis and respiration  xylem water and phloem transport  The above mentioned processes are described to be driven by environmental conditions  underlying physical restrictions  such as viscosity  diffusion resistance and water potential equilibrium   tree structural properties and biological control mechanisms  All of the processes are described in terms of water potential and sugar concentration  which are intimately connected to each other due to the requirement of water potential equilibrium  Our steady state model allows exploring the possible biological parameter space in which all species must exist and which must constrain the range of processes that may lead to hydraulic failure  carbon starvation and phloem transport failure  The mode of carbon starvation was further divided into stomatal and non stomatal related decreases in photosynthesis The simulations separated the parameter combinations leading to each type of failure  Approximately half of all parameter combinations fell into the hydraulic mode of failure and half into the carbon starvation mode of failure  Xylem embolism versus stomatal sensitivity to water potential was predicted to be important in separating these two modes of failure  Plants with sensitive stomata were predicted to die of C starvation unless they also happen to have extremely vulnerable xylem  Conversely  plants with vulnerable xylem were predicted to die of hydraulic failure unless they also happen to have extremely sensitive stomata  Phloem transport was found to become practically non functional at water potentials less than approximately  5 MPa due to excessive phloem sap viscosity build up  assuming a pure sucrose solution  Direct phloem failure occurred in very few circumstances as hydraulic failure and carbon starvation had typically occurred already at higher water potentials  However  in addition to outright failure in phloem transport  phloem transport characteristics were important in determining the within plant sugar concentrations  which affected the carbon related processes  and thus the likelihood of carbon starvation       
Quantifying the effects of drought and insect outbreaks on tree mortality rates using imperfect data	  Tree mortality rates may increase in the future due to global change type drought  which may affect mortality rates directly and/or make trees more susceptible to insect outbreaks and other biotic mortality agents  Anecdotal evidence suggests that these changes are already underway  However  there is little quantitative understanding of how drought  insects  and other environmental drivers affect tree mortality rates  These quantitative relationships are critical both for understanding observed patterns in tree mortality rates  and for testing and improving terrestrial carbon cycle models that are used to project the future state of the Earth system  The availability of national level systematic forest inventories and remote sensing products are both increasing  and these data should allow relationships between tree mortality rates and environmental drivers to be quantified  However  n environmental driver variables  e g   uncertainty in meteorological history and the spatial temporal distribution of insect outbreaks  introduce bias into statistical analyses that ignore these In most cases  driver ias statistical models towards detecting weaker effects than those that occur in reality  Similarly  model data fusion    data assimilation    with carbon cycle models is biased in the presence of driver I used computer simulations to  1  demonstrate the biases that result when n climate and insect outbreak data are ignored  and  2  explore potential solutions to this problem For a variety of non linear statistical models  driver ause the estimated effects of climate anomalies and insect outbreaks on tree mortality rates to be weaker than the true effects if driver re ignored  The problem is particularly severe if there are interactions between drought and insect outbreaks  Analytical Measurement dels are an effective and computationally cheap solution to the driver roblem  but are only appropriate for cases that are linear in parameters with normal ructures  Bayesian hierarchical models  BHMs   in which driver variables are assumed to be random samples from a probability distribution  are also an effective solution  and have no restrictions in terms of functional forms  However  BHMs are computationally expensive  and are therefore inconvenient for data exploration  Finally  if driver an be minimized by data aggregation  e g   if climate re large at the scale of individual forest inventory plots  but small at the scale of 1 degree grid cells   and if effects of drivers on mortality rates are linear at the scale of aggregation  then standard statistical methods are unbiased when applied to aggregated data       
Why can't process based models kill trees when modelling drought induced mortality  How can we fix that  Plant mortality events following droughts are occurring throughout the globe and rising mortality rates have been documented in major biomes  The American southwest and central plains regions have experienced extreme droughts both in the past few centuries that have resulted in dramatic changes in vegetation  There is currently considerable debate on the direct causes of mortality  particularly whether carbon starvation  hydraulic failure  or an interaction drives mortality  Although interest in simulating and forecasting vegetation mortality has grown substantially  no model has been developed specifically to simulate mortality because no one knows what are the empirical thresholds beyond which mortality is unavoidable  Our main goals were to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different model assumptions for examining tree mortality during drought  and to determine the physiological mechanisms resulting in mortality  emphasizing hydraulic failure and carbon starvation as mechanisms  To parameterize the models  we used results from an ecosystem scale precipitation reduction experiment at a pi ntilde on pine juniper woodland  as well as field data from central Texas in which trees exhibited substantial mortality Our modeling scenarios illustrated that some common levels of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes were predicted to co occur in dying trees by all models and therefore interactions between water use and carbon acquisition and usage made assigning a single cause for mortality difficult  Despite the large variety of model complexity used  all simulations suggested that carbon starvation was more likely than hydraulic failure per se as the primary driver mortality  In the simpler model  equations accounting for hydraulic failure and carbon starvation were only represented by a single module within the soil plant atmosphere continuum  Requiring the fewest parameters  this model over predicted tree mortality from carbon starvation  emphasizing the importance of using species specific parameters to accurately predict tree mortality  The source driven approach used in the more complex models simulated low NSC values  with the lowest predicted NSC values found when maximum death rate was recorded  As an example  trees that died had  on average  only 40% of their maximum NSC reserves  whereas trees that survived averaged 60% over the same period  Notably  those models allowed NSC to decline to zero rather than imposing a threshold  Given that NSC never reaches zero in dead trees  it is likely that imposing a threshold NSC values in models is appropriate  A common challenge to all models was process understanding belowground  including rooting depth  root cavitation  embolism refilling and carbohydrate partitioning       
 How mechanistic models with landscape resistance  direct temperature effects on life cycle timing  and the Allee effect explain bark beetle outbreaks  The mountain pine beetle  MPB  Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins   is an aggressive insect which attacks living host trees  of genus Pinus    Pines have significant defensive mechanisms  requiring the beetles to attack en masse to successfully colonize  Temperatures directly but nonlinearly influence the rates at which insects complete development in their various life stages and therefore the timing  phenology  of their emergence  Since the beetle larvae consume the phloem underneath the bark each year they exhaust their host  requiring dispersal to new trees  Adult beetles must colonize during a relatively narrow window of time to take advantage of warm temperatures for oviposition  but must also attack late enough to make sure that cold hardened larvae appear during winter freeze  Thus the beetles exist in a precarious niche depending on carefully synchronized timing and dispersal  Changing temperatures have broadened that niche across vastly larger regions  leading to tree mortality across more than thirty million hectares of western North America  Impacts due to MPB have been larger than fire  challenging researchers to predict risk factors and rates of population growth  However  statistical models fit to data at a variety of scales have failed to describe MPB outbreaks in anything more than probabilistic terms We have developed a mechanistic approach based on  differential beetle motility between forested and unforested habitats  landscape resistance   phloem temperature control of MPB phenology  and the Allee effect resulting from the need to mass attack new hosts  The resulting partial differential model describes MPB aggregation at scales commensurate with changes in host density  Solutions are complicated and discontinuous  but homogenization results in a surprisingly simple diffusive approach suitable for rapid integration over watersheds and regions and able to accommodate forest demographics resolved on 30m scales  In fact  with a speed up of over six orders of magnitude  it is feasible to calibrate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo  MCMC  procedures and Aerial Damage Survey  ADS  data from central Idaho  We determine a distribution of motility and demographic parameters in a Bayesian framework  and validate the model by comparison with ADS data collected in the eastern Cascades  This description of MPB behavior captures patterns of observed damage as well as details of demographic growth rates       
A characterization of water transport regulation in plants  implications for drought induced mortality Plants are able to survive and function under extremely variable environmental conditions  including dramatic changes in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand  This could not be achieved without powerful regulatory mechanisms at a variety of organizational and time scales  which allow plants to modulate water use in response to those changes  Drought induced mortality can be interpreted as a failure of these regulatory mechanisms  Despite a large research effort  however  we lack a coherent framework able to accommodate the variety of plant responses to reduced water availability  Our first objective was to develop a new theoretical model to describe plant responses to drying soil conditions based on the relationship between two commonly measured ecophysiological variables  midday and predawn leaf water potentials  We then applied this scheme to a newly compiled global database of leaf water potentials including data from 103 species  in order to characterize their drought responses and the phylogenetic signal of the fitted model parameters  as well as their relationships with other key hydraulic properties at the species level  Under steady state conditions  leaf water potential is a relatively simple function of soil water potential  This relationship depends on the functional responses of xylem hydraulic conductivity and stomatal conductance to soil water potential  If these responses are characterized using Weibull functions a new simplified equation is obtained that relates leaf to soil water potentials  This equation depends on two parameters  an intercept that measures transpiration capacity per unit of xylem water transport capacity  L  and a slope describing the relative sensitivity of stomatal conductance and xylem hydraulic conductivity to declining soil water potential   C gk    The latter parameter can be interpreted as a quantitative measure of stomatal behaviour  isohydric vs anisohydric   Our new model was able to capture the variability of midday water potential as a function of predawn water potential in our dataset  both within and between species  overall R 2 = 0 90   The obtained C gk estimates imply that most species reduce stomatal conductance well before appreciable losses in hydraulic conductivity occur  Parameters L and C gk showed a significant degree of phylogenetic conservatism and were negatively related  suggesting the possibility of a trade off  We also found that species with tighter stomatal control  relative to their hydraulic vulnerability  were more vulnerable to xylem embolism  We believe that this new framework offers a promising tool to study drought responses of plants and to predict their vulnerability to drought induced mortality       
 Linking definitions  mechanisms  and modeling of tree mortality  An example of modeling drought induced aspen die off in Colorado  Tree death from drought and heat stress is a critical and uncertain component in forest ecosystem responses to a changing climate  Recent research has illuminated how tree mortality is a complex cascade of changes involving interconnected plant systems over multiple timescales  Explicit consideration of the definitions  dynamics  temporal and biological scales of tree mortality research can guide experimental and modeling approaches  We examine here proposed definitions of tree mortality and their implications for the physiological variables measured in experiments and modeling approaches  We then test the ability of two different modeling approaches with differing degrees of physiological realism to simulate spatial patterns of widespread  drought induced aspen forest die off in western Colorado  The first modeling approach involves simulation of meteorological drought and soil moisture during the severe 2000 2003 period in Colorado  The second approach incorporates in a plant water deficit component in line with a water balance calculation for a tree water reserve  We compare these results against satellite estimates in the San Juan National Forest and aerial survey estimates of forest mortality at a statewide scale We first propose a definition of tree death based on a failure of whole organism function and transport that can guide modeling approaches  From our modeling exercises  we find that elevated 2002 summer temperature and low shallow soil moisture were most associated with the spatial patterns of aspen mortality at a statewide scale  Four modeled climate and soil parameters explained around 32% of the spatial variance in watershed scale mortality  These results agreed with ongoing stable isotope work regarding from what soil layers and precipitation source aspens draw their water  The second modeling approach revealed that topographically mediated controls on climatic water deficit provide a useful way of simulating tree mortality from a water balance approach  We conclude by discussing the relative importance of physiological understanding in hindcasting and forecasting forest mortality at different spatial and temporal scales  as well as key gaps in data needed for testing and evaluating models       
Modeling the response of tree mortality rates to climate anomalies using non randomly sampled data that targets unusual mortality events Tree mortality rates are principal drivers of the forest carbon cycle and are expected to increase in many regions of the world due to global change type drought  Numerous published studies document apparently drought induced tree mortality events and associated climate anomalies  These studies provide a wealth of information that could be harnessed to model the responses of mortality rates to climate change and extreme weather conditions  However  quantitative analyses based on mortality events described in the literature pose special challenges  due to potential reporting biases  the tendency for unusual mortality events to be reported in the literature  and sampling biases  the tendency for unusual mortality events to be studied   We derived a maximum likelihood estimator for parameters linking tree mortality rates to climate anomalies  e g   drought events  using data collected with non random    event based   sampling that preferentially targets times/places with unusually high mortality rates  Here we report results of a computer simulation study designed to test the method  Our test involves   1  generating artificial data  with noise  assuming a predefined relationship between mortality rate and annual precipitation anomaly   2  applying the event based statistical method to simulated data sets representing different sampling strategies      different proportions of event based vs  randomly sampled data  and different sample sizes  and  3  comparing the estimated parameter values with the true values For all sampling strategies  ranging from 0 to 100% randomly sampled data  as opposed to event based data   our event based statistical method was unbiased in that the 95% confidence intervals on the parameter estimates included the true parameter values in about 95% of trials  That is  the event based method yields unbiased results whether applied to event based or randomly sampled data  If the starting values in the parameter estimation algorithm were far from the true values  then the event based approach was robust only if the sampling strategy included at least some randomly sampled data  In practice  this is not an important limitation of the method  because some randomly sampled data  or at least data not targeted at known mortality events  would be available in most applications  Our results show that published literature on drought induced mortality  even if it collected with a biased sampling strategy  can be combined with systematic forest inventory data in a quantitative framework to estimate unbiased relationships between tree mortality rates and climate anomalies       
Effects of landscape context and seasonality on time to recovery Populations of many species are stressed due to a plethora of anthropogenic activities  To ensure the persistence of their populations  the correct assessment of the time required for a population to recover from stress is of pivotal importance for the field of ecosystem management  The sole focus on the life history of the species  and in particular its intrinsic population growth rate r   gives an optimistic predictor of recovery times  In a most simple model  the time an exponentially growing population needs to return to a fraction of the size it had before disturbance is a simple linear function of 1/ r   Recovery times obtained from models incorporating more ecological realism  like spatially explicit individual based models  IBM   are not that straightforward to predict  When introducing space  recovery times become dependent on the landscape context  in particular on the choice of spatial scales for modelling population dynamics  for exposure to stress  and for observing recovery  Under temporally varying conditions  recovery times will in particular depend on the choice of constant versus seasonally varying conditions  In simple IBMs for aquatic and terrestrial species with different life history  mobility  dispersal mechanism and generation times   we investigate the impact of spatial dimensions and of seasonality of the environment on recovery times  The role of spatial dimensions is analysed in systems with continuous habitat  of which only a part is exposed to lethal stress  and in which recovery can be measured in sub systems ranging in size from the exposed part to the whole system  The role of seasonality is analysed by comparing recovery for species with different generation times  in non seasonal systems  with continuous reproduction  and in seasonal systems  in which seasonality leads to some synchronization  reproduction peaks   We explain the underlying mechanisms  identify whether specific choices should be considered worst case or not  and deduce rules of thumb based on species traits  that aid in selecting an appropriate worst case setup for model studies at similar scales       
 Experimental and modeling approaches for understanding the boom and bust population dynamics of the pollution indicator  Capitella teleta  Compared to marine hard bottom communities  the exact mechanisms of density dependence in marine soft bottom communities are less well understood  Deposit feeders are key components of soft bottom communities  Though it is widely accepted that populations of deposit feeders are food limited  other factors than exploitation competition  such as competition for space and inter individual interference  may also affect population density  We explored the mechanisms of density dependence in the widespread deposit feeder  Capitella teleta  formerly Capitella sp  I   which dominates in polluted sediments and which shows highly variable population dynamics  There are at least two mechanisms by which worms may compete  through competition for ingestible particles and through direct physical interference among individuals  We designed our study to distinguish between these two mechanisms of density dependence by independently manipulating the amount and quality of sediment available to worm populations  The experiment was set up with 5 treatments  a control treatment  100% natural sediment  low worm density   two treatments with reduced organic content  75 % natural sediment and 50 % natural sediment  and two treatments with increased initial worm densities  manipulated by reducing the amount of natural sediment per worm to achieve a medium density and a high density compared to the control treatment  For all treatments there was an initial increase in population size measured both as worm biomass and abundance  Population size peaked after a number of weeks  and thereafter declined as the sediment was depleted of food  Populations in the 100 % natural sediment  low density  seemed to grow to a higher total biomass and abundance compared to both populations with less space      higher initial density  and populations that lived in sediment of a lower food quality  Whereas time to reach peak population size did not differ among treatments  peak size      total biomass  did differ  In addition  there was a clear trend of decreasing peak size with increasing initial population density or decreasing sediment quality  sediment organic content   These results provide insights into the relative importance of food limitation and inter individual interactions in limiting worm population dynamics       
Compensatory immigration depends on adjacent population size and habitat quality but not on landscape connectivity  Populations experiencing localized mortality can recover in the short term by net movement of individuals from adjacent areas  a process called compensatory immigration or spillover  Little is known about the factors influencing the magnitude of compensatory immigration or its impact on source populations  Such information is important for understanding metapopulation dynamics  the use of protected areas for conservation  management of exploited populations and pest control  Using two small  territorial damselfish species   Stegastes diencaeus and S  adustus   in their naturally fragmented habitat  we quantified compensatory immigration in response to localized mortality  assessed its impact on adjacent source populations and examined the importance of potential immigrants  habitat quality and landscape connectivity as limiting factors  On seven experimental sites  we repeatedly removed 15% of the initial population size until none remained and immigration ceased  Immigrants replaced 16  72% of original residents in S  diencaeus and 0  69% in S  adustus   The proportion of the source population that immigrated into depleted areas varied from 9% to 61% in S  diencaeus and from 3% to 21% in S  adustus   In S  diencaeus   compensatory immigration was strongly affected by habitat quality  to a lesser extent by the abundance of potential immigrants and not by landscape connectivity  In S  adustus   immigration was strongly affected by the density of potential migrants and not by habitat quality and landscape connectivity  On two control sites  immigration in the absence of creation of vacancies was extremely rare  Immigration occurred in response to localized mortality and was therefore compensatory  It was highly variable  sometimes producing substantial impacts on both depleted and source populations  The magnitude of compensatory immigration was influenced primarily by the availability of immigrants and by the potential improvement in territory quality that they could achieve by immigrating and not by their ability to reach the depleted area       
Recovery in frequently disturbed landscapes  Recolonization consequences for source areas Populations in frequently disturbed landscapes  such as agroecosystems  may often experience significant losses  In such systems  many species carry important roles as providing units of ecosystem services  those ecosystem functions that are essential for sustaining human populations  To ensure the provision of such services  we need to therefore ensure the population persistence of key species in ecosystems  Recolonization of stressed habitats is one of the major and initial mechanisms of population recovery  The stressed and adjacent  non stressed areas  can be compared to sinks and sources in classical metapopulation theory which predicts that movement between sinks and sources will not adversely affect the sources  as  by definition  the sinks are suboptimal habitats to which organisms are not generally adapted  When the sink habitats are those that are in essence the same as source habitats  only frequently disturbed species will not be adapted to avoiding them and significant losses from source areas may be assumed  This has been shown in theoretical and some field studies  Furthermore  this phenomenon may be enhanced in riverine networks where habitats are fully connected with a directional movement of organisms  through current velocities and drift   In our study  we tested such a riverine system and looked for consequences of colonization for the source habitats and the population in the total landscape  We simulated the dynamics of two species often found in European freshwater networks  Asellus aquaticus and Gammarus pulex   both significant contributors to the process of leaf litter decomposition  Our simulated landscapes span from simple linear water bodies to more complex ditch systems found in agricultural landscapes  We looked into how the severity and frequency of stress affected the population sizes in the sink and source habitats  Furthermore  we explored the consequences of recolonization on survival in sink habitats  as a possible compensatory mechanism for the population in the whole landscape  Our results show that the adverse effects of colonization in source areas depend on the complexity of the specific water network  and are in general spatially constrained  Expectedly  they increase with the frequency and severity of stress and are also dependent on the organism mobility  We discuss these findings in relation to real systems  with a special emphasis on the level of spatial scale at which such effects may be both measured and relevant       
Statistical indicators and state space population models predict extinction in a population of bobwhite quail Early warning indicators of extinction thresholds have been developed for and tested in microcosm experiments  but verification in populations of wild animals has not occurred  We developed a statistical indicator to detect a transcritical bifurcation extinction threshold that is robust to observational esent in data collected for monitoring purposes  We then used our indicator to detect an extinction threshold using two independent data sets from a population of bobwhite quail   Colinus virginianus   located in southeastern Nebraska  USA  Finally  we compared predictions derived from our statistical indicator to predictions from commonly used state space population models  Comparison of indicators to model based methods provides a standard to evaluate the predictive ability of indicators   The extinction threshold was detectible using both data sets  With our statistical indicator we estimated that the extinction threshold will be crossed in 2017  2012 minus 2028  using the whistle count  WC  data set and in 2012  2009 minus 2020  using the Breeding Bird Survey  BBS  data set  Using state space population models we estimated that our study population crossed the extinction threshold in 2010  2002 minus 2036  using the WC data set and in 2008  1999 minus 2064  using BBS data set  Based on results from microcosm experiments  we expect extinction in our study population after crossing the extinction threshold  but the time to extinction and potential to reverse the extinction threshold are unknown       
Ecological impacts of two years of extreme drought in a mesic grassland  Rapid recovery despite an extreme response Climate extremes  such as drought and heat waves  are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity over the next century  We examined the response of a mesic tallgrass prairie ecosystem to two years of experimentally imposed seasonal drought and a short term heat wave  followed by a recovery year  During 2010 and 2011  we reduced precipitation inputs to 33% of ambient rainfall  drought  to compare responses to a well watered treatment  ambient rainfall plus supplemental irrigation   The drought treatment resulted in a 50% reduction in soil water content in both years  Under these contrasting soil moisture regimes we imposed a two week mid summer heat wave at four temperature levels  ranging from 0 to +11 degrees C above ambient  In 2012  all plots received ambient rainfall plus supplemental irrigation to ensure that long term average precipitation inputs were received  This design allowed us to examine the individual and combined effects of drought and heat on ecosystem structure  plant community  and function  aboveground net primary production  ANPP   We used local long term historical records of both weather  112 years  Manhattan  KS  and ANPP  27 years  Konza Prairie LTER  to determine whether the imposed treatments and ecological responses were statistically extreme The experientially imposed seasonal drought and heat waves were well outside the bounds of normal variability and comparable in magnitude to the most severe years of the 1930  s Dust Bowl  While we measured no significant direct or combined effects of the imposed heat waves at the ecosystem or community levels  there were significant effects of drought  Total ANPP was significantly decreased in both drought years  and particularly during the second year of the drought  which was below the 5 th percentile of the long term LTER record for the site  Despite this extreme ecosystem level response  we observed full recovery in ANPP in the first year following drought  This occurred even with a substantial drought induced shift in community composition during the post drought year  caused by a reordering in the rank abundances of the four dominant species  In summary  two years of extreme drought led to a decoupling of grassland structure and function  during the drought we observed an extreme reduction in productivity with no change in community structure  while after the event  there was a full recovery in production despite a significant change in community structure  Such changes in community structure could have important consequences for stability in ecosystem function over the long term       
Spatial resilience  The role of local positive feedbacks for large scale collapse and recovery The concept of alternative stable states has become an influential paradigm in ecology  Implications of alternative states are profound from a restoration perspective  but also when it comes to understanding the potential response of ecosystems to change in conditions such as the climate  A problem in extrapolating our current insights to such problems is that so far most work on alternative stable states comes from relatively small and spatially isolated systems such as lakes and ponds  from controlled  isolated experiments  or from small enclosures in large scale systems  In reality we often face spatially extended heterogeneous ecosystems rather than well isolated homogeneous ecosystems  The question how stability changes in spatial settings is still underexplored  We used classical bi stable models in a spatial context to systematically explore how local positive feedback that lead to local alternative stable states  could affect large scale collapse and recovery   We show that resilience of the dominant state in a spatially extensive system does not change gradually as environmental conditions change  in contrast to a well mixed system  Instead  resilience remains large  until it drops sharply around a critical level of the environmental factor  a   stationary front bifurcation    where it becomes fragile in the sense that even a rather small local perturbation can cause a domino effect leading to a systemic shift to the more resilient state  Our results hint at conditions under which restoration efforts can succeed or fail locally  or even cascade through a landscape  Importantly  they also hint at factors that may determine the character of major biome shifts projected to happen as a result of climatic change       
Slower recovery in space before collapse of connected populations Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes in a wide variety of systems  Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators  However  the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long term observations  Large scale spatial data are more accessible  but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems needs to be examined empirically  We used spatially extended yeast populations to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel warning indicator in space  Yeast cells grow cooperatively in sucrose by sharing the hydrolysis products  creating positive feedback between cells that leads to bistability and a tipping point  By increasing the daily dilution factor  equivalent to a mortality rate   we could manipulate yeast populations to collapse at conditions beyond the tipping point  We connected yeast populations spatially through controlled dispersal between nearest neighbors on a one dimensional array  Population densities were recorded daily by measuring optical density We found that two leading indicators based on spatio temporal fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations  however  the magnitude of increase was smaller than that observed in isolated populations  possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal  Furthermore  we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns    recovery length    As the spatial counterpart of recovery time  recovery length is defined as the distance for connected populations to recover from perturbations in space  e g  a region of poor quality   In our experiments  recovery length increased substantially before population collapse  suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems  Our work illustrates the important role of spatial coupling  such as the dispersal of populations  in understanding how to apply the current toolbox of warning indicators to natural populations       
Alternative stable states in marine food webs    preventing recovery of overexploited fish stocks 	  The potential occurrence of alternative stable states  ASS      the presence of hysteresis  in marine food webs is receiving increasing attention  If present  ASS have important consequences for how to manage exploitation of the oceans  For example  by preventing recovery of e g  overexploited top piscivores following reduced exploitation rates  While abrupt changes in species composition have occurred in marine food webs world wide  it remains to be demonstrated whether these constitute hysteresis  In several systems  a number of species interactions have been suggested as mechanisms with potential to cause ASS  leading to alternative states with and without top piscivorous fish  These include mixed interactions  such as intra guild predation  leading to so called cultivation depensation effects  and mutual predation  where prey fish predate on early life stages of top piscivores  as well as predation induced changes in prey growth  resulting in poor prey condition or prey population structures with fewer individuals vulnerable to predation  But do these mechanisms occur in exploited marine food webs  Here we use theory on size dependent community dynamics to derive a data analysis framework to identify the presence of these mechanisms leading to ASS with and without top piscivorous fish in natural exploited systems  We present the data analysis framework in the form of a decision tree  which based on results from analyses of piscivore and prey performance and abundances  distinguishes between ASS caused by cultivation depensation  mutual predation  and indirect predation effects  Specifically  we show the piscivore growth patterns  changes in vital rates and abundance  and in biomass and performance of their fish prey and lower trophic level preys  that are consistent with each type of ASS mechanism  Finally  we apply the data analysis framework on the case of Baltic Sea cod  and illustrate each analysis step in the decision tree  Preliminary results show shifts in growth of both non piscivorous and piscivorous stages of cod  suggesting the presence of more than one of the ASS mechanisms  In conclusion  predictions from physiologically based model studies of community dynamics can be used to identify the presence of ASS mechanisms in natural exploited food webs  affecting the potential for piscivore recoveries   but require detailed data on the performance and abundance of piscivores in different ontogenetic stages and of their respective preys       
Early warning indicators fail to forewarn of impending kelp forest regime shifts Many ecological communities exhibit alternative states characterized by fundamentally different species abundances  with one state often being less desirable than the other  The threat of tipping points between these states    whereby even small  incrememental changes in a driving variable can lead to large scale reorganizational changes in community structure    has motivated the development of indicators to forewarn of approaching transitions  In particular  a growing body of literature illustrates how the phenomena of critical slowing down  decreasing response rates to small stochastic perturbations  and flickering  switching back and forth between states in response to stochastic perturbations  can lead to increases in the temporal autocorrelation and the variance  across space and in time  of species abundances before the tipping point is reached  We assessed the utility of a suite of such indicators to forewarn of tipping points in the southern California kelp forests of San Nicolas Island  Like elsewhere around the globe  these kelp forests are characterized by two general states  a kelp dominated state and an urchin dominated state  The time series of kelp and urchin abundance dynamics we analyzed reflect 31 years of biannual sampling performed in fixed location plots at six sites surrounding the island Calibrated Bayesian change point analysis of kelp and urchin dynamics provided objective evidence for the occurence of multiple state shifts of varying magnitude  posterior probabilities associated with the inference of a state shift having occurred varied continuously from zero to one  Two sites where population sizes varied cyclically showed no evidence for state shifts having occured  None of the spatial or temporal indicators we assessed showed evidence of being able to forewarn of impending tipping points  Neither the normalized indicator values preceeding a given time point  nor the run length of increasing indicator values preceeding a given time point  was positively associated with that time point  s posterior probability of having exhibited a state shift  Furthermore  time points exhibiting a near zero state shift probability were equally  if not more likely  to be preceeded by high indicator values and runs of increasing indicator values than were time points exhibiting a high state shift probability  Rates of false positive warnings were equally high for the two sites where no state shift occurred  Our analyses therefore echo recent theoretical arguments warning against an overreliance on early warning indicators in management and conservation practices       
Bioeconomy transitions  Cross sector collaboration at the conservation economy nexus	  Production and marketing of perennial grasses for bioenergy and bio products potentially delivers conservation  amenity  and production benefits at landscape scales  However  market inertia resulting from uncertainty and risk has stalled development of bioeconomies  National policy has had limited impact on the inertia  Transitions to future bioeconomies  therefore  may require novel interventions  A potentially transformative approach is collaborative design  deployment and monitoring of at scale bioenergy systems as jointly undertaken pilot initiatives  As think  and do tanks collaborative pilot initiatives can reduce the time  financial resources and expertise required of individual participants  otherwise acting alone  to understand and benefit from novel systems  We are piloting a cross sector collaborative approach to multi objective bioenergy project development in southern Wisconsin  Our goal is to produce a distributable  socially innovative model of project development that demonstrates the sustainability advantages within the conservation economy nexus  We anticipate greater opportunity for communities and businesses to gain entry into and influence direction of nascent bioeconomies  This in turn will lead to bioeconomy expansion with increased landscape multifunctionality over time  The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and the University of Wisconsin Madison have jointly initiated a landscape scale biomass harvest experiment  The experiment is the basis for understanding whether production and harvest of diverse perennial grass communities fulfills wildlife habitat management goals  feasibility of diverse end uses of harvested materials  and formation of local value chains  Building upon the experiment  core collaborators from industry  agribusiness  and research have initiated a collaborative process to achieve multiple objectives including  location of an anaerobic digester that uses perennial grass biomass  exploration of landscape configurations of perennial grass production and alternative supply chain scenarios  understanding effects on existing markets of animal bedding and conventional haying  establishing system monitoring protocols  and formulation of adaptive responses to knowledge gained over time  While the challenges are many  essential progress has been achieved in commitment among collaborators  identification of shared values  and the formation of a strategic plan  Future goals include partnership with a dedicated energy off taker and engagement with a wider stake holder group       
Bioenergy from reserve native grasslands  Measuring harvest and monitoring wildlife This project is part of a broad effort to sustain Minnesota resources while improving the rural economy and contributing to our energy independence  The project tests best management practices to maintain grassland habitat for wildlife while generating revenue from bioenergy  A major objective of the project is to identify biomass harvesting patterns that maintain wildlife populations by leaving distinct size and shapes of refuges within the grassland  but doing so while harvesting the greatest sustainable amount of biomass from the sites  Over 1000 acres of restored grasslands across western Minnesota have been divided into 20 acre plots  The plots are organized in three locations spanning the temperature range of Minnesota  Wildlife surveys encompass birds  small mammals  and insects  with special attention to pollinators  Bioenergy surveys will monitor changes in plant communities and differences in bioenergy potential from production scale harvests  Results will be used to develop guides for landowners and to produce standard protocols for bioenergy and wildlife evaluations  Similar reports will be produced for state land managing entities to improve management efficiency and potentially reduce costs of habitat management  Wildlife and vegetative survey results are being analyzed and preliminary results follow  Small mammals   Microtus  genus level  abundance declined and short tailed shrews   Blarina brevicauda   abundance did not change  Occupancy analysis was performed for seven small mammals  percent harvest affected the presence of both Microtus and masked shrews   Sorex cinerea   negatively  S ong birds  No differences were observed in species richness or total number of species  but no abundances increased with harvest  Preliminary results are that four of ten birds surveyed were affected by harvest  including the sedge wren  which is of conservation concern  Game bird nesting  Daily survival rates were calculated for waterfowl and pheasant nests in harvested and un harvested areas within the study  Preliminary results suggest that biomass harvest does not change the probability of a nest surviving  QuIST  The Quantitative Insect Sampling Technique is a new method that allowed for calibrating standard insect collection methods  Bioenergy potential   Fall harvest during the first four years of this project had no statistically significant effect on bioenergy potential  That is  four years of harvest did not diminish grassland yield potential  Plant community percent cover   A preliminary result is that no change was observed in composition of plant functional group with harvest       
Developing an integrated biomass/biofuel production system using the Mississippi/Missouri River corridor	  The Mississippi/Missouri River corridor includes the floodplain and associated upland landscape  stretching from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico  It is a region with declining population  high poverty and unemployment  and disproportionate contribution to climate change and other environmental problems  However  the region is uniquely positioned to support a dynamic multi billion gallon advanced biofuels industry based on its combination of agricultural  forestry  logistics  and industrial assets  The region is networked by a superior logistics system that includes cost effective barge  rail  and road systems and is already equipped with extensive industrial infrastructure with excess capacity and trained workers capable of producing advanced biofuels and biobased products  However  how can we develop a sustainable supply of biomass in this corridor to help the emerging biomass and biofuels industry The region offers large acreages of both marginal  116 million acres  and productive land  100 million acres  with a variety of soil types  surplus surface and groundwater  favorable climate and growing seasons  and the largest biomass production potential in the nation  Converting 10% of the marginal land to dedicated energy crops such as grasses or short rotation woody crops can provide a sustainable supply of biomass to produce up to 8 billion gallons of advanced biofuels from this corridor  In addition to providing a $24 billion net economic impact  such a sustainable biomass production systems could offer a number of environmental benefits  It will create new wildlife habitat  establish corridors and connectivity with existing natural areas  sequester carbon  and improve water quality  For example  20 to 80% reduction in nitrate loading into streams and rivers can be accomplished by placing perennial biomass crops along riparian areas of farmlands  Developing a biomass corridor could not only support an emerging bio based industry  but also provide a multitude of conservation benefits to society at large       
Bridging the conservation lands    working lands divide with a cost effective strategy to enhance ecosystem services With much of the U S  Midwest in agricultural production and under private ownership  any viable conservation practice must fit within the context of currently profitable production systems  We study the ability of strategically integrated   prairie strips    contour buffer and filter strips composed of diverse  native  perennial plants  to achieve this  We hypothesize that the conversion of small amounts of row cropped watersheds to native prairie can provide environmental quality and conservation benefits that are disproportionately greater than expected based on the land area converted  We have been testing this hypothesis since 2007 at the Strategic Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies  STRIPs  research and demonstration site  a replicated watershed experiment at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in central Iowa  USA Thus far  we have found that prairie strips comprising 10 20% of no till corn bean agricultural catchments reduce sediment transport by 95%  total phosphorus and nitrogen transport by 90%  and surface water flow by 60% compared to catchments entirely in no till corn bean agriculture  These results are consistent across a range of weather conditions  including high rainfall and drought years  Prairie strips also provide habitat for native plants  insect pollinators and natural enemies  and birds  including some species of greatest conservation need  Financial analysis of the practice reveals that depending upon total area covered by strips relative to the whole field  the annualized present value costs of using prairie strips can be as little as $59 to $87 per treated ha/yr  If prairie strips were under a 15 year Conservation Reserve Program contract  total annual cost to farmers would be reduced by over 85%  and affordable compared to other common conservation practices  such as terraces and wetlands  We also share insights from implementing prairie strips on privately owned farms  In sum  prairie strips offer a way to efficiently meet multiple conservation goals through easy and flexible incorporation into existing farming systems  hence  an effective means of bridging the conservation lands   working lands divide       
Nature in balance  Achieving landscape scale prairie conservation through value innovation	  In every generation there is a window of opportunity to fulfill a role in the industrial revolution of technology  Today there is an opening to provide economy  environmental advantage and energy security and independence  Advancement in our ability to produce biomethane  green natural gas  through biomass crop and residue anaerobic digestion bioenergy conversion  wastewater treatment  and nutrient management  combined with technology advances in hydraulic fracturing of natural gas  blue natural gas  from shale rock layers  is an opportunity to reach significant scale toward social ecological innovation goal  Such fuels in the form of compressed natural gas  CNG  and liquefied natural gas  LNG  serve as a clean burning source  ninety percent cleaner burning as compared to diesel fuel  while providing economic advantage for our vehicle transport market sector and our nation  s overall economic competitiveness  Our goal must include a sustainable source of biomass that not only provides financial return for the landowner  entrepreneur  and U S  taxpayer  but also protects and enhances wildlife conservation  other ecosystem services  and climate  There is mounting scientific evidence that we can use diverse native prairie planting to anchor our strategic planning and implementation initiatives and drive realization of social ecological goal  To that end  we have assembled a high performing team of leading public and private organizations possessing a wide diversity of perspective  strategic vision  science and technology knowledge  integration skill  and depth of resource to tackle our challenge of restoration of 15 000+ acres of native prairie grasses on Highly Erodible Lands  HEL  combined with anaerobic digestion processing of a diverse mixture of prairie grass and an unprecedented concentration of residue from farm livestock production  the largest concentration of livestock residue of its kind in our nation  for commercial production of vehicle sector biofuel  Outcome of these efforts are development of science  technology  and financial business model for eco commerce as well as knowhow for replication by individual landowner and cooperatives on a decentralized basis throughout the Midwest to achieve superordinate goal of 30+ million acres of prairie restoration and effective demonstration model for global initiatives in developing land use and food production for fast growing global populations       
Knowing the   shed   of one another  s ecosystem service   shared consequences of individual land management decisions	  The concept and analysis of watersheds profoundly influences and informs cooperative land management  Increased awareness and understanding of ecosystem services suggest that it is more than just water that can be managed cooperatively at a landscape scale  Improved quantitative understanding of the geographic flows of many different services can provide insights for policy and cooperative management schemes to more effectively manage landscapes for other services  For example  our recent work shows that native pollinator abundance on specialty crops depends jointly on farm management practice and the quality of the landscape surrounding the farm  Thus  a grower  s decision about land management affects the delivery of pollination service to the grower  s farm but to some extent  also affects the delivery of service to nearby growers  What are the consequences of these decisions for these two scales  We used a previously developed spatially explicit model of pollination service to answer three interrelated questions  1  for an individual grower  what is the combination of crop and pollinator providing natural habitat that maximizes profit   2  How does this combination change as a function of the crop  s dependence on native pollinators     the landscape   and 3  how would we expect landscape to change if other growers making independent decisions were also part of the landscape  We found that although we can engineer an optimal landscape for a single individual  individual decision making with multiple individuals leads to tragedy of the pollination commons  in which the individual growers  acting in their own best interests  create a sub optimal landscape  Much like watershed management that uses our quantitative understanding of hydrology  cooperative management  using our understanding of pollination  can provide guidance on policies necessary to avoid tragic  sub optimal landscapes       
Governing public and private rights and responsibilities in multifunctional landscapes	  Environmental governance involves efforts by government and nongovernmental organizations to incentivize  regulate  and produce ecosystem services such as water quality  food and bioenergy production  recreation  and groundwater recharge  This research applies the examines policies to produce ecosystem services in a Midwestern landscape in order to reveal how public and private rights and responsibilities for ecosystem services are negotiated in policymaking and implementation  To examine the governance of multifunctional landscapes  we asked  1  How do public policies    including acquisitions  incentives and regulation    frame public and private rights and responsibilities related to bundles of ecosystem services  2  Does the spatial targeting of ecosystem service policies create multifunctional landscapes at the property  subwatershed  or municipal scale  The study site is Wisconsin  s Yahara Watershed  which has prominent lakes and a mix of urban and rural landscapes including dairy farms  public forestland  and the state  s second largest city  We conducted policy content analysis  informational interviews  and spatial analysis of the location of policy implementation efforts with a Geographic Information System Content analysis of policies revealed how policy makers frame ecosystem services from public and private lands in order to justify effective use of public funds for diverse public interests  Despite an emphasis on synergies in policy framing  a Geographic Information System map and spatial cluster analysis of interventions showed that implementation of ecosystem service policies is fragmented across parcels  Parcel level analysis revealed the clustering of ecosystem service targeting while subwatershed and municipal level analysis obscured these spatial patterns  Local leaders and natural resource managers aim to develop landscape scale production of multifunctional landscapes  However  path dependency and the fragmentation of property rights  policy administration  and interest groups present limits for a technical approach to optimizing landscape function       
Both sides now  Forging links between grassland conservation on protected areas and private lands	  Scientists have called repeatedly for a broader conservation agenda that emphasizes not only protected areas but also the landscapes in which they are embedded  In response  we developed a conceptual model to guide the integration of conservation actions on reserves and private lands  Economic and conservation goals are viewed as intertwined and mutually reinforcing  Reserves assume a new role as natural laboratories where alternative land use practices can be explored  At the heart of the model is a transfer of conservation practices from reserves to the properties of a small number of key landowners  ultimately followed by a transfer of practices from these properties and reserves to the broader community  Successful implementation should ultimately result in broad scale restoration that improves a region  s capacity to conserve biodiversity and to support landowner goals  thus increasing the resilience of the overarching social ecological system  In 2010  we began to implement the model in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and northern Missouri  U S A  Here  a salient threat to grass based enterprises  including biodiversity conservation  is the encroachment of woody vegetation  Mitigating this threat will require the use of prescribed fire  a management tool that is rarely used on private lands in the region   Through a series of surveys  interviews  and field days on reserves  we have engaged a group of key landowners  Members of this group have since attended a prescribed fire workshop and participated in prescribed burns on several of their properties  Among this group  there has been a growing awareness of threats to grassland biodiversity and to grassland enterprises generally  as well as strategies for effectively mitigating these threats  Generally  however  landowners in the region do not perceive their properties as parts of a larger whole  resulting in the lack of a collective vision for managing the grassland ecosystem  Consequently  the magnitude of the threat posed by the rapid encroachment of invasive woody plants is not widely appreciated  Rather  this phenomenon tends to be viewed as a nuisance that landowners will address on their individual properties as necessary  Prescribed fire is generally viewed as a legitimate land management tool  yet perceived risks associated with this practice tend to outweigh the eventual loss of forage and grassland habitats  These perceptions and beliefs create a tension between successful transfer of conservation practices to private lands and a widespread state shift in the region from grasslands to woodlands       
Pollination services in a social ecological system  Understanding the impact of land cover on bee populations in a seasonally dry tropical landscape to inform ecosystem service incentive schemes Ecosystem services  ES  such as pollination are critical for agricultural and non managed ecosystems but may be disrupted by certain land cover types within complex agricultural landscapes  Pollination by native bees is vulnerable to agricultural intensification and management practices  and is a globally threatened service  Payments for Ecosystem Services  PES  have gained attention as a method of incentivizing land cover and management that maximizes ES provision  In Costa Rica  PES have been provided to landowners who reforest with agroforestry  native secondary forest  or timber plantations  but there is little data linking these land cover types with specific ES  such as pollination  We ask  How do the abundance and diversity of bee populations compare in high  elevation pasture  low elevation pasture  teak plantations  and coffee agroforestry systems in the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica  Bee abundance and diversity can be used as a proxy for the spatial and temporal availability of pollination services  and will be assessed using standard trapping and sweep net surveys over a two year period  In addition  we will observe bee visitation of coffee and teak flowers and identify blooming flora in the plots to assess the impact of floral resource availability  and evaluate the influence of landscape context  This presentation will discuss results from fieldwork conducted during spring 2013  including the abundance and diversity of bees and the relative temporal availability of floral resources in each land cover type  Since agricultural land cover types may lack the nesting habitat and floral diversity needed to support bee populations  we expected bee abundance and diversity to decrease with distance from secondary forest in all plots  In addition  we expected this change to be most pronounced in teak plantations and pasture  Results demonstrate that floral resources were present year round in the secondary forest  but were most abundant during the dry season  Coffee and teak bloom briefly during the rainy season  and had fewer floral resources during the majority of the study  Bee species diversity and abundance were lower in teak plantations compared to other land uses  This study is part of an interdisciplinary evaluation of multiple ES by land cover types in the peninsula and the value attributed to these services by residents  It will contribute to our understanding of the impact of PES both locally and in the many places worldwide where they are being employed       
Are there tradeoffs in plant dynamics in grasslands managed for carbon sequestration  Grasslands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services  Management interventions that aim to increase one type of service may have secondary effects on others  Grasslands occupy a large geographic area and are thought to have considerable capacity to increase soil carbon  C  storage  As a result  there has been appreciable interest in managing grasslands for C sequestration  Compost amendments and keyline plowing are two techniques that have been proposed for soil C sequestration in grasslands  However  these practices also alter nutrient dynamics  water flows  and soil structure  which may in turn affect plant dynamics  The impact of these practices on net primary production  NPP   plant community structure  and forage nutritional quality are not well known  but critical for understanding potential tradeoffs among C sequestration  fostering biodiversity  and economic sustainability of managed grasslands  We used replicated field experiments in two bioclimatic regions of California  valley and coastal grasslands  to investigate the separate and combined effects of compost amendments and keyline plowing on plant growth  community composition  and plant nitrogen  N  content The plant community at the valley grassland was dominated by exotic annual grasses and was less species rich than that of the coastal grassland  which consisted of a mix of perennial and annual grasses and forbs  Overall  plant communities at both grasslands were relatively resistant to these management events  but responses of some individual species were observed  Notably  we detected a short term increase in the abundance of a noxious forb   Carthamus lanatus   at the coastal grassland and a decrease in abundance of a noxious annual grass   Taeniatherum caput medusae   at the valley grassland with the combined compost and keyline plow treatment  We observed significant increases in aboveground biomass and plant N content following compost amendment at both sites  which persisted for four years  Our results suggest that a single application of the keyline plow produced short term     1 y  declines in aboveground biomass and changes to noxious weed abundance  and that a single application of compost produced sustained increases in aboveground biomass and forage nutritional quality without affecting the floristic communities of these annual grasslands  The lack of major shifts in vegetation or prolonged responses of noxious species suggests that there are few trade offs between C sequestration and plant dynamics in these grasslands       
Why are belowground responses to management and their feedbacks to crops so difficult to predict 	  Responses of belowground processes to management in agroecosystems are highly variable  especially when the crops and soils are not being inundated with exogenous inputs to overwhelm resource limitations  Understanding how combinations of soil physical  chemical  and biological factors interact to influence crops in low input cropping systems is even more difficult  I will explore how managing belowground processes in agroecosystems for ecosystem services such as N availability to plants for yield  N retention to minimize loss to aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere  and soil C accumulation to mitigate climate change  Our ability to predict plant responses to inputs is predictable at coarse levels of resolution in simplified plant communities  but in polycultures these responses are often swamped by species composition  soils  and other management factors  If diversified agroecosystems are to flourish  we will need to understand these complex dynamics mechanistically or find ways to manage for a relatively high degree of uncertainty  especially in the face of more erratic weather patterns  This latter approach has been the focus of grazing management in arid and semi arid rangelands for over half a century  but has not gained traction in cropping systems       
Management impacts on soil carbon sequestration  A case study evaluating perennial and annual cereal production systems Agriculture has a tremendous   ecological footprint   as it is a leading contributor to carbon dioxide emissions  and other potent greenhouse gases  At the same time  innovative agricultural practices have the potential to mitigate climate change  by sequestering carbon  A transformative approach to a more sustainable agriculture has been proposed through developing perennial grain cropping systems  which produce edible grain without the need to till and replant every year  This new type of grain crop has the potential to enhance ecosystem services such as soil conservation  and soil C sequestration  In June 2012  deep soil cores  1m  were taken at the Kellogg Biological Station  KBS  in a field experiment with contrasting cereal crops  an annual winter wheat and a perennial intermediate wheatgrass  The crops are grown under a management gradient  Organic  Low N conventional  and High N conventional   providing an opportunity to test interactions of species with management  We quantified above and belowground biomass as well as soil C  labile fraction  in each system to determine whether or not soil C increased under the perennial grain system The perennial intermediate wheatgrass systems had higher total biomass across all three managements  Organic  Low N conventional  and High N conventional  compared to annual wheat  Total root biomass  fine and coarse roots  was three to four times greater in the perennial systems  P    0 05  compared too annual rot biomass  In both annual and perennial systems  root biomass was highest in the High N management system  however  significant differences across management were not evident  The annual wheat systems tended to have higher aboveground total root biomass compared to perennial intermediate wheatgrass however  these results were not significant  Root to shoot ratios were significantly higher  P    0 05  in the perennial systems compared to the annual wheat systems  indicating that perennial roots invest more to belowground biomass than their annual counterparts  Labile soil C fraction  POXC  was significantly higher in perennial intermediate wheatgrass compared to annual wheat under conventional management  P   0 05   However  under organic management  POXC values were higher in annual systems compared to perennial systems  This shows the complexity of management interactions with plant species type  and the potential of novel perennial cereals to sequester C over time       
Spatial variability of soil carbon storage and root production in conventional and perennial agroecosystems Agricultural management may substantially influence regional carbon  C  cycling  particularly with anticipated shifts to cellulosic bioenergy production  Data quantifying ecosystem processes driving soil C storage such as root productivity of bioenergy crops and their impacts on soil organic matter  SOM  pools are critical for development of a sustainable bioeconomy  Characterizing the complex interactions between edaphic factors and the root #8208 SOM continuum at landscape scales is a critical gap that must be addressed to meet these data needs  In this study we use a topographic gradient to investigate how variation in soil properties influences belowground processes to improve knowledge of ecosystem C flow at landscape scales  Our objective was to determine the variation in C inputs from root production and the subsequent changes in soil aggregation and POM pools over three years in response to heterogeneity in edaphic conditions  Using root ingrowth cores  we measured annual root production to 20 cm soil depth within continuous corn  a triticale/sorghum double crop  and switchgrass  We quantified soil aggregation and particulate organic matter  POM  pools in 2009 during the first growing season and again in 2012 to determine changes in response to C inputs from root production over three years Our results show that in 2009  following decades of corn soybean production and prior to the establishment of bioenergy crops  soil properties varied across the topographic gradient  Soil aggregation was higher   P   0 05  on the toeslope and floodplain  and decreased in upslope positions  Levels of POM varied with soil aggregation across landscape positions  Root production differed among the three cropping systems  with the highest production under switchgrass and the lowest with continuous corn  Root productivity in the annual crops was not influenced by soil properties  however switchgrass root production was associated with greater soil sand content  which explained 44% of the variation  Percent sand was correlated  R 2    0 7  with low soil C and nitrogen and high bulk density that were also significant predictors of switchgrass root production  Over three years  changes in soil aggregation and POM pools were significantly correlated with greater root productivity  however these changes were not consistent across landscape positions  These results indicate the importance of both cropping system and soil properties on changes in SOM with conversion to bioenergy  Quantifying these interactions can improve C cycling modeling efforts  allowing for more accurate scaling of measurements to predictions over broad spatial scales       
 Scale dependent patterns of soil microbial abundance  diversity and function in an agricultural landscape  The examination of spatial patterns in ecology is needed to better understand ecosystem processes and to further model development  In soil  microorganisms drive important ecosystem processes but spatial variation of microbial processes results from biotic and abiotic properties that operate at multiple scales  Therefore  the interpretation of microbially mediated ecosystem processes can be misleading because correlations at one scale may be obscured by contrasting correlation at other scales  The objective of this study was to quantify scale specific patterns associated with microbial biomass  bacterial diversity  16S rRNA   and specific functional groups of microbes  To do this  we sampled a transect that ran upslope from uncultivated switchgrass to cultivated corn  Wavelet transformations were used to decompose the data into a set of wavelet coefficients that capture the variance in a single variable and correlations between two variables at defined locations and scales  We hypothesized that the strength and direction of relationships between microorganisms and soil properties is scale dependent and that the magnitude of these relationships is unique to different phylogenetic and functional groups  We also hypothesized that scale dependent correlations between microbes and the soil environment are not uniform across the transect  but change  reflecting differences in factors most limiting to different microbial groups The largest contribution to the variance in microbial biomass was associated with the finest spatial scales  2 4 meters  and appears to be driven by dissolved organic carbon  a labile microbial substrate  This is in contrast to the relationship between microbial biomass and soil moisture  which increased in strength from fine to coarse scales and reflects larger scale constraints on the microbial environment  Significant changes in wavelet variance were also identified at the transition from switchgrass to corn  demonstrating the importance of rhizosphere inputs to the distribution of microbial biomass  Greater variation of microbial biomass in the switchgrass portion of the transect suggests that the extensive perennial root network supports a greater abundance and/or diversity of microorganisms   These data  coupled with deep sequencing of 16S rRNA  will provide insights in to scale specific drivers of microbial biogeography across an agricultural landscape       
Linking microbial community composition to management relevant agroecosystem functions High throughput molecular methods for taxonomic and functional characterization have revolutionized microbial ecology  In soils  these approaches have altered our understanding of the abundance and relevance of many groups  notably the Archaea  As the technology behind detection methods matures  research emphasis has shifted from describing microbial communities and their components to attempting to link this information to management relevant functions  Rapid growth in sequencing capabilities now makes it possible to describe communities in terms of the abundance and diversity of genes involved in key processes such as nitrogen cycling and the digestion of chemically stable forms of carbon  The practical motivations for much of this work are to identify modes of action for achieving management objectives and to develop measures for assessing changes in agroecosystem function  We present research linking microbial community composition to nitrous oxide fluxes from bioenergy feedstock cropping systems  We use PLFA profiles as well as metagenomic sequencing targeting the V6 8 region of the SSU and the nosZ gene to characterize divergence in microbial communities across these systems  We also relate these genetic metrics to in field nitrous oxide flux measurements and to inorganic nitrogen pools in the context of site specific responses to abiotic drivers of denitrification Preliminary results largely focus on the biological signal strength available for identifying quantitative relationships between microbial community composition and nitrous oxide fluxes  In particular  we explore differences in PLFA and functional gene characteristics between no till corn and a low input/high diversity mixture of prairie species  3 to 5 years after establishment       
Managing for fungi in agroecosystems  What we know and where we will go As drivers of biogeochemical processes including decomposition  nutrient cycling  and carbon sequestration  fungi are an important component of the belowground portion of agroecosystems  Many fungi have beneficial roles in agroecosystems and serve as a link between above  and below ground processes by enhancing plant nutrient and water acquisition  Others act as pathogens that cause significant crop and economic losses  Although fungi have been studied in agroecosystems for decades  we are only now beginning to grasp the taxonomic diversity and functional capabilities of soil fungi  As we work towards developing management practices to support belowground processes  we must also continue to develop the means to properly monitor and assess the structure and function of fungal communities A host of new molecular and bioinformatic tools offer unparalleled opportunities for examining belowground communities  However  many of these tools  including nucleotide reference databases  are optimized for bacteria  While there are considerable obstacles in modifying these tools to study fungi  they hold great potential for addressing how management practices influence fungal diversity and functional capabilities  Methods such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics can be used to elucidate the diversity of species present in belowground ecosystems and monitor their activity in regards to the uptake of water and nutrients  Additionally  these new technologies can be used to monitor molecular level interactions between fungi and host plants as these novel tools can identify the presence and activity of agronomic crop genes regulating mycorrhizal symbiosis and/or pathogen defense  This presentation will discuss advantages  disadvantages  and challenges of current and emerging methods and how they can be used to study the structure and function of fungal communities in agroecosystems       
 Perennial crops reduce inorganic recalcitrant P pools and increase reliance on active organic P relative to annual crops in long term experiments at Rothamsted  U K  In agriculture there are two widely recognized avenues of phosphorus  P  loss that make it challenging to maintain adequate levels of soil available P  the intentional export of P from agroecosystems in crop harvests  and the unintentional losses of P via surface runoff and leaching  A third avenue of P   loss     the reduction in available P due to   fixation   or high energy bonding by iron and aluminum oxides    has historically not been considered a problem of agriculture per se  but simply a soil reaction with great consequences  We investigated whether annual agriculture amplifies the proportion of P held in recalcitrant  inorganic pools by comparing how perennial pasture crops and annual wheat crops influenced the distribution of soil P in labile and recalcitrant as well as organic  Po  and inorganic  Pi  forms  We undertook detailed P fractionations and microbial P fumigation/extraction procedures on four soil depths spanning 0 92cm from the Broadbalk continuous wheat  annual since 1843  and Parkgrass hay meadow  perennial since 1856  experiments at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden  UK  We also analyzed archived soils that were sampled from Broadbalk in 1893 and Parkgrass in 1876  We found that both P fertilized and unfertilized soils appear to maintain an inverse relationship between pool sizes of actively cycling Po  0 5M bicarbonate and 0 1M NaOH  and recalcitrant Pi  hot conc  HCl + final digest  with Po dominant in the perennial hay meadow and recalcitrant Pi dominant in the annual wheat  Recalcitrant Pi was shown to be plant available over time in both unfertilized wheat and hay meadow crops  Microbial biomass P in the surface horizons of fertilized and unfertilized perennial hay meadow was an order of magnitude greater than in annual wheat  These results and others suggest that compared to annual wheat  herbaceous perennials maintain a lower proportion of native and fertilizer P in recalcitrant inorganic forms and a greater proportion in relatively available organic forms       
Bottom up effects of conventional and organic soil fertility management on Ostrinia nubilalis development and resistance of corn plants to herbivory Under USDA National Organic Program certification standards  farmers rely partly on soil nutrient management practices to suppress insect pests  Consequently  a growing body of literature has investigated relationships between crop nutrient profiles and insect herbivore response  One practice  known as the basic cation saturation ratio  or soil balance  BAL  concept  maintains that altering soil calcium and magnesium ratios facilitates nutrient uptake by crops  optimizing yield and reducing herbivorous insect damage  However  we found in a greenhouse experiment that the European corn borer   Ostrinia nubilalis   preferentially oviposits on plants reared in organic BAL soil over plants reared in soil farmed using standard organic  STD  practices and conventionally farmed  CONV  soil  To test larval response of O  nubilalis to corn reared in different soils  and to test the resilience of these plants to increasing herbivory  we collected the three soil types from plots in Arlington  WI  which have employed these soil fertility management systems in a corn soybean alfalfa rotation for at least 4 years  Corn plants were reared to maturity in the three soil types in a greenhouse  after which each plant was infested with 0 40 O  nubilalis larvae for 17 days  Larval performance and proportion of kernels damaged were then assessed per plant  Ostrinia nubilalis exhibited signs of competitive stress  with proportion survival and mean development stage of the larvae significantly decreasing as a function of increased infestation  Mean development stage was significantly higher in larvae consuming BAL reared plants than in larvae on STD plants  with CONV showing intermediate larval development  However  there was no significant interaction of survival or development stage with increasing larval density among soil types  Proportion of kernels damaged per corn plant significantly increased as a function in increasing O  nubilalis density  but this relationship was not significantly different among soil types  Total yield of the corn plants that had not been infested also did not significantly differ  These results refute the basic cation saturation ratio hypothesis  as plants reared in the BAL soil type failed to produce higher yields in the absence of O  nubilalis  and actually hastened development rate of O  nubilalis larvae compared to the STD soil type without reducing their larval/pupal mass or survivorship  The relationships between these results and both soil and plant tissue nutrients will also be discussed       
Consequences of agricultural management intensity for litter inhabiting arthropods and their role in decomposition The importance of arthropods for ecological services in managed ecosystems cannot be overstated  and their roles as pollinators  predators and parasitoids have been well documented  Yet  our understanding of the roles that arthropods play in litter decomposition  and the functional importance of litter inhabiting arthropods in agricultural systems remains uncertain  This uncertainty is intensified by a poor understanding of the factors which regulate the size and composition of arthropod communities in decomposing litter  Thus  there is great incentive for characterizing the responses of arthropod communities to agricultural management intensity and determining the functional importance of these responses  A 730 day litter decomposition study was conducted to explore the impacts of soil management intensity and resource quality on litter inhabiting arthropods during long term decomposition  Variation in litter mass loss and chemistry was also assessed to identify key links between arthropod communities and litter chemical transformations during litter decay   Within five days of decomposition  total arthropod density reached roughly 200 individuals per gram of litter  Arthropod densities varied considerably over time and were heavily influenced by management intensity and litter type  In contrast to the typical response of soil dwelling arthropods  arthropod densities in decomposing litter increased with management intensity  The densities of many arthropod taxa also responded negatively to initial litter carbon to nitrogen ratio  C N   and temporal variation in arthropod communities during decomposition corresponded with shifts in precipitation and litter chemistry  Additionally  the importance of management intensity for structuring arthropod communities in litter varied by litter type  For example  collembolan densities were sensitive to management intensity when colonizing grass litter  C N    18   but not corn litter  C N    60   Thus  management intensity is an important factor structuring arthropod communities in decomposing litter  and temporal shifts in arthropod communities during decomposition result from interactions between management intensity  litter quality  and climate  Relationships between arthropod densities  mass loss rates  and litter chemistry reveal that variation in arthropod communities can lead to significant physico chemical shifts during decomposition which may have long term consequences for soil organic matter formation and stability       
Representing belowground processes in land surface models  Applications at the regional scale and remaining challenges Land surface models were originally developed to act as a boundary for global climate models  Without representation of the exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and land surface  atmospheric processes could not be accurately simulated  Over time  representation of vegetation processes and the carbon cycle further improved simulations of the climate  Today  these models are used to analyze a number of global environmental issues including the carbon sequestration potential of ecosystems  ecosystem response to climate change  and land use and land cover change effects on ecosystem goods and services  Several decades of satellite observations of the land surface along with global networks of measurements including FLUXNET and LTER provide a means to evaluate how aboveground processes are simulated in these models  however  less attention has been given to below ground processes  One reason the simulation of belowground processes is challenging results from the dearth of observations  satellites cannot directly measure below the surface and field observations are sparse  Furthermore  when observations are available  it is difficult to know how well they might scale regionally  It is especially challenging to represent the physics of belowground processes across a large domain in land surface models  For example  soil temperature is an important variable for many plant soil processes  but it is difficult to simulate  Results from the simulation of agroecosystems using one model  Agro IBIS  show that soil temperature is biased after harvest because the model simulates a completely bare soil rather than a more realistic surface that includes plant residue  This bias in soil temperature affects the simulated surface energy budget and carbon budget through its effects on microbial respiration  This is less of a challenge in perennial grass systems used for bioenergy as the soil surface is covered by vegetation for most of the year  however  simulation results show that low vegetation cover during establishment of miscanthus results in low biases in simulated soil temperature  which hinders establishment across large areas of the Midwest U S  Soil temperature can be increased through the addition of a simulated residue layer  Water and nitrogen use are also important below ground components of land surface models  Results will be presented that highlight the model  s ability to simulate differences in water use efficiency and nitrate loss from the soil among different food and bioenergy crops       
Using plant traits to predict reintroduction success of endangered species Reintroduction of endangered species may be necessary to protect them from extinction  provide connectivity between populations  and reach recovery goals under the U S  Endangered Species Act  But what factors affect reintroduction success  Here I propose that there are traits of endangered species that make them more likely to succeed in reintroductions  Specifically  reintroduction success will be highest for endangered species that share traits with non rare native species  invasives  and species that excel in restoration projects  I synthesized the results of six review papers that evaluated traits associated with plant rarity  invasiveness  and successful restoration planting and identified traits common to more than one group to generate a short list of traits that could predict reintroduction success  To test the usefulness of these traits  I compared reintroduced plant performance  first year survival  of seven plant species from prairies of western Oregon with the number of traits hypothesized to be linked to reintroduction success for each using polynomial regression Based on traits in common with rarity  invasiveness  and/or establishment during restoration  I hypothesize that the following plant characteristics may indicate the likelihood of successful reintroduction  1  long flowering fruiting period  2  vegetative growth  3  competitive ability  including plants that are tall and/or with high leaf area   4  high seed production and/or intermediate seed size  5  long distance dispersal mechanism  6  large geographic range and/or multiple habitats  and 7  generalist pollination and mixed mating system  Because of its strong association with invasion potential  an additional trait  8  past history of success  is added to this list  First year survival of reintroduced plants was positively correlated with the number of these traits in the seven species examined  more than 50% of variability in survival was explained by the number of predictor traits possessed by each species   These results imply that plant species that are most likely to succeed in reintroduction programs may be predicted from their inherent traits  Species with few traits linked to reintroduction potential may need additional support to succeed  such as close matching to needed habitat  intensive site preparation  and development of rigorous propagation protocols       
Comparative demography of reintroductions and wild populations to evaluate restorations and test ecological hypotheses Although plant introductions are often performed and evaluated in an idiosyncratic manner  experimental introductions can be coupled with careful evaluation to provide tests of specific hypotheses related to introduction methods or ecological concepts  Here  we adopt a comparative method to evaluate the success of introductions in relation to wild populations  comparing vital rates of introduced to wild plants for three species with a range of life histories  Cirsium pitcheri is a semelparous forb native to dynamic sand dune ecosystems in the Great Lakes  Lomatium cookii is a long lived forb native to Pacific Northwest grasslands  and Ziziphus celata is a long lived clonal shrub of sandhill ecosystems in central Florida  For each species  long term demographic monitoring     10 years  provides context for evaluating multiple experimental introductions over many years  We perform analyses of vital rates  annual survival  annual growth  transitions to reproduction or reproductive size  in relation to introduction status  introduced vs  wild   year  and life history stage  We hypothesize that introduced plants may have greater vital rates due to targeting of suitable planting sites and initial care  but that this advantage will be minimal in longer lived species that cannot reach reproductive size until well after outplanting Introduced plants had higher survival than wild plants for Cirsium and similar survival for Ziziphus   For Cirsium   survival decreased with successional stage  Lomatium survival interacted with stage such that only smaller introduced plants had higher survival than wild plants  Annual growth had different patterns  it was relatively low for introduced Cirsium plants and interacted with life history stage for Ziziphus   Transitions to reproductive size were more frequent for introduced than wild plants for Cirsium but the opposite was true for Ziziphus and Lomatium   After nearly a decade in some introduced populations  reproduction is still rare for Ziziphus  in contrast to the two forbs  which rapidly completed life cycles and produced a new generation of recruits  For all species  survival increased and growth decreased with size or stage  both varied among years  Our comparisons of vital rates of introduced plants with wild plants show that these introductions have been fairly successful  especially in producing comparative survival  but that growth and reproduction have often lagged  Constraints on ex situ plant development as well as habitat quality at the reintroduction site may slow plant and population growth after introductions  These results give context to experimental introductions and suggest ways of improving the success of future introductions       
Where you  ve been and where you  re going  Seed source and reintroduction success Genetic background of seed source can have a major impact on reintroduction success due to breeding system  genetic variation and local adaptation  Use of multiple versus single seed sources for restoration is of concern due to the potential for outbreeding depression  Low genetic diversity of the source population may reduce reintroduction success  Also  local adaptation can result in a mismatch between the source plant material and the reintroduction site  We address these issues using four herbaceous perennials from a variety of genetic backgrounds  including inbred and outbred planned crosses in an orchid   Platanthera leucophaea    between population crosses of a prairie forb with self incompatibility   Asclepias meadii    naturally low and high genetic variability of a monocarpic dune plant   Cirsium pitcheri    and intense edaphic differentiation in populations of a local endemic   Lomatium cookii   Crossing experiments using P  leucophaea   revealed that progeny from flowers that were selfed had significantly lower seed viability and germination compared to outcrossed seeds  Lack of evidence for outbreeding depression was indicated by no difference between intrapopulation and interpopulation outcrossing  Potential hybrid vigor was revealed by seedlings from interpopulation crosses having greater growth than those from intrapopulation crosses for A  meadii   For C  pitcheri   plants from a source population with low genetic diversity were smaller and had lower survival compared to other source populations with higher genetic diversity  However  reintroduction success projected using population viability analysis did not differ among seed sources  apparently because lower survival of plants from the low genetic diversity population was compensated for by higher growth and fecundity in later stages  Populations of L  cookii occur in widely different habitat types  including wetland and upland sites and serpentine and non serpentine soils  When seeds from a non serpentine source were planted with seeds from a local source on serpentine soils  germination was similar for both seed types  ~15%  but seedlings from local seed had much lower mortality than those from nonlocal seeds  4% vs  32%   as did small juvenile plants  12% vs  22%   Local adaptation may have strong effects on reintroduction success if habitats differ between the seed source and the reintroduction site  Genetic background  whether from manipulated crosses or population history  can have strong effects on reintroduced population vital rates and overall performance       
Sustainable rare plant populations  Factors influencing probability and timing of next generation recruitment For the 33 000 plant species estimated to be at risk of extinction worldwide  reintroduction is often suggested as a conservation strategy  The design and creation of reintroduced populations that are resilient to environmental change requires understanding the factors that influence population establishment  Using a sample of 102 rare plant reintroductions that were known to be extant in 2012 and have had second generation recruitment  we asked whether life history  maturation rate  founder population size  or life form influenced the probability and timing of second generation establishment  Using logistic regression with time since outplanting as a covariate  we examined the influence of four variables on the probability of second generation establishment  In addition we regressed maturation rate against time to next generation  Not surprisingly  a significantly higher probability of second generation establishment occurred in short lived  rapidly maturing taxa than for long lived taxa  The probability of producing a second generation increased as founder population size increased  suggesting that many reintroductions are prone to founder effects  Species with longer maturation times had significantly greater lag times until next generation establishment than species with short maturation times  Preliminary findings indicate that even species with 1 4 yr maturation times required up to 4   8 years to establish next generation  Perennials requiring   10 years to achieve reproductive maturity represented 25% of our sample and are not expected to establish second generation for decades  These results have important implications for improving plant reintroductions  First  to improve the probability of long term population sustainability  we recommend that practitioners consider as large a founder population size as feasible for the species  Second  expecting reintroduced populations of all taxa to show bench marks of high survival  reproduction  and second generation recruitment within a short time frame is biologically unrealistic  Finally  reintroduction plans should consider monitoring efforts on the scale of decades to measure success rates at time scales relevant to plant life histories       
Plant reintroductions as demographic genetic experiments Plant conservation practice increasingly involves population reinforcement and reintroductions  a o  to counter detrimental genetic effects of habitat fragmentation  The consequences of these actions for population viability parameters are rarely monitored  however  We have studied effects of population reinforcement experiments on levels of genetic diversity and reproductive success in the self incompatible plant Arnica montana   We compared genetic diversity with AFLP markers  population size and seed set between 15 Dutch populations sampled in 2000 and again in 2012  Five of these populations became extinct during this period  We hypothesize that  i  extinct populations were smaller  and had lower genetic diversity and seed set than extant populations   ii  populations to which individuals from other populations were added increased their size  genetic diversity and seed set   iii  genetic diversity and seed set declined in the small populations that were not reinforced  and  iv  large populations still had high levels of genetic diversity and good seed set There were substantial differences in genetic diversity  population size and seed set between extinct  reinforced and non reinforced  natural  populations  For the extant populations  there were also significant differences between samples from 2000 and 2012  As compared to extant populations  the extinct populations were significantly smaller and had lower genetic diversity in 2000  In contrast to natural populations  gene diversity of reinforced populations increased slightly  population size increased dramatically and they had much higher seed set in 2012 as compared to 2000  In conclusion  the reinforcement of A  montana populations has boosted their viability after 12 years  Even though genetic diversity for the AFLP markers increased only to a minor extent  population size and reproductive success increased dramatically  whereas other populations went extinct or remained stable at best  Because A  montana is long lived and clonal  however  even in 12 years too few generations will have passed to detect outbreeding depression  Our study demonstrates that populations that were relatively small  genetically poor and consequently had low reproductive success had a higher probability of extinction       
Translocations as bioassays of recent environmental change	  Conservation translocation is an umbrella term for any deliberate movement of plants or animals for conservation purposes and includes reintroductions where the recipient site is within the species   indigenous range  and conservation introductions  C I   which involve moving individuals beyond the range  Reintroductions are regularly used for threatened species management but with mixed success  Poor post translocation survival might occur because recipient sites are only superficially like those supporting extant populations and practitioners do not account for the potential for recent climate change to have rendered parts of the former range unsuitable  In a meta analysis of plant translocations  reintroductions resulted in higher mortality than C I  Whilst this is based on a very small sample of C I  attempts  it suggests that failed reintroductions might be attributable to recent climate change whilst successful C I  could indicate a shift in the spatial distribution of suitable climatic conditions beyond the species   former range  Discriminant function analysis was used to explore the relative importance of a wide range of factors associated with the success of plant reintroduction and C I  attempts  Specifically  this analysis identifies the key variables that discriminate between successful and failed translocation attempts through multivariate comparison of the species   indigenous range  A database of   300 plant translocations were identified during a systematic review completed in 2011 and are currently being analysed  Preliminary results indicate that small scale factors such as site specific management often play a critical role in affecting the success of plant translocations  However  in many cases  climatic factors are identified as being important and in particular  variables associated with water availability are key to post translocation survival  In addition to identifying the signature of climate change  this study has identified gaps in translocation feasibility assessment and monitoring  The presentation concludes by explaining how practitioners can avoid undertaking translocations that succumb to climate impacts and how a well designed monitoring program can enable adaptive management approaches       
Two decades of plant translocations in Western Australia  Assessing success and recovery of threatened species Plant translocations  the movement of plant material for conservation purposes  have been used as part of species recovery programs in Western Australia for the past two decades  In this time the Department of Environment and Conservation translocated 58 taxa to 94 sites  These translocations have predominantly been set up as experiments  under an adaptive management framework  to improve establishment and success rates  This approach has also been used to develop success criteria which can subsequently be applied in a re assessment of the species conservation status  An overarching success criterion for these translocated populations is that they are self sustaining  Only then can they be considered when ranking the conservation status of that species  Many of the species in Western Australia  s translocation program are long lived  take many years to reach maturity  and may take years  or require a disturbance event  before subsequent generations are recruited  This makes developing long term success criteria challenging  Consideration is now being given to surrogate measures such as predictions based on PVA  and benchmarking genetic diversity and mating system estimates of translocated populations against natural populations  Alternatives  such as long term monitoring to confirm self sustainability over multiple generations  are often not possible due to limited resources  In this talk we assess the two decades of data collected from the 94 translocation sites  We discuss the results from the experiments designed to test establishment techniques  in particular the survival and growth data from watering  mulching and vertebrate herbivore exclusion experiments  We examine whether any of our 94 translocations can be considered successful and in light of these reviews  evaluate the appropriateness of our success criteria  We also assess the contribution made by translocated populations to the overall conservation of threatened plant taxa       
Measuring and managing genetic erosion in plant reintroductions Plant reintroductions typically start from a limited genetic base  When that genetic base is known  an opportunity to quantify genetic erosion and test the genetic consequences of small founding population size through generations in a natural experiment is enabled  Long term studies test ecological genetic theory  shed light on the long term consequences of genetic erosion for reintroduction success  and suggest management actions to avoid genetic erosion  The Corrigin Grevillea   G  scapigera   has been the focus of a sustained recovery program for over 20 years  No plants remain in wild populations due to land clearing for agriculture in the Western Australian wheatbelt  The first successful translocation trials were established in 1996 with what were thought to be equal numbers of 10 genets  ramets of which were propagated by tissue culture  as germination from seed was at the time not possible  In this translocation site  subsequent plantings occurred in following years  largely from seed harvested at this site  Flowering and natural seed set has been very high in all years  and some natural recruitment occurred in most years from 2003  In 1998  we genotyped all founding plants and a sample of their seed to assess genetic fidelity and genetic erosion in the first generation  In 2012  we genotyped all surviving plants and a sample of their seed  to quantify genetic erosion over multiple generations  An assessment of inbreeding depression was also conducted by regressing F1 seedling mortality against genetic dissimilarity of their parents Following establishment  we found that  i  eight genets  not ten  were present in the translocated population  and that 54% of all plants were a single genotype   ii  the F1's were on average 22% more inbred and 20% less heterozygous than their parents  largely because  iii  paternity assignment revealed that 85% of all seeds were the product of only four clones  Ultimately  effective population size of the founding population was approximately two  This initial dramatic erosion of genetic variability has strongly impacted the genetic variation present in their descendents 15 years later  Despite good flowering and seed set over most years  a positive association between survivorship and increasing genetic dissimilarity of parents of seedlings indicates inbreeding depression associated with genetic erosion  Our results highlight that rapid genetic erosion may be a feature of many small  translocated populations  which may ultimately threaten their long term survival  Strategies to prevent genetic decline in rare species translocations are discussed       
A metapopulation approach to Examining the effect of restorations on population viability in the Indiana Dunes In order to increase metapopulation viability  new populations of Cirsium pitcheri  a federal threatened dune plant with metapopulation dynamics  was introduced to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in 1994  To determine the degree to which addition of populations affect Cirsium pitcheri metapopulation viability at Indiana Dunes  we use 23 years of demographic data  to quantitatively predict persistence rates through the use of matrix models to simulate the progression of the metapopulation with and without the addition of reintroduced populations  We also use simulations to project how many populations are needed for the metapopulation to persist for a 50 years  Through the comparison of the vital rates between natural and reintroduced populations within the metapopulation via life table response experiments  LTRE   we assess demographic responses on population growth rate   lambda    Lastly  we use elasticity analysis to determine whether natural or reintroduced populations have a greater contribution to the metapopulation growth rate  We expect that Indiana Dunes   Cirsium pitcheri metapopulation viability will improve with the addition of reintroduced populations as compared to without the addition of reintroductions  These analyses aid management decisions through the determination of the number of reintroductions required and how each population improves the metapopulation viability Reintroductions decreased the probability of extinction of the Indiana Dunes C  pitcheri Metapopulation though only by a few years  however  the addition of more populations would not yield a significant increase in population viability  LTRE analyses suggest that population type  native or reintroduced has no significant bearing on the contribution on the growth rate with each individual populations dynamics influenced by differences in their life histories and habitat  Positive contributions of growth transitions to larger plants and negative contributions of fecundity are the driving factors that that have the greatest impacts on the overall metapopulation growth rate  Elasticity analysis of the contributions of the different vital rates to  lambda  shows strong linear relationships between growth and fecundity with population growth rates  In contrast stasis has an inverse relationship with population growth  Overall  the addition of two Cirsium pitcheri populations to Indiana Dunes Metapopulation has improved the viability of the species from a metapopulation perspective       
 Diversifying the composition and structure of managed  late successional forests with harvest gaps  What is the optimal gap size   Managing forests for resilience is crucial in the face of uncertain future environmental conditions  Because harvest gap size alters the species diversity and the vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity  there may be an optimum gap size for conferring resilience to environmental uncertainty  We examined the impacts of different harvest gap sizes on structure and composition in northern hardwood forests of the upper Great Lakes region  USA using a robustly designed experiment consisting of six harvest gap sizes replicated12 times with over a decade of repeated measurements  We asked the following questions  How does gap size influence tree seedling recruitment over time  How does gap size influence tree sapling composition and diversity over time  How does gap size influence sapling layer height development and future canopy composition We found that germinant  trees   0 15 m tall  densities were greatest in year 2  71 6 stems m  2   but were present in all years  0  2  6  and 12 years post harvest   suggesting a continuous influx of tree seedlings on site  Sapling    0 6 m tall  densities were greatest  3 9 stems m  2   in year 12 and were composed primarily of three species already present on site  The 6 and 10 m diameter  dia   harvest gaps had  on average  the minimum number of saplings  ~2 stems m  2   needed to fill small canopy openings  but  by year 12  small gaps were closed by crown extension of mature edge trees  Medium  20 m dia   to large harvest gaps  30 and 46 m dia   had fewer saplings than small gaps  The understory layer of medium and large gaps was dominated by shrubs that dampened growth of some saplings  Consequently  gap filling by saplings would not occur in the near future  and  from a management perspective would be considered a regeneration failure within larger gaps  Our study suggests that the perfect gap size does not exist and using harvest gaps to create resilient forests with structural and compositional diversity alone is challenging on productive habitats       
Young seedling dynamics depend on harvest gap size and surface disturbance Increasing tree regeneration diversity may become an important management objective in decreasingly diverse northern hardwood forests  Land managers may have to rely on natural regeneration to increase seedling diversity as economics often preclude planting seedlings  As such  a greater understanding of the ecological constraints on tree species regeneration is needed  In rich mesic northern hardwood forest in Michigan  USA  we are conducting stand scale experiments aimed at identifying the multiple factors constraining the transition from seed to mature seedling for multiple species  Here we report on the impacts of harvest gap size  competing vegetation and scarification  exposure of mineral soil  on young seedling dynamics  In plots located in each of 40 harvest gaps  0 2500m 2   and four unharvested areas  four sub plots  2m 2   were located per plot and assigned a 2x2 factorial of surface scarified/not scarified and non tree competing vegetation removed     clipped /not removed  Five hundred seeds of Betula alleghaniensis  hereafter Ba with similar acronyms for other species   B  papyrifera   Tsuga canadensis   and Pinus strobus were added to each sub plot to augment the natural seed rain/seed bank  We examined the effect of the treatments and light availability through GLM mixed models using poisson logarithmic linear regression for germination   and a binomial logistic linear regression for survival First year germination was unaffected by competing vegetation  for which % cover averaged 29% in unclipped plots  Scarification had strong positive impacts on the germination of light seeded   Bp   Yb   and Tc   but not heavier seeded species   Fraxinus americana   Acer saccharum    For Fa and As   germination was negatively affected by high light availability  First year survival increased with increasing light for Ps  Ba  Fa and Tc   whereas Bp survival decreased with increasing light and competing vegetation density  In contrast  competing vegetation increased sugar maple survival  For second year survival  low light availability continued to negatively impact Tc and Fa   while competing vegetation continued to negatively affect Bp   Collectively  these results suggest that for this group of species  scarified medium sized harvest gaps  900m 2   support relatively high seedling densities for the greatest number of species  Scarification greatly enhances light seeded species germination  Bp 16x  Ba 94x  Tc 12x greater p   0001    Medium sized gaps provide a combination of high enough light to ameliorate low light mortality  Ps  34   Ba  30   Fa  29   and Tc  34  % increase in survival in medium compared to small gaps  p    05   but not so high that germination of heavier seeded species or the survival of As or Pb is strongly adversely affected       
Influence of legacy tree retention on regeneration dynamics and harvest opening persistence in northern hardwoods We examined the influence of initial opening size and legacy tree retention on regeneration dynamics and opening persistence in a well replicated  long term silvicultural experiment  Forty nine harvest gaps with a centrally retained yellow birch   Betula alleghaniensis   and twenty closed canopy reference sites were established during the winter of 2003/04 at the Ford Research Forest near Alberta  MI  Opening and legacy tree attributes and regeneration response were measured in 2004/05 and 2011/12  In addition to plot sampling  the location of each yellow birch and eastern hemlock   Tsuga canadensis   in the regenerating cohort was mapped in 2012 Projections based on observed gap closure rates suggest that openings    500 m 2 should persist long enough for mid tolerant tree species to successfully recruit into the overstory  Centrally located legacy trees had only a minor impact on opening longevity of these larger gaps  Full crown release of legacy trees resulted in minimal mortality  1 17% year  1   and nearly a 3 fold increase in diameter increment  Results of a nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination indicated that tree species composition across the wide range of opening sizes examined  200 1460 m 2   was surprisingly similar  with most openings dominated by shade tolerant maples   Acer spp    Yellow birch densities  however  did increase with opening size  A plot by plot comparison of 2005 and 2012 yellow birch occurrences indicated that only 32% of the plots where yellow birch occurred in 2005 still contained yellow birch regeneration  while the number of plots with yellow birch remained virtually unchanged  14 vs  12%   Since inception the region has been plagued by growing season droughts which are likely responsible for the high initial mortality of yellow birch seedlings  The complete census and mapping of yellow birch and eastern hemlock in 2012 suggests that cool southerly gap edges and microsites in the shadow of the legacy tree crown are the most conducive to the growth and survival of these species given current climatic conditions  Our results highlight the contingent role of abiotic conditions and initial species composition on the success or failure of silvicultural treatments designed to promote tree species diversity in managed uneven aged forests       
Assessing the efficacy of natural disturbance based harvest gaps at restoring old growth composition and structure	  Over the past two decades  an increasing emphasis has been placed on developing forest management prescriptions that are modeled after the severity and frequency of natural disturbances for a given region  These approaches have been recommended as a coarse filter strategy for maintaining native biodiversity in managed landscapes  as well as a potential tool for restoring old growth structural and compositional attributes to the simplified second growth forests that predominate over most areas  The objective of this research was to determine the effects of several natural disturbance based restoration treatments and browsing by white tailed deer on tree regeneration  understory community composition  and structure in second growth northern hardwood forests in northern Wisconsin  Community composition and tree regeneration were measured in stands with six different silvicultural treatments replicated across three large study areas     50 ha   Treatments consisted of a combination of two levels of coarse woody debris and three canopy gap treatments designed to emulate patterns of natural canopy disturbance  small gaps  10 7m diameter   medium gaps  18 3 and 24 4m diameter   and a meso scale wind disturbance treatment consisting of 0 4 and 1 2 ha shelterwoods  All treatments included multiple small  25 m 2   deer exclosures to examine the impacts of deer herbivory  Assessment of cover by herbaceous plants and seedlings indicated that canopy gap treatments had a much larger effect on understory community composition than browsing by deer  whereas there was no effect of coarse wood levels  Species richness was highest in the small gaps treatment and lowest in the control stands  possibly reflecting the dominance of larger gap treatments by grasses and Rubus spp  Seedling density increased with increasing canopy removal and large canopy gaps and the meso scale wind disturbance treatment served to recruit historically important mid tolerant species  including Betula alleghaniensis   Sapling dynamics followed a similar pattern  however  herbivory impacts on sapling composition and structure were much more pronounced than in the seedling and understory layers  In particular  sapling densities of mid tolerant tree species were significantly greater in exclosures illustrating the pervasive effects sustained deer browsing may have on limiting opportunities for restoring compositional diversity to the canopy layer of second growth systems  These results underscore the utility of natural disturbance based treatments at increasing the complexity of second growth tree regeneration and understory communities and the importance of accounting for herbivory impacts on treatment responses       
 Experimental gaps in the Vermont Forest Ecosystem Management Demonstration Project  Effects on stand dynamics  salamanders  understory plants  and fungi  Management for late successional forest structure and function is an important element of sustainable forestry in the northern hardwood region  Canopy gaps are a key characteristic of interest and a variety of silvicultural approaches have been proposed to approximate natural canopy gap dynamics  The Vermont Forest Ecosystem Management Demonstration Project is assessing long term responses to different sizes and spatial distributions of silvicultural gaps  We are testing an approach called   Structural Complexity Enhancement    SCE  in which variable density horizontal structure  including small gaps  0 02 ha mean   is an explicit objective  SCE is compared against other modified uneven aged approaches  including single tree selection and group selection with legacy tree retention within larger gaps  0 05 ha mean   The study is replicated at two research areas in Vermont  U S A  Manipulations and controls were applied to 2 ha units and replicated four times per treatment  Structural objectives for SCE included multi layered canopies  elevated large snag and downed coarse woody debris  CWD  densities  variable horizontal density  gapiness   and re allocation of basal area to larger diameter classes  Accelerated growth in larger trees is also promoted through crown release  achieved by clustering small gaps around selected dominant canopy trees  On some units  small gaps  root wads  pits  and downed CWD are created simultaneously by pulling or pushing trees over mechanically  Vegetation data were collected over two years pre treatment and seven years post treatment  Salamander and fungi surveys were conducted several years post harvest Crown release in dominant canopy trees distributed adjacent to or within small gaps is predicted to increase large tree recruitment over the next 50 years based on simulation modeling  Tree regeneration has been strongly influenced by competition with ferns and shrubs  All treatments were successful in maintaining overall richness and/or abundance of understory plants  salamanders  and fungi  Statistical model results show that over time  understory plant responses were strongly affected by overstory treatment and less influenced by soil chemistry and drought stress  However  diversity for sensitive  late successional herbaceous plants increased significantly in SCE units and decreased significantly in the semi open canopied conditions within group selection units  Fungi and salamander responses were strongly associated with microsite characteristics  particularly CWD  and increased significantly  p    0 05  under SCE  but showed no statistically significant decrease in gaps created by group selection in comparison to controls  The results suggest that a variety of small gap and group selection with retention techniques can help maintain a range of biodiversity in managed forests       
Influence of retention trees on regeneration dynamics in expanding gap shelterwood treatments in the Acadian forest	  Gap based silvicultural systems may offer an important approach for foresters and other resource managers who wish to adopt regeneration methods mimicking natural forest disturbance patterns and processes  particularly within systems in which disturbance dynamics are characterized by low intensity and long return intervals  Given their relatively brief history in North America  however  basic questions remain about the utility of such systems in establishing and promoting the growth of desirable mixtures of tree regeneration  We examined spatial patterns in regeneration composition in the context of the Acadian Forest Ecosystem Research Program  AFERP   a long term gap based silvicultural experiment with treatments designed to emulate the annual 1% disturbance frequency found throughout the northeastern United States and Canada  We attempted to quantify the impact of retention trees and proximity to the untreated matrix on the composition and development of regeneration within harvest gaps  testing the hypothesis that sapling and regeneration density and composition are dependent on spatial relationships to retention trees and harvest gap edges  We used detrended correspondence analysis to characterize regeneration and sapling plots  looking at changes in ordination patterns based on spatial position  From our analysis  it is apparent that abundant regeneration of all dominant tree species can be found within harvest gaps  though balsam fir and red maple dominate the new cohort  and patterns of composition vary spatially       
Microclimate and regeneration discordance in harvest gaps of mixed species stands	  Harvesting multiple tree gaps has become a current strategy for natural regeneration in many forests types  especially when both producing forest goods and emulating natural disturbances dynamics are desired  Harvest gaps can be used in different variants of silvicultural systems  such as selection cutting and shelterwood  In northern ecosystems  use of harvest gaps must take into account an important factor  the latitude  Over the 40 deg N parallel for instance  the distribution of light in gaps is asymmetrical and the zone of maximum light is offset to the northern part compared to the equator  This asymmetry can cause theoretically a discordance between the optimal ecological niches for regeneration and growth  Since gaps are used to satisfy regeneration requirements of desired species  how does it affect regeneration dynamics in practice  Results drawn from two experiments of patch selection cutting in the province of Quebec  Canada  will be presented  The Maniwaki study was located in the northern hardwoods forest zone  46 deg N  76 deg W  and aimed at regenerating eastern white pine   Pinus strobus L   and birches   Betula spp   in a mixed tolerant hardwoods    white pine stand  The SSAM study  Silvicultural Systems Adapted to Mixedwood forest  was set in the temperate mixedwood forest zone  47 deg N  72 deg W  and conducted in yellow birch   Betula alleghaniensis Britton     conifer stands for regenerating yellow birch  red spruce   Picea rubens Sarg   and balsam fir   Abies balsamea [L ] Mill    Besides regeneration abundance  light and temperature were measured in both experiments for assessing microclimate variation within gaps  As expected  the Maniwaki study showed an asymmetry in light distribution in 40 m circular gaps  The effects on microclimate and patterns of natural regeneration were not only observed along a north    south gradient  but on a west    east gradient too  Moreover  there was evidence of discordance between regeneration and growth niches for white pine  The SSAM study has also underlined evidences of niches discordance for yellow birch and conifer species  since borders were important regeneration niches  while the northern part of gaps had the best light conditions  Instead of being viewed negatively  discordances of regeneration and growth niches can be considered as an opportunity to create different ecological conditions to regenerate a diversity of species  A good understanding of regeneration dynamics in and around gaps is necessary to adapt gap sizes and silvicultural systems to the specificity of mixed stands       
Sustaining forest diversity amidst the interacting forces of northern temperate forests	    Disruptions to historic disturbance and browsing regimes have altered plant species composition and diversity in forests worldwide  In deciduous forests of North America  three widespread changes appear central to this phenomenon  Fire frequency is reduced  canopy gaps are smaller  and browsers are more abundant  We conducted a large scale experiment near the geographic center of eastern deciduous forests to test the hypothesis that once common disturbances and their interaction with the top down influence of browsers can create conditions favorable for the maintenance of diverse woody and herbaceous communities in forest understories  We tested this hypothesis in two parallel experiments employing a factorial design wherein we manipulated canopy gaps  present/absent   low intensity understory fire  burned/unburned   and manipulations of white tailed deer browsing  fenced/unfenced    Fire  large canopy gaps  and browsing all dramatically affected understory composition and interactions among all factors were pervasive  Under gaps  recruitment of less shade tolerant species to the community moderately increased seedling and sapling abundance  richness  and diversity under ambient browsing  However  when browsers were excluded from gaps  woody species density  richness and diversity more than doubled  Fire effect on seedling and sapling density  richness  or diversity depended entirely on its interaction with gap formation and browsing and created contrasting seedling and sapling communities  Prunus pensylvanica dominated in burned plots protected from browsers whereas Betula spp  and Acer pensylvanicum dominated in burned plots with browsers present  Effects of disturbance on the herbaceous community were generally comparable  Canopy gaps and fire each increased herbaceous richness and abundance and the response was amplified when these disturbances co occurred  In stark contrast to woody species  herbaceous richness in disturbed areas with ambient browsing was nearly doubled relative to areas protected from browsing  Specifically  deer browsing indirectly increased forb and fern richness in disturbed areas by reducing the abundance of highly palatable and fast growing shrubs that proliferated following disturbance  Our study demonstrates synergies between canopy gaps and understory fire can promote diverse understory plant assemblages and these effects are often modified by browsing  Although speculative  our results suggest harvest gaps may be an appropriate management strategy to sustain and enhance plant biodiversity  However  the efficacy and outcomes of this practice will often depend on additional co occurring forces and potentially vary among plant growth forms       
Variation in biotic linkages with slope aspect in a temperate hardwood forest Plant ecologists have long been interested in aspect related contrasts of montane forests  with most studies focusing on north  versus south facing slopes and on differences in overstory and herbaceous layer communities  far less emphasis has been placed on soil microbial communities  The purpose of this study was to assess quantitative differences in plant and soil microbial communities between northeast  NE    and southwest  SW   facing slopes in a second growth hardwood forest in western West Virginia  We addressed three questions   1  how do soil microbial  herbaceous layer  and overstory communities vary with slope aspect   2  do forest vegetation strata and soil microbial communities exhibit linkage   3  do biotic relationships and linkage vary with slope aspect  Field data were based on eight intensively sampled 400 m 2 sample plots on each of NE  and SW facing aspects of a forested ridge  a total of 16 plots for the study As expected  there were notable differences in both soil characteristics and biotic community composition between aspects  Moisture  organic matter  pH  extractable NO 3     and net nitrification were all significantly higher in NE soils  whereas extractable NH 4 + was significantly higher in SW soils  net N mineralization was virtually identical between aspects  Overall  29 tree and 118 herbaceous species were encountered in the study  with overstory dominated by sugar maple and sweet buckeye on NE slopes and white oak on SW slopes  The herb layer of the NE aspect was predominantly forbs  whereas graminoids dominated SW slopes  Important microbial groups for NE soils were Gram + and Gram    bacteria  SW soils were dominated by fungal groups  Using correlations of ordination axes of each biotic community  linkage was detected between soil microbes and overstory on the NE slope and between soil microbes and herb layer on the SW slope  We suggest that higher net radiation to the SW slope has resulted in more weathered soil conditions  selecting for microbial groups both adapted to  and maintaining  low N availability  with dominance of NO 3   in more mesic NE soils and NH 4 + in more weathered SW soils  Another important difference appears related to contrasts in humus formation  maintained with soil moisture conditions  The higher moisture of NE soils is more conductive to humus formation and the support of different microbial communities than the SW slopes with drier and more exposed mineral soil  These results demonstrate that plants and microbes can form biotic linkages in forest ecosystems which can vary with vegetation strata and slope aspect       
 Pattern of forest overstory retention  broad scale environmental variation and species traits influence spatial patterning of understory vegetation after thinning 	  Responses of understory vegetation to forest canopy gaps may depend on broad scale environmental variation as well as fine scale processes including plant plant interactions  e g   competition  facilitation  and colonization  e g   dispersal  migration   Therefore  spatial patterns may reflect differences among species in growth form and mode of colonization  For example  clonal reproduction in plants represents an adaptation to persist in stressful low resource conditions  reducing the capacity of plants to colonize disturbed areas  In contrast  sexual reproduction requires more resources but results in greater dispersal distances  Additionally  interactions among woody and herbaceous species may vary along gradients in canopy cover  We examined 1  factors affecting the cover of shrubs  forbs  graminoids and ferns in understories at multiple spatial scales  and 2  compared results for species capable of clonal reproduction to results for species that reproduce only by seed  We used an operational scale manipulative thinning experiment replicated seven times in the Coast and Cascade ranges of western Oregon  USA  Three thinning treatments and an untreated control  along with a fine scale spatial network of geo referenced permanent vegetation sampling plots were delineated at each site  This study focuses on the spatial patterning of understory vegetation observed six years following thinning Results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis show that the cover of shrubs and forbs responds similarly to gap creation and reductions in basal area  BA  associated with thinning  and that shrubs reduce the cover of forbs locally  In addition to effects on residual density  thinning treatment affected the cover of some groups suggesting that thinning has other important effects  e g   physical disturbance of the forest floor and vegetation   Differences in effects of potential direct incident solar radiation  BA and treatment  and differences in patterns of residual spatial correlation among clonal and non clonal species may reflect differences in the abilities of these groups to persist in stressful environments and colonize disturbed areas  as well as spatial scale over which unmeasured processes operate  This hierarchy of controls results in spatial patterns in forest understories that can have important consequences for future forest development and the maintenance of biodiversity       
Bringing climate change education into the college classroom and through the internet The National Council for Science and the Environment  NCSE   its Council of Environmental Deans and Directors  CEDD  and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium  AIHEC  have collaborated since 2011 on an NSF funded project to help prepare college and university educators to teach about climate change  The centerpiece is the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation E Learning  CAMEL  web resource at www CAMELclimatechange org   The site allows easy access to more than 1000 peer reviewed  hyper linked encyclopedia style articles  cross published from NCSE  s Encyclopedia of the Earth www eoearth org and more than 500 curricular resources including presentations  images  lab exercises  videos  games  podcasts  and simulations  The curricular resources include learning objectives  assessment tools and teaching notes to facilitate use of the resources by other educators  The CAMEL platform enables expert review and user evaluation of content  and discussion around nearly 300 topics on climate change causes  consequences  solutions  and participation  In addition to providing educational applications of social networking tools  the platform allows educators to create public or password protected websites for use as   virtual classrooms   with customized resources  tests  and additional features  A   live cross publishing   feature enables educators to easily incorporate content about global climate change into their own courses The AIHEC/NCSE/CEDD partnership includes support of teams of faculty at Northern Arizona University  NAU  with Tohono O'odham Community College  TOCC  and at College of the Menominee Nation  CMN  with University of Wisconsin Milwaukee who have developed curricular modules the integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge  TEK  with western science about climate change  Outreach has included a two semester webinar series  targeted webinars for faculty from Tribal Colleges and Universities  TCUs  and workshops at ESA  AIHEC  CEDD and SACNAS meetings  As of February 2013  CAMEL included over 100 articles and nearly 50 teaching resources in its American Indian and Indigenous Peoples collection  These include curricular modules on Climate Change  Water and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the Southwest developed by Octaviana Trujillo of NAU and Teresa Newberry of TOCC  Climate Statistics for Indigenous Students by Lisa Bosman and Bill Van Lopik of CMN and videos such as Where Words Touch The Earth by CMN students  Other resources include Case Studies such as  Alberta  s Oil Sands and the Rights of First Nations Peoples to Environmental Health  Podcasts including TED Talks such as Nalini Nadkarni on Conserving the Canopy and workbooks such as Northwest Tribes  Meeting the Challenge of Climate Change       
 Climate change  water and traditional ecological knowledge in the southwest  Culturally relevant  transciplinary science curriculum  The skills  techniques  and extensive knowledge of the local environment that indigenous communities have accumulated over many generations  often yet unknown to modern science  makes traditional knowledge critical to advancing sustainable environmental practices  not only for those indigenous communities  but for the global community as well  Understanding how to effectively conserve and utilize traditional knowledge is an important part of the mission of Tohono O  odham Community College  a tribal college  and the Applied Indigenous Studies department at Northern Arizona University  NAU   Undergraduate science curriculum designed to be relevant to the culture of Native students is essential for developing the local experts and scientifically literate populace needed to address scientific challenges faced by Native communities  Faculty members Teresa Newberry  TOCC  and Octaviana V  Trujillo  NAU  developed a teaching module on water issues impacted by climate change that incorporates traditional O  odham knowledge of water At Tohono O  odham Community College  TOCC     the science curriculum has been developed under the premise that science is part of the cultural heritage of each student  as every culture has relied upon processes for gathering and making meaning of information about the natural world  Traditional Ecological Knowledge or TEK   A cornerstone of TOCC  s science program is a course on Global Change Biology which bridges Western Science and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the area of climate change  This course incorporates a module which was developed as part of a cross institutional collaboration with Northern Arizona University and the CAMEL Project  Students learn about the traditional and modern uses of water by the Tohono O  odham Nation including Traditional Ecological Knowledge of water  climate and the natural world  They also learn about predicted climate change impacts on water resources of the region and apply that knowledge to identifying potential impacts on water use of the O  odham  Using a model that incorporates elder  water policy  climate change science  students will develop water policy scenarios  adaptation plans and tribal resolutions addressing climate change impacts on the water resources on southwestern tribal lands       
 Climate change  water and traditional ecological knowledge of the Tohono O  odham  A case study  Undergraduate science curriculum designed to be culturally relevant to Native students is essential for developing the local experts and scientifically literate populace needed to address scientific challenges faced by Native communities  At Tohono O  odham Community College  TOCC   a tribal college  the science curriculum has been developed under the premise that science is part of the cultural heritage of each student  as every culture has relied upon processes for gathering and making meaning of information about the natural world  Traditional Ecological Knowledge or TEK   TOCC  s science program includes a Global Change Biology course which incorporates a case study on water and climate change in the Southwest developed for the CAMEL site  In this case study the students learn about the traditional knowledge of water of the Tohono O  odham including traditional perspectives on water and historical adaptations by the O  odham to the arid climate of the region  The students are then introduced to climate change impacts in the Southwest including impacts on water resources of the region  Students then apply and integrate both the traditional ecological knowledge and climate change science into water policy scenarios  adaptation plans and tribal resolutions addressing climate change impacts on the water resources on southwestern tribal lands  This case study can serve as a model for how to effectively incorporate TEK into science curriculum by presenting traditional knowledge alongside scientific knowledge and then giving students the opportunity to apply both knowledge sets in solving current climate change issues  This not only provides students with undergraduate science curriculum that is culturally relevant and validates traditional ecological knowledge but also develops the local experts and scientifically literate populace needed to address scientific challenges faced by Native communities       
The response of one tribal college to the issue of climate change	  Climate change poses unique threats and dangers to the survival of indigenous communities worldwide  even though they contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions  Their traditional livelihoods and sustainable lifestyles are tied directly to the health of the land  This is no more true than the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin which takes its   cultural identity and economic base from the rich forest ecosystem that the tribe has tended to for centuries in northern Wisconsin  The College of Menominee Nation  which was chartered by the Menominee tribe in 1993  has been instrumental in raising the awareness of what climate change means to Indian country  The college has held conferences  community workshops  conducted research  developed curriculum and changed operational protocols in response to this threat  This presentation will focus on some of the specifics of these efforts and provide a best practices example of a holistic response to climate change  The college has adopted a realistic understanding that a balanced response must include both a mitigation and adaptation plan  Native Americans have proved their resiliency to past climatic changes in the Americas and can now offer evidence for future responses       
Boundary spanning collaborations to facilitate community led adaptations for self reliance and sustainability in Alaska Both climate and socioeconomic conditions are changing rapidly in Alaska  Rural Alaskan indigenous communities  which are disconnected from the road system and electricity grid  face the highest cost of fuel and other commercial goods in the U S  but have few jobs and insufficient income to pay these costs  The Alaska Native Science Commission  ANSC   the University of Alaska Fairbanks  UAF  and four Alaskan indigenous communities  Igiugig  Koyukuk  Newtok  and Nikolai  recently initiated a Community Partnership for Self Reliance and Sustainability  The goal of the partnership is to foster inreach from communities to the university to develop collaborations that implement each community  s vision for self reliance and sustainability  During three visits to each community  two ANSC leaders and a UAF graduate student and faculty member  1  listened to sustainability issues identified by tribal leadership and the community as a whole and asked questions to clarify understanding   2  listened to community priorities and offered suggestions of ways that UAF expertise might address some of these  and  3  established collaborative connections between community leaders and appropriate UAF research groups to guide and implement community solutions  The graduate student and tribal liaisons were critical to effective communication and progress at every stage Each of the four communities had at least one critical self reliance issue that differed from issues identified by the other three communities  was critical to community self reliance  and was not addressed by any government program  This included village relocation in Newtok  acceptance of Koyukuk  s strategy of adapting to flooding by protecting infrastructure in place  secure rights to pure water in Igiugig  and rights to fish for salmon in Nikolai  In addition  all communities share common concerns about some issues such as the high cost of energy  Each community found different ways to address this problem  Nikolai installed smart meters that enabled each household to monitor their electricity use to avoid high payments above some threshold  Newtok designed energy efficient housing  Igiugig integrated multiple forms of renewable energy in their energy system  All communities identified and initiated key innovations before the collaboration began  and the partnership served primarily to facilitate further design refinements and implementation and the sharing of innovations among communities  The major product of the partnership has been to build trust and enthusiasm for collaboratively addressing community identified opportunities  The success of individual projects remains to be determined       
Using a paired plot design to differentiate between the belowground causes and consequences of Rhamnus cathartica L  invasions Using the invasive shrub Rhamnus cathartica L   European buckthorn  hereafter buckthorn  as a model species  we developed a repeatable study framework that is capable of determining if the differences observed between soils with and without exotic shrubs pre date invasion  possibly promoting establishment  or are shrub induced  Ninety seven buckthorn invaded plots located throughout Chicago area woodlands that varied in invasion severity were each paired to an adjacent buckthorn free plot  Invasion severity was quantified as an invaded plot  s score along the three major axes of a PCoA ordination constructed from measures of buckthorn basal area  percent cover  height  sapling density  and invasion age  3 62 yr  made at that plot  Soil parameters hypothesized to promote and/or respond to buckthorn invasions  moisture  pH  total carbon  total nitrogen  inorganic nitrogen  calcium  leaf litter mass  earthworm biomass  microbial community structure  and functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling  were measured at each plot  The difference in values for these RVs between each invaded and uninvaded plot of all plot pairs was calculated   Delta RVs   A relationship  linear or non linear  between a  Delta RV  and severity      slope  ne  0  indicates a buckthorn induced change  An intercept  value of  Delta RV where invasion severity = 0  different from zero indicates a pre existing difference Our framework  paired plot design and statistical modeling of  Delta RVs   unlike simply comparing differences between soils with and without exotic shrubs  can detect if these differences pre date invasion or are shrub induced  and unlike short term manipulative experiments  can detect belowground changes that occur slowly over time  We found that buckthorn invaded plots had higher levels of soil moisture  pH  total carbon  total nitrogen  ammonium N  calcium  and Archaeal amo A genes  associated with nitrification   as well as differing fungal communities  than buckthorn free plots prior to invasion  intercepts    0   and that these RVs did not change as invasion severity increased  slopes = 0  as is hypothesized  Buckthorn is therefore more likely to invade where these RVs are elevated  We did  however  find that buckthorn establishes in areas with greater rates of leaf litter decomposition  intercepts  ne  0  and then proceeds to decrease leaf litter mass further  and to alter levels of soil NO 3    N and bacterial community structure  slopes  ne  0   These findings can inform future investigations  For example  knowing that the difference in a particular RV pre dates invasion justifies studying if this RV directly promotes invasion  while knowing that the difference in a particular RV is buckthorn induced justifies studying the longevity and consequences of this change       
Changes in soil nutrients and microbial communities following understory shrub invasion by Berberis thunbergii Berberis thunbergii   or Japanese barberry  is a clonal shrub that has invaded numerous forests in the northeastern United States  Research we carried out over the past decade has shown that B  thunbergii alters soil properties and microbial communities  and that many of these effects persist after B  thunbergii is removed  These studies were performed in the field or greenhouse  and focused on characterizing soil nitrogen availability and mineralization  as well as microbial community structure  through phospholipid fatty acid analysis  and function  through extracellular enzyme activities   Most recently  we have investigated root architecture and functional traits  as well as belowground competitive dynamics in B  thunbergii and other shrub species  Our aim is to synthesize research on B  thunbergii interactions and effects belowground so as to more fully characterize the ecological legacies of its invasion for both microbial and plant communities The most consistent edaphic changes that we have found in association with B  thunbergii colonization are increases in nitrate availability  nitrification rate  and pH  In addition  we have observed shifts in microbial community composition  primarily increases in bacteria fungi  as well as decreases in the activity of several extracellular soil enzymes  Evidence from the field and greenhouse indicate that these changes persist for at least three years  though actual durations are likely much longer  Although several of our studies implicated leaf litter in raising soil nitrogen and initiating microbial community shifts  several lines of indirect evidence suggest that root litter and exudates also contribute to the observed shifts  In one study  we found that B  thunbergii roots have low C N and morphological traits associated with rapid turnover  and in another study we found greater legacy effects in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil  Our research has yielded some insight into the implications of B  thunbergii   s belowground legacies  Potentially as a result of increased nitrate availability  B  thunbergii and competing species both grew more rapidly in greenhouse soils that were previously conditioned by the invader  However  the stand structure and distribution of roots beneath B  thunbergii stands suggest that it can capitalize disproportionately on elevated soil nitrogen  In addition to leaving legacies that persist after plants are removed  B  thunbergii can thereby capitalize on soil feedbacks  ultimately contributing to its ability to form monocultures in forest understories       
How plant soil interactions affect current and future invasions  Field and greenhouse plant soil feedback results for three co occurring southeastern invasive shrubs Approximately one third of forest invaders in the southeastern United States are woody shrub species  Many forests are invaded by multiple woody shrub species and little is known about the interactions of co occurring invasive shrubs  Plant soil feedbacks  PSF  are one mechanism explaining successful invasions  However  we know little about PSFs between co occurring invaders  even though understanding feedbacks might inform us about how co occurring species interact  To study this problem  I used three naturally co occurring invasive woody species Ligustrum sinense   Lonicera maackii   and Rhamnus dauverica to test feedbacks within and among co occurring invaders  Using field and greenhouse experiments I ask   1  What are the feedbacks between three co occurring invasive woody shrubs  and  2  are results from greenhouse and field plant soil feedback studies similar  In the greenhouse  we conditioned uninvaded field soil with one individual of each invasive species and then grew individuals of each species in conditioned soil  sterilized soil  and uninvaded forest soils  In the field  we planted 1 080 seedlings of each invasive shrub underneath the canopies of the three invaders  We analyzed final plant biomass  plant height  and number of leaves  and calculated PSFs among each invader across soil treatments We found evidence of facilitation among invasive species  which may promote further invasion and change abundance of woody invaders  In the greenhouse  we detected no feedbacks for Ligustrum   positive feedbacks for Lonicera in conspecific conditioned soils  and positive feedbacks for Rhamnus in soils conditioned by other invaders  When grown in uninvaded soils  Rhamnus had 50% less aboveground biomass and 35% less belowground biomass than in soils conditioned by Ligustrum   and 42% less aboveground and 12% less belowground biomass than in soils conditioned by Lonicera   In the field  we found that seedling survival in the first 15 weeks varied by species  F=34 45  p  0 001  but not by plot type  F=0 02  p=0 89   Across all plots  Rhamnus survival was 70 3% while Ligustrum and Lonicera survival was 35 8 % and 38 3%  respectively  However  in individual species models  Rhamnus survival in Rhamnus plots was 82%  which was significantly higher than in Lonicera  61%  or Ligustrum  70%  plots  F=3 20  p = 0 05   Survival of Lonicera and Ligustrum did not differ between plots       
Non additive effects of native invasive tree litter mixtures enhance invasive species   impacts on nutrient cycling during the growing season	  Some of the most aggressive invasive plant species are able to promote their success through positive plant soil feedbacks  One way they can do this is by producing high quality  low C N  leaf litter  which can accelerate decomposition and enhance system nutrient availability  However  when leaf litters of differing quality decompose in a common environment  they can exhibit non additive effects  NAE  on decomposition and N loss where the rate of decomposition differs from what would be expected based on each component litter independently  We hypothesized that litter mixtures containing invasive and native tree litter would experience synergistic NAE  To test this  we conducted a litter bag experiment using two species litter mixtures from four invasive tree or shrub species   Acer ginnala   Elaeagnus umbellata  Lonicera maackii  and Morus alba   and four native tree species   Carya glabra  Cercis canadensis  Liriodendron tulipifera  and Quercus palustris   commonly found in Indiana  USA  To examine possible effects of evenness  bags containing mixed species litter were filled at loading ratios of 10  50  or 90 percent invasive species litter  Litter bags were collected after 90 or 365 days  and were measured for mass loss and nitrogen loss  We detected NAE on mass loss in all species pairings  although not at every loading ratio and the presence  sign  and strength of observed NAE varied over time  NAE on N loss were more frequently detected than NAE on mass loss  and were almost always antagonistic after 90 days and synergistic after 365 days of decomposition  The strength and sign of NAE were significantly correlated with relative differences between native and invasive species litter chemistry  where higher quality invasive species litter promoted stronger antagonistic NAE in both mass loss and N loss at 90 days  and stronger synergistic NAE at 365 days  Effects of tissue chemistry were strongest in mixtures containing a majority of invasive species litter after 365 days of decomposition  The NAE on N loss we observed suggest that invasive species frequently stimulated increased N release from mixed litter during the growing season  Invasive plants with relatively nutrient rich litter may therefore facilitate more positive plant soil feedbacks than would be expected by enhancing N release from litter mixtures and promoting temporal synchrony between N availability and demand       
Cross habitat and cross kingdom biodiversity effects  Riparian forest invasion by Lonicera maackii regulates aquatic macroinvertebrate and microbial communities Invasion of headwater stream riparian zones by exotic shrubs is an outstanding model system for understanding cross systems subsides between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems  Lonicera maackii is a highly successful invader of riparian forests along headwater streams in Midwestern North America and we are executing a series of studies to develop a mechanistic framework for understanding the functional connectivity between riparian and aquatic ecosystemsIn a riparian restoration experiment we have found  1  that the overarching canopy caused by L  maackii invasion of riparian zones acts as a   filter   for woody debris and native foliage  reducing the total organic matter input to the stream  In an in stream leaf breakdown experiment  our data indicate that  2  L  maackii has litter that decomposes significantly faster than native species  In fact  we recorded in stream breakdown rates of L  maackii was 4  times  faster than that of native species  The aquatic biota colonizing L  maackii leaf packs was different than native leaf packs in terms of total density  taxonomic composition  and functional feeding group dominance  We also have data that suggest  3  biofilm formation on L  maackii foliage is more rapid  with more structurally complex architecture  and with altered taxonomic composition  Taken together  our data suggest that riparian biodiversity loss and community simplification in headwater stream riparian forests  caused by a terrestrial exotic plant  has cascading effects on aquatic microbial and macroinvertebrate communities  trophic structure and cross system energy/nutrient flow  We are particularly interested in the idea of mirroring biodiversity effects  where the loss of biodiversity in the terrestrial habitat simplifies the aquatic habitat template which results in biodiversity loss in the macroinvertebrate and microbial communities  Ongoing work will pursue these lines of inquiry       
Trophic effects of Rosa multiflora in urban forests The FRAME program  Forest Fragments in Managed Ecosystems  is long term study of forest fragments along a gradient of urbanization  One of the main goals of the FRAME is to explore multitrophic interactions in the novel ecosystems created by nonnative plant invasion  To facilitate this research we established 30 sites and quantified soil macro  and micronutrients  vegetation structure and composition    invertebrate biomass    herptofauna occupancy  and avian density and reproductive success   The most commonly occurring invasive plant in our Mid Atlantic FRAME sites is Rosa multiflora   an Asiatic species once widely planted as a refuge for wildlife  Preliminary data from other sites in DE showed significant differences between Ca rich invertebrates such as snails and isopods  soil pH  and soil Ca Al beneath R  multiflora shrubs and those at locations with native plants or leaf litter  We attempted to verify these results with an expanded study in the FRAME including a number of key species in various trophic strata  The presence of R  multiflora in the 30 Mid Atlantic FRAME sites was positively and significantly correlated with higher levels of soil calcium  greater numbers of catbird   Dumetella carolinensis   territories  and greater numbers of Ca rich prey  Over 40% of catbird nests found in our sites were in R  multiflora  and 46% of catbird nests in rose successfully fledged young  Historical data from one of our sites  from the 1960s  shows that invasion by R  multiflora has occurred over the past 50 years  It also reveals a suggestive change between territories numbers for wood thrush   Hylocichla mustelina     a urban avoider that does not nest in R  multiflora   and catbird territories  Other interactions seen  such as those between leaf litter volume and nonnative plant invasion  beg future research on interactions between nonnative earthworms and invasive plants       
 Effects of winter snowpack  fire and forest structure on invasive plant establishment  In montane forests of western North America  climate and forest management  in particular winter snowpack  fire  and forest harvest practices  strongly interact to influence vegetation structure  At higher elevations in these mountain ranges  where invasive plants are relatively less abundant  changes in these dynamics may interact to provide recruitment opportunities for invasive plants spreading from lower elevations  With the expectation of decreased winter snowpack duration due to climate change  longer growing seasons may promote population growth of invasive plants  Furthermore  with predicted increases in both fire occurrence and fuel reduction treatments via forest thinning  disturbance at higher elevations may also favor plant invasions  We transplanted two invasive shrubs  Scotch broom and Spanish broom  above their invasive range in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada of California  We investigated how fire and forest thinning interact with changes in winter snowpack to affect establishment success of these invasive shrubs  We planted seeds of each species in a nested block design across three forest structures  untreated forest  thinned forest  and clearcuts  and subjected a subset of blocks in thinned forest to prescribed fire  During winter 2012  we either increased or decreased snowpack levels at a subset of plots within each block We documented effects of snowpack level  fire and forest structure on two establishment stages  winter survival of seedlings  and spring germination  Effects varied by species  Scotch broom  the shrub with the higher invasive elevation range  was unaffected by winter snowpack level at either establishment stage  regardless of forest structure or fire  For Spanish broom  however  which has a lower elevation range than Scotch broom  both spring germination and winter survival were higher under the reduced snowpack treatment  Both species had the highest germination rates in fuel treatments  and adding prescribed fire to thinned forest further increased germination rates  However  we document an interaction between fire and snowpack for Spanish broom  such that fire stimulated increased germination only in treatments receiving reduced snowpack  We conclude that  particularly for low elevation invasive plants that may be more vulnerable to extended frost  reductions in snowpack have the potential to facilitate greater establishment success  particularly in forests managed using fuel treatments and active fire  These results suggest that future changes in climate may constrain management options in montane forests where invasive plants are a primary management concern       
Shared strategy or unique niches  Using functional traits of invasive shrubs of Michigan to test competing hypotheses of invasion Invasive species are a substantial threat to native communities  threatening to alter habitat structure  displace native species  and even alter ecosystem function  A number of hypotheses of invasion have been proposed  but substantial work remains to determine their generality and fit to specific systems  Some try to define invasive species by a suite of shared trait  others argue that increased intraspecific variability allows local adaptation  Alternatively  invasive species may displace local species through competition for the same niche space  Within Southeast Michigan  several common shrub species are invasive in the understory of existing forests  Prior work comparing traits of an invasive with those of native species suggested that the study species may be   cheating   on the growth survival tradeoff  allowing it to persist in the understory when its traits suggest it should not  Here  we ask if the suite of invasive shrubs all share these similar traits  and a similar advantage in the understory  or if each species is exploiting a unique pathway into the understory by comparing their traits to each other and those of the native community  We utilize a standard suite of plant functional traits to address this question In the forest understory of our research site in Lenawee County  Michigan  we found substantial populations of Elaeagnus umbellata   Rosa multiflora  and Lonicera maackii   along with more scattered individuals of Berberis thunbergii and Euonymos alatus   For specific leaf area  three invasive species showed the highest SLA  while the other two placed in the bottom 7 among all species  Similar results were found for leaf dry matter content  at the low end of the spectrum  and leaf nitrogen content  high content in the invasives   but not for leaf laminar area  For the first three traits  the five invasive species were statistically indistinguishable from one another  leading us to conclude that invasive shrubs in this Michigan forest share similar ecological strategies for invasion  Their position at the extreme  light demanding  end of trait values suggests these species are living outside of the expected habitat for their traits  Finally  trait variation  as measured by standard deviation  does not differ among the invasive species or between invasive and native species       
Synergy among introduced plants and earthworms in woodlands of the upper Midwest The introduced plant species Rhamnus cathartica  European or common buckthorn  and various species of non native earthworms are associated with pronounced changes in plant communities of savannas and woodlands in the upper Midwest  as well as alteration of nutrient cycling in the same areas  R  cathartica and earthworms each have their own particular effects  but they also seem to positively affect each other  s success expanding their ranges and establishing populations  Earthworms  either cultured Eisenia fetida or wild caught Lumbricus terrestris   were presented with leaf litter from R  cathartica   Acer saccharum  sugar maple   or Quercus macrocarpus  burr oak   the native dominants of regional woodlands and savannas  in combination or singly in mesocosm experiments  Amounts of litter consumed and changes in population number and size distribution were recorded E  fetida  redworms  choose leaf litter from R  cathartica over leaf litter from Q  macrocarpus and A  saccharum   When presented with only one species of leaf litter  E  fetida consumed much more of R  cathartica than either of the natives  E  fetida   s population growth rates were considerably higher on a diet of leaf litter from R  cathartica than when fed leaf litter from either of the native species  Wild caught Lumbricus terrestris display the same feeding preferences in parallel mesocosm experiments  even though the animals had no prior experience with R  cathartica because they were collected from stands of A  saccharum that completely lack R  cathartica   Additional experiments are underway to measure the effect of R  cathartica on L  terrestris   population dynamics  These results suggest that earthworm populations may have different population dynamics and growth rates when R  cathartica is present than other wise  which could increase their potential effect on nutrient dynamics within such sites       
 Marcell Experimental Forest  USDA Forest Service peatland research past and present 	  The Marcell Experimental Forest  MEF  is an 1141 ha tract of land located in northern Minnesota  The MEF contains 6 experimental watersheds  each consisting of an upland portion and a peatland that is the source of a stream leaving the watershed  Climatic and hydrologic data have been collected continuously since 1960  Studies in the 1960s were instrumental in bolstering our understanding of the physical and hydrological properties of peat  Subsequent studies beginning in the late 1960  s focused on the effect of forest management  e g  peatland and upland harvesting  on hydrologic responses and element transport  Studies beginning in the 1970s delved deeper into processes related to element cycling across a range of hydrologic conditions  Carbon related studies began in earnest in the 1980s as the first peatland eddy covariance measurements were at MEF  In the 1990s a series of studies began to assess the influence of peatlands on watershed cycling of mercury  More recent studies are measuring mercury cycles across a range of peatland and upland systems including the effects of elevated sulfate deposition and upland harvesting  Our long history of peatland research led MEF to being selected as the site for the next ecosystem scale manipulation sponsored by the Department of Energy  The Spruce and Peatlands Under Climatic and Environmental Change  SPRUCE  experiment aims to identify the critical response functions for organisms  communities  and ecosystems to rapidly changing climate conditions  We are constructing an experimental platform to address climate change responses in a bog ecosystem at MEF  This ecosystem is located at the southern extent of the boreal peatland forests and is hypothesized to be especially vulnerable to climate change and to have important feedbacks to the atmosphere  The experiment will allow us to test mechanisms ecosystem processes for multiple levels of warming  up to +9 deg C  combined with elevated CO 2 exposures  900 ppm   New methods for whole ecosystem warming at plot scales of 12 m diameter have been developed  We plan to quantify thresholds for organism decline or mortality  limitations to regeneration  biogeochemical limitations to productivity  and changing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere  SPRUCE will allow for the evaluation of responses across multiple scales including microbial communities  bryophyte populations  various higher plant types  and some faunal groups  Direct and indirect effects of these experimental perturbations will be tracked over a decade for the development and refinement of models needed for full Earth system analyses  Review      
Assessing the quality and the decomposition status of solid phase peat and its porewater dissolved organic matter  DOM  using complementary analytical techniques	  Peatlands sequester one third of all soil carbon and currently act as major sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide  The ability to predict or simulate the fate of stored carbon in response to climatic disruption remains hampered by our limited understanding of the controls of carbon turnover in peatlands  Little is known about the chemical processes and decomposition pathways that link solid phase peat and dissolved organic matter  DOM  within its porewaters  In this work we have applied Fourier transform Infra red  FT IR  and 13 C NMR spectroscopy to characterize the solid phase peat at varying depths from different sites at the Marcell Experimental Forest  MEF  where the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  ORNL  has begun the Spruce and Peatland Response Under Climatic and Environmental Change  SPRUCE  project  Parallel Factor analyzed Excitation/Emission Matrix fluorescence spectroscopy  PARAFAC EEMS  and ultrahigh resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry  FT ICR MS  were used to characterize the molecular composition of peat porewaters  Analyses of the solid phase and the porewater suggested the presence of three different zones of varying degrees of humification in the peat core with maximum decomposition occurring between 30 and 50 cm  Above 30 cm and below 50 cm  the peat is less well decomposed compared to the samples from 30 to 50 cm  FT IR and NMR spectra showed variations of molecular composition and chemical structures throughout the three different zones  A general increase in the humification index  defined as the ratio of FT IR absorbances at 2920  2850  1630  and 1515 cm  minus 1 with respect to polysaccharides  1030 cm  minus 1   was observed in the region between 30 and 50 cm  C/N ratios were inversely related to humification     lower C/N occurred with higher humification index  Analyses of the pore waters were in agreement with the analysis of solid phase peat  FT ICR MS and PARAFAC EEMS revealed the presence three different zones  where  where intense and continuous transformation processes took place in the transition zone  30 50cm        
Tropical Peatlands in the Amazon basin  An underestimated CH 4 emission source and their unexplored microbial structure Peatlands are a type of wetlands acting as important net CO 2  fixing  primary productivity  and CH 4  producing  decomposition  ecosystems  Tropical peatlands were thought as mainly important in South Asia  s humid forest and rarely considered in the Amazon basin  Recent expeditions to the Pastaza  Mara  ntilde  on basin in the western Amazon of Peru  reported over 295 peatlands  The newly found volumes  3 6 Gt of organic C  and rates  up to 195 g C m  2   of C accumulation over a large area  21 929 Km 2    have lay to rest the idea that prevailing conditions in the Amazon are unfavorable for peat formation  This raises questions about the significance of these environments for CH 4 formation and release from the Amazon basin  Satellite measurements suggest the tropics  especially the western Amazon basin  are a major source for CH 4 emission  In this study we address  a  whether Amazon peatlands have significant levels of greenhouse gases emissions  particularly CH 4     b  whether ecological gradients have an influence in their rates and  c  also in the make up of microbial communities including methanogens  We evaluated six peatlands and one forest site in the Western Amazon of Peru  Gas fluxes  soil geochemistry  and microbial communities were measured with standard methods All peatlands emitted CH 4   N 2 O and CO 2 and forest was a CH 4  consumer  CH 4 fluxes were variable within sites but in average ranged from 6 15 mg C m  2 day  1   These rates are comparable to those in peatlands from Indonesia or interfluvial wetlands in the central Amazon basin  Also  all sites produced significant levels of N 2 O and CO 2 gases with averages of 0 2 1 2 and 0 5 2 mg N 2 O and g CO 2 m  2 day  1   respectively  pH was variable among sites ranging from 2 5 to 6  and a relationship of acidic pH/oligotrohic versus near neutral pH/minerotrophic was observed from sites   geochemistry  The richness and community distribution of Bacteria and Archaea was catalog with ~580 000 16S rRNA gene reads  Bacteria in Amazon peatlands are highly diverse with over 40 phyla  but dominated by Proteobacteria   Acidobacteria   Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi  Archaea were made up by a diverse community dominated by putative H 2  utilizing methanogens with most sequences represent uncultured novel methanogens  The overall microbial community clustered in groups related to ecosystem type  forest vs peatland  and pH  acidic to near neutral   Amazon peatlands are sources of CH 4 emissions likely influenced by site gradients shaping the composition  and possible activity  of Bacteria and CH 4  producing Archaea       
Soil microbial community determines vulnerability of soil carbon exposed to warming in northern permafrost The plant carbon  C  has been accumulated in permafrost over hundreds to thousands of years because the low temperature and saturated soil condition protect organic C from microbial decomposition  As a result  enormous soil organic carbon is stored in permafrost  and likely more labile and thus vulnerable to climate change compared to the organic C stored in other ecosystems  The recent warming over the past decades has been documented in the northern high latitude region and is likely to continue during the 21 st century  Through microbial decomposition  the release of previously frozen soil C in permafrost to the atmosphere under warming scenarios is one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to climate change  However  little is known about responses of soil microbial community to warming in permafrost  Here  we utilized microarray based GeoChip and other metagenomic techniques to investigate the early phase response of soil microbial community one year after the establishment of winter warming treatment at the experiment site in Interior Alaska  compared with the microbial responses after one year continuous experimental warming in Central Oklahoma Though warming increased soil temperature and substrates at both sites  the soil microbial community compositions were only altered at the AK site  More genes involved in C and N cycles were stimulated by warming at the AK site with greater magnitudes compare to limited warming effects observed at the OK site  These warming induced changes at the AK site caused substantial alterations in ecosystem functions  e g  higher degree of decomposition indicated by increased soil 13 C content and enhanced plant N update as indicated by higher foliar and litter N mass  and eventually affect the ecosystem net C exchange  The quick early phase responses of soil microbial community observed at the AK site indicates a rapid atmosphere CO 2 accumulation after plant growth cannot completely offset the C release from increased microbial decomposition under warming  This study demonstrates the importance of integrating soil microbes into models to project future scenarios of climate changes in different ecosystems as soil microbial community may not necessarily react to substrate increase and violate most modeling assumptions  as shown at the OK site       
Methane flux from peatland ecosystems in response to environmental change  Insights from the past and opportunities for the future	  In addition to acting as a globally significant store of carbon  peatlands are also an important natural source of methane  CH 4   to the atmosphere  Given the high global warming potential of CH 4   understanding the response of peatland CH 4 flux to environmental change   including temperature  water table level  and elevated atmospheric CO 2   is crucial for understanding the future role of peatlands in the global climate  CH 4 flux is the result of CH 4 production  consumption and transport and is regulated by both plant and microbial activities  Unraveling the mechanistic controls of these activities remains a challenge for both understanding and modeling the response of peatland CH 4 flux to environmental change  Synthesis of past research exploring the response of peatland CH 4 flux to environmental change reveals a number of consistent patterns  most notably   1  warmer temperatures increases CH 4 flux   2  wetter conditions increase CH 4 flux  and  3  elevated CO 2 increases CH 4 flux  Projects exploring the interactive effects of these environmental changes are limited  but suggest that interactions are important  Increasingly  there is a growing body of work demonstrating that the mechanistic controls of these responses are complex and involve links between plant  microbe and soil dynamics  For example  increased CH 4 production in response to temperature is linked to a number of non methanogenic microbial activities  including  fermentation  acetate production  and the competitive reduction of inorganic and organic terminal electron acceptors  The response of CH 4 flux to water table level may be related not only to oxygen sensitivity of CH 4 production and consumption  but also to longer term shifts in plant community structure  Elevated CO 2 impacts are frequently linked to the increase in organic carbon substrates associated with increased plant productivity  Comparative studies in different peatland types  e g   bogs and fens  suggest that the controls of CH 4 dynamics likely differ between different peatlands for reasons which are not well understood  Taken together  past research highlights the importance of developing stronger mechanistic models of production  consumption  transport  and ultimately flux of CH 4 from peatlands for exploring links between peatlands and environmental change       
Biogeochemical and vegetation controls on carbon storage and GHG losses in southeastern pocosin peatlands  Do drought and drainage really matter 	  Natural peatlands are threatened by projected increases in prolonged droughts and increased temperatures according to recent IPCC models  Millions of hectares of former peatlands have also been drained and converted to agriculture and forestry in the U S  However  while drought and drainage promotes the decomposition of organic matter in soil  leading to accelerated soil subsidence  and severe carbon losses in northern sphagnum peatlands  shrub dominated SE peatlands seemingly defy accelerated loss of carbon  We postulate that some different controlling factors or substrates  directly from drought or indirectly from drought induced species changes  rather than anoxia alone must exist in the seasonally unsaturated SE peatlands and activate during drought  allowing these peat soils to resist further peat decomposition and CO 2 emission  To test this hypothesis we did comparative field studies of GHG fluxes and C storage in 2010 2011 in replicated drained  restored and reference pocosin peatlands  These pocosins  shrub bogs  are characterized by a very dense growth of mostly broadleaf evergreen shrubs with scattered Pinus serotina   The typically thick layer of peat soils 1 3 m  Histosols  underlying pocosins store nearly 300 Mt of carbon in NC alone  a potential major source of atmospheric carbon input if fully decomposed   Comparative field studies of GHG fluxes in replicated drained  restored and reference sites indicate that losses were greatest for CO 2   and lowest for N 2 O and CH 4   Comparison of treatments found more CO 2 release under dryer soils but only immediately after drainage  further suggesting that climate induced drought or drainage does not results in continued massive losses of CO 2  Importantly  regression analysis showed that polyphenol was the main factor inhibiting CO 2 emission  Pocosin peats were found to contain substantial amounts of polyphenol  derived from high phenolics in leaves and high lignin in pocosin shrub leaves and stems  Seasonal drought enhanced the release of polyphenol in soil with reduced phenol oxidase activity  However  most studies in saturated boreal peatlands show that a drop in water level introduced more oxygen and accelerated phenol oxidase activity  decomposing more polyphenol  The differing results between our seasonally unsaturated and saturated northern peatlands suggest that phenol oxidase activity may have a peak optimal moisture level threshold  Above this threshold  anoxia is the key factor inhibiting phenol oxidase activity in waterlogged peat soil  Below it  reduced soil moisture limits enzyme activity  Consequently  more polyphenol will exist under climate induced moderate drought helping shrub formed peat to resist decomposition       
Spatial and temporal variation in peat pore water chemistry of a northern peatland  Reference conditions of a large scale climate change experiment  SPRUCE  Climate change will disproportionally affect higher latitude ecosystems  and northern peatlands will be particularly susceptible  Decomposition in these high carbon ecosystems is expected to increase in a warmer  carbon dioxide enriched future  Quantifying the dynamics of carbon and associated biogeochemical cycles under current and future climate scenarios is necessary to understand how climate change may alter these important ecosystem processes  During a large scale ecosystem experiment in an 8 1 ha black spruce  Sphagnum bog at the Marcell Experimental Forest  Marcell  MN   temperature  ambient to +9  deg C  and CO 2 concentrations  ambient  +900 ppm  will be increased inside replicated  12 m diameter  open topped chambers  Prior to the onset of this experiment  we measured the spatial and temporal variation in peat pore water chemistry to develop a baseline for the design of the experiment and to better understand biogeochemical cycling under ambient conditions We found the largest differences in chemistry by depth  0 to 3 m deep   and little variation in near surface pore waters from bog  lagg  transitional zone between uplands and the bog   and outlet stream  Ammonium was low at the surface  0 1 mg/L  likely due to plant uptake  but was highest at depth  3 8 mg/L   potentially due to remineralization in the absence of nitrification  Nitrate was almost always undetectable  except in near surface layers during snowmelt when the water table is high and nitrate bypasses plant and microbial uptake before being exported  Total organic carbon decreased from surface  60 mg/L  to deep  20 mg/L  peats  yet concentrations were at least an order of magnitude higher than in most well studied upland ecosystems  Phosphorus in deeper peats was also high  but there was significant variation in space and time  Overall  there are two different pools of water within the peat  shallower waters originating from precipitation  and deeper waters originating from long residence times in the peat and exchange with the regional groundwater aquifer  If increased temperature results in greater evapotranspiration and drier conditions  these previously isolated deep ammonium and phosphorus pools may become available  with cascading effects to plant and microbial communities       
Nitrogen deposition leads to a weaker carbon sink in a nutrient limited bog Atmospheric nitrogen  N  deposition is increasing owing to fossil fuel burning and agriculture  In nutrient limited peatland ecosystems  the excess of reactive N has been found to increase vascular plant growth  but decrease Sphagnum growth  Higher vascular plant abundance and higher nutrient content alter decomposability of plant litter  These changes are likely to affect net imbalance of production and decomposition and thus carbon  C  accumulation in peatlands  which store about a third of global soil C  We studied whether the vegetation feedbacks of N deposition lead to stronger or weaker C sink in a nutrient limited bog  We investigated vegetation and ecosystem CO 2 exchange at Mer Bleue Bog  Canada that has been fertilized with NO 3 and NH 4  2 8 times ambient annual wet deposition  with or without phosphorus  P  and potassium  K  for 7 12 years  Gross photosynthesis  ecosystem respiration and net CO 2 exchange were measured weekly during May September 2011 using chambers  To isolate microbial respiration  a substrate induced respiration technique was used to determine whether fertilization increased the basal rate of microbial respiration in peat or changed the functional ability of the microbial community  To examine vegetation changes with increasing N influx  vegetation structure in 2011 was compared with that in 2001 2009 The highest nutrient additions were associated with 40% less net CO 2 uptake than in the control  The two sets of treatments revealed contrasting patterns  in the NPK additions  a diminished C sink potential was due to a 20 30% increase in the ecosystem respiration  while gross photosynthesis rates did not change as increased vascular plant biomass compensated for the loss of Sphagnum mosses  In the highest N only addition  the gross photosynthesis was reduced  but ecosystem respiration was unaltered  Substrate induced microbial respiration was significantly higher in all levels of NPK additions compared to control  A weaker C sink potential could be explained by changes in nutrient availability  higher woody foliar ratio  moss loss  and enhanced decomposition  Stronger responses to NPK fertilization than to N only fertilization for both shrub biomass production and decomposition suggest that the plant and microbial communities of this bog ecosystem are N P/K co limited rather than N limited  likely due to prolonged elevated atmospheric N deposition in the region  The two mechanisms enhancing N induced C sink in forests  increased formation of woody biomass and accumulation of surface litter  seem to reduce C storage capacity in bogs owing to the loss of main peat forming mosses       
Implications of climate disturbance interactions for northern peatland carbon cycling Pristine peatlands have a number of stabilizing mechanisms that increase their resilience to stress and disturbance  However  recent research has highlighted the potential for several regime shifts in northern peatlands associated with interactions between climate and disturbances  Here  I will highlight research from regional gradient  ecosystem manipulation  and chronosequence  space for time substitution  studies that focus on the role of climate mediated disturbance  drought  wildfire  permafrost thaw  on peatland vegetation  carbon cycling  and energy balance Thawing permafrost in peat plateaus leads to a state change with the creation of collapse scar bogs or fens  causing large changes in surface characteristics      vegetation  water table position  that have implications for slow processes such as turnover of old carbon stored in the historic permafrost pool  As permafrost continues to thaw at a landscape scale  increasing influxes of heat from groundwater can serve as a positive feedback to thaw  Experimental drainage of a forested peatland resulted in increased carbon pools associated with woody biomass and surface soils  but also increased combustion rates and ecosystem carbon losses during a naturally occuring fire event  Together  long term drainage and severe burning of a forested fen altered the trajectory of post fire vegetation succession typical of more pristine sites  and likely will lead to the future conversion of these sites from fen to forest domains  An understanding of the role of multiple or severe disturbances in affecting peatlands remains limited  yet is essential for predicting the fate of high latitude carbon stocks       
Whole ecosystem warming and CO 2 manipulation to assess ombrotrophic bog responses to hypothetical future environments The Spruce Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change  SPRUCE  experiment is an in situ warming by CO 2 manipulation of a characteristic high carbon ecosystem  It is being conducted to identify critical environmental response functions for terrestrial organisms  communities  and ecosystems to rapidly changing climate conditions  Such research has   real world   relevance when conclusions are drawn from controlled manipulations operating in natural field settings  The experimental platform is being constructed to address climate change response mechanisms in a Picea / Larix / Sphagnum ombrotrophic bog ecosystem located in northern Minnesota  The target ecosystem located at the southern extent of the spatially expansive boreal peatland forests is hypothesized to be especially vulnerable to climate change and to have important feedbacks on atmospheric greenhouse gas levels  New methods for warming at plot scales  12  m diameter  have been developed for this study  We combine aboveground enclosure walls having an internally recirculating warm air envelope with soil deep heating to simulate a range of future warming treatments of as much as +9  deg C  Warming treatments will be repeated at both ambient and elevated CO 2 atmospheres  +900 ppm  to allow the evaluation of key interactions between vegetation response to elevated temperatures and direct effects of CO 2   Direct and indirect effects of these experimental perturbations will be tracked and analyzed over a decade for the development and refinement of models needed for full Earth system analyses  A priori simulations of the effects of warming and elevated CO 2 suggest variable response for the primary producers in this ecosystem  trees and shrubs vs  Sphagnum moss   a strong interaction with nutrient cycling driven by warming induced decomposition of stored elements  esp  N   and a substantial increase in the release of greenhouse gases  CO 2 and CH 4   attenuated to some degree by photosynthetic enhancements of trees and shrubs driven by elevated CO 2 atmospheres  The ambient bog site is undergoing secondary succession from a stand removal clear cut in 1974  and is currently estimated to be transitioning from post harvest carbon losses to annual carbon gains as the tree species become re established  Through the execution of this experiment we will quantify thresholds for organism decline or mortality  limitations to regeneration  biogeochemical limitations to productivity  and changing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere  The experiment will allow for the evaluation of responses across multiple spatial scales including  microbial communities  bryophyte populations  various higher plant types  and some faunal groups       
A framework for climate smart conservation and forest management Land managers face the immense challenge of integrating the uncertainties of a changing climate into decisions that often span large spatial and temporal scales  The challenge of integration is actually twofold  first  sorting through a tremendous amount of research publication to find information that is credible  relevant  and understandable  second  finding realistic ways to consider and apply this information within existing decision making processes  management practices  and operational constraints  To address these challenges  the Forest Service joined with partners to launch a pilot project in 2009 called the Climate Change Response Framework  www forestadaptation org   The Framework was designed to create and gather credible scientific information relevant to forest management and climate  foster close collaboration between scientists and managers  build useful tools that support diverse management goals  and finally seek to deliver products of these efforts in a timely and useful manner  In building a comprehensive program that supports original science  synthesis and assessment  education  planning  and implementation  the goal was not to guide specific actions  but to instead foster climate informed    climate smart    decisions in meeting a wide variety of management objectives  Meeting the needs of numerous land management organizations through an   all lands   approach required that the Framework be flexible enough to be applied at multiple spatial and temporal scales and adapt to diverse management goals  From the original pilot in northern Wisconsin  the Framework is now being actively pursued in nine states in areas covering nearly 135 million acres in the Northwoods  MN  MI  WI   Central Hardwoods  MO  IL  IN   and Central Appalachians  OH  WV  MD   A pilot forest ecosystem vulnerability assessment and forest adaptation resources book for northern Wisconsin have been published  Lessons learned from those efforts are being applied to five new vulnerability assessments and an expansion of the forest adaptation resources  There are currently over 50 non profit  private  county  state  tribal  and federal organizations partnering in the ecoregional Framework projects  Several land management organizations are pursuing climate adaptation planning and implementation as demonstration projects  Cross ownership dialogue about these adaptation demonstrations enhances learning and helps identify landscape level opportunities and constraints  Climate challenges can most effectively be addressed by a community  and the Framework has successfully built a large scale ecoregional network with widely diverse expertise  perspectives  and resources       
Using a species distribution model and traits to assess tree species vulnerability and adaptability under climate change in the U S  Northwoods and Central Hardwoods	  The climate is changing  Tree species at any given location are currently under risk of their habitat changing  increasing  decreasing or staying the same   The degree of change depends on their location relative to their overall range  their particular ecological traits  and the severity of the changing conditions  We attempt to assess species vulnerability  and their capacity to adapt to a changing climate  in two regions of the eastern U S   the Northwoods of Minnesota  Wisconsin  and Michigan  and the Central Hardwoods of Missouri  Illinois  and Indiana  To do so  we use a series of modeling schemes using species distribution models  called DISTRIB  and life history traits  called Modification Factors  or ModFacs   This approach provides clear inference to potential vulnerabilities of the extant tree species composition    The results provide a comprehensive assessment of an assessment area  by presenting location specific considerations of potential climate change impacts  and making these data readily useable for deliberation of management actions  Specifically  they include a series of tables and maps describing suitable habitat for years ending 1990  2040  2070  and 2100 for 70 80 species in each of the six states representing the Northwoods and Central Hardwoods  For example  northern Wisconsin had eight major species which were modeled to have large decreases in habitat by 2100  including sugar maple  quaking aspen  balsam fir  and paper birch   along with 18 species which showed large increases in habitat  including boxelder  bur oak  white oak  and black oak   Farther south in southern Indiana  the large decreasers included eight species such as sugar maple  American beech  black cherry and white ash  while the ten increaser species included southern red oak  blackjack oak  loblolly pine  and shortleaf pine  Each species was also scored for adaptability to cope with increasing climate related disturbances  based on a literature review of nine biological characteristics and 12 disturbance capacities  these   ModFacs   allowed for more reality in interpretation of the species distribution model outputs and allowed better assessment of likely outcomes via the species   inherent adaptive capacity to change       
Coupling LINKAGES and LANDIS Pro to predict future tree species distributions in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian regions Land managers and planners may want to consider potential change in tree distributions in response climate change when managing forests  We investigated changes in the distribution of 20 tree species under alternative climate and land management scenarios in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian Regions of the Eastern United States  We linked downscaled climate data with coupled ecosystem and landscape forest simulation models to project landscapes forward in time  We used the LINKAGES II model to predict establishment of trees based on climate  e g  daily precipitation  temperature  solar radiation   site characteristics  e g  landform  soils  and tree attributes  and incorporated these into the LANDIS model  We used LANDIS to simulate species birth  growth  death  regeneration  mortality  dispersal  disturbances  and management at 10 year time steps and 90m resolution  We addressed model uncertainty by bracketing simulation scenarios at the high and low end of climate change predictions by considering current climate and the PCM B1  GFDL A1fi  and CGCM3 T47  A2 IPCC climate and emission scenarios  All the climate models considered predicted warming temperatures compared to current climate but there were substantial differences in the amount and timing of precipitation  Differences among climate models and from current climate were reflected in predicted changes in the distribution and abundance of trees  In general  Southern species such as shortleaf and loblolly pine were predicted to increase under the three climate models and northern species such as sugar maple were predicted to decrease compared to current climate  Comparison among LINKAGES and LANDIS output demonstrated that while regeneration probabilities might decrease substantially for some species they can persist in the landscape for a long time because trees are long lived  but management and disturbance can hasten species turnover  Our results can help guide forest management decisions to address how well adapted future forests are to future climate       
A multi landscape comparison of potential climate futures in Minnesota and Michigan	  The forests of the Great Lake states are unique ecosystems along the temperate   boreal forest transition zone  Within the northern Midwest  the Boreal Hardwood Transition ecological region covers almost 55 million acres  The current disturbance regime is largely driven by harvesting  The arrowhead region of northeastern Minnesota and the northern lower peninsula of Michigan provide two examples of northern Great Lake forested landscapes that represent a range of unique forest types and conditions  Over the next century  the pace of climate change is projected to exceed the rate of natural adaptation or adaptation via traditional forest management  This lag may result in tree species extirpation  loss of forest structure  productivity  species diversity  and a decline of ecosystem resilience  Our objectives were to assess the resilience of forests in the northern Great Lakes region to climate change and considering current forest management practices  Specifically  we addressed how climate change will affect northern forests in northeastern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan  how the response of the two systems differ  and why  We used a forest landscape simulation model  LANDIS II  that integrates succession  disturbance  and climate change  We simulated two climate emissions scenarios over 150 years  Our simulations indicate substantial  although different  responses across the two landscapes  Landscape simulations resulted in an initial increased total above ground biomass in both Minnesota and Michigan under all climate scenarios  The capacity for increased growth is likely due to the history of intense timber harvesting throughout the Great Lakes region over the last century  Future forest growth includes landscape scale recovery and an overall increase in biomass for all climate scenarios  After 30 years however  the A1FI climate scenario resulted in a departure from the B1 and current climate scenarios within both landscapes  The northeastern Minnesota biomass under the A1FI climate responded after 100 years with a substantial increase in biomass  In contrast  the northern lower Michigan biomass under the A1FI climate resulted in a continual decline throughout the simulation  Likewise  the B1 climate scenario in Michigan resulted in a plateau and slight decline in biomass after 100 years compared to Minnesota where the B1 climate scenario continued to produce biomass that exceeded the current climate scenario at the end of the simulation  There was also large variation among species and forest types       
A broad scale and high resolution spatial simulation of forest composition and biomass changes under climate change  Northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan Forests in the northern Great Lakes region have been experiencing the effects of a warming climate and will be further affected by the continuous warming  and likely wetter  climate  The collective effects of changing climate are complex due to strong interactions with forest growth and succession  increasing timber harvesting  and frequent natural disturbance  We present the first regional  spatial simulations of the Northern Lake States forests incorporating high resolution  250 m  spatial dynamics  We conducted simulations with LANDIS II under two General Circulation Models for climate change  PCM  GFDL  and two different carbon emission scenarios  B1  A1fi   incorporating wind disturbance  forest management  and mitigation alternatives to evaluate those complex interactions on forest composition and biomass over the next 150 years  Our study area includes northern Wisconsin and western portion of Upper Peninsula of Michigan  an area of 8 2 million ha including the Chequamegon Nicolet and Ottawa National Forests and other diverse ownership  We considered the influences of different management due to land ownership  national  state and county forests  private corporate and private industrial forests  on rates of timber harvesting  Downscaled climate data were used to reflect sub regional spatial variations of changing climate  We included wind disturbance within the simulations  Our general results suggest that five northern tree species   Abies balsamea   Betula papyrifera   Picea glauca   Pinus banksiana   P  resinosa   decrease their biomass over time  with strong interaction among diverse ecoregions and climate changes  Acer saccharum will continue to increase its abundance  A broad re invasion of previously available habitat for Tsuga canadensis  is possible under climate change scenarios   Regionally  we found a net positive change trend in aboveground live biomass in comparison to the current biomass throughout simulation scenarios of B1 and A1fi with wind disturbance and without harvesting  indicating that succession remains the dominant driver rather than natural disturbance  However  timber harvesting at current rates lowers aboveground forest biomass compared to the control over time and changes in aboveground biomass over time were non linear across a range of ecoregions and forest types  Harvesting by climate change interactions show strong interactions with regional biomass and tree species decline  and slower invasion of new species  Our study demonstrates the importance of spatially interactive processes in affecting the forest biomass and suggests that active mitigation strategies to maximum carbon sequestration via increasing harvesting rotation period and tree planting practices may have positive effects on aboveground biomass and carbon storage in the region       
 Forest productivity under projected changes in climate and CO 2 in northern Minnesota  Wisconsin  and Michigan using PnET CN  While large changes in atmospheric CO 2   temperature and precipitation are predicted by 2100  the long term consequences for carbon cycling in forests are poorly understood  We used the PnET CN ecosystem model to evaluate the effects of changing climate and atmospheric CO 2 on productivity in forests of the North American Great Lakes region at 1 km spatial resolution  We examined two statistically downscaled and contrasting climate projections  PCM B1 and GFDL A1FI  with the latter predicting more warming and reduced precipitation  to represent a range in potential future climate  Each climate projection was simulated under two CO 2 scenarios  constant and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration  to separate the effects of rising CO 2 from warming and precipitation changes Increased productivity under future climate projections and higher CO 2 was largely driven by CO 2 fertilization effects on reduced stomatal conductance and water stress  Consequently  all results that follow were predicted under rising CO 2 levels  Predicted increases in regional average productivity ranged from 67% under the PCM B1 projection  warmer and wetter  to 142% under the GFDL A1FI projection  hotter and drier   Ecosystem responses varied geographically with the largest increases in productivity in northeastern Minnesota  northern Wisconsin  and upper Michigan  Ecosystem responses also varied by forest type  with deciduous forest types  aspen birch  maple beech birch  elm ash cottonwood  oak hickory  showing the largest increases in productivity  followed by pine  and spruce fir forests  The relative importance of edaphic and climatic spatial drivers of productivity varied over time  suggesting that productivity in Great Lakes forests may switch from being temperature to water limited by the end of the century  This work identifies a potential range of forest ecosystem responses to climate change in the Great Lakes region while highlighting geographical differences in these responses that are useful for natural resource planning and management       
An approach to assessing vulnerability of forest communities to climate change using impact models and expert elicitation Climate change has the potential to alter forest composition and productivity through direct changes in temperature and precipitation and through the effects of physical and biological disturbance  Scientists and land managers use vulnerability assessments to determine which forest species and communities may be at risk under projected climate  To date  forest vulnerability assessments have tended to focus on coastal  alpine  or far northern regions with an emphasis on species over habitats or ecosystems  Vulnerability assessments have also generally relied on either quantitative modeling or a ranking approach based on qualitative information  As part of a broader effort to develop management responses to climate change in the Central Hardwoods  Northwoods  and Central Appalachians regions  we developed a method for assessing forest vulnerability that combines multiple quantitative models and expert elicitation from scientists and land managers  A range of potential futures was assessed using statistically downscaled results from combinations of two emissions scenarios and two global climate models  which were used to forecast regionally specific climate trends and to set boundary conditions for three forest impact models  In each region  a panel of local experts in forest ecology and management examined the range of possible futures to determine potential vulnerability of forest community types to climate change  Uncertainty around each vulnerability determination was assessed using a confidence rating based on the amount of evidence and agreement among evidence We developed vulnerability ratings for 6 12 forest community types in each of the Central Hardwoods  Northwoods  and Central Appalachians regions  Which community types were most vulnerable to climate change varied by region  For example  mesic hardwood forests were considered to have high vulnerability in the Central Hardwoods region  but moderate vulnerability in the Northwoods  Floodplain forests  by contrast  were considered to have relatively high vulnerability in the Central Hardwoods region  and lower vulnerability in the Northwoods  These contrasting vulnerabilities were due to regional differences in how climate change may affect system drivers  stressors  and dominant species and the capacity of a forest community to adapt to climate change  Results from these assessments are currently being used to develop climate change adaptation actions in each region  In addition  the assessment methodology can be used in different regions or for finer scale vulnerability determinations of forest communities       
Incorporating climate change vulnerability into forest adaptation  Case studies from real world adaptation projects	  Although efforts to enhance climate change adaptation are developing rapidly  the implementation of adaptation actions often lags behind and leaves many decision makers wondering what adaptation will look like in practical terms  Real world demonstrations of adaptation are essential for expanding interest in climate change adaptation to a larger audience of natural resource management professionals  Through the Climate Change Response Framework  we have developed Forest Adaptation Resources  Climate Change Tools and Approaches for Land Managers in order to help natural resource managers implement forest adaptation activities  The resources include an adaptation process and workbook that incorporates regional information about climate change vulnerability and potential adaptation strategies into on the ground management tactics that are designed to meet managers   unique objectives  These resources are currently being used in collaboration with a variety of public  private  and tribal natural resource managers to develop projects that implement a diversity of adaptation actions while also meeting management goals  This presentation will describe the process for identifying adaptation actions and showcase efforts where adaptation actions are currently being implemented in forests  We will also discuss challenges  opportunities  and lessons learned that can be applied at different scales and in different sectors       
Adaptation strategies and approaches for forest management A changing climate and associated uncertainties will create new challenges in forest management  In the scientific literature  climate change adaptation is often discussed as an abstract concept  without regard for the fact that decisions in forest management are based on ecological  social  and economic considerations that vary across ownerships and geographies  To address this disconnect  we have developed Forest Adaptation Resources  Climate Change Tools and Approaches for Land Managers  This tool includes a menu of specific and applicable adaptation actions from which managers can select and refine actions that help them meet their management goals and objectives  Over 100 forest adaptation actions were synthesized from peer reviewed and gray literature  expert solicitation  and on the ground adaptation projects  Strategies and approaches were reviewed and refined for their applicability to common forest systems throughout the Midwest  Mid Atlantic  and Northeast  This menu of adaptation actions include options that describe the concepts of resistance  resilience  and response  Millar et al  2007   S trategies describe broad adaptation responses that consider regional ecological and management conditions  Approaches are adaptation responses that can be applied more specifically to a single forest type or community  Tactics are prescriptive actions that are necessarily designed by managers themselves to account for site level conditions and management objectives      the specific actions that implement the adaptation approaches   The result is a menu of adaptation strategies and approaches that are integrated with the adaptation process and workbook  Managers select adaptation strategies and approaches based on their individual management objectives and geographic constraints  and then develop site specific tactics  The adaptation strategies and approaches are currently being applied in forest management to adapt forest ecosystems to a range of anticipated climate conditions and ecosystem impacts  This presentation will describe the strategies and approaches and the benefits of using a menu based hierarchy of adaptation actions       
Designing a forest landscape model that simulates density based stand dynamics at regional scales Niche  and process based models are the primary tools for projecting climate impacts on forests and guiding mitigation efforts  Both approaches lack the capability to include forest landscape processes  FLPs   such as forest management  disturbance  and invasive species  However  these processes can be stronger drivers of forest change than the direct effects of climate  Without incorporating FLPs  predictions of vegetation dynamics may significantly underestimate the magnitude of change at regional scales  Forest landscape models  FLMs  are explicitly designed to simulate FLPs in a spatially interactive manner  To date  they have contributed relatively little to forecasting regional vegetation dynamics because they have been unable to simulate sufficiently large landscapes that are comparable to the size of niche or process model  We present an innovative approach implemented in LANDIS PRO  a variant from LANDIS FLM family  LANDIS PRO simulates forest succession and dynamics by incorporating species   stand   and landscape scale processes  Within each raster cell  the model records number of trees by species age cohort  and size  e g   DBH  for each age cohort is derived from empirical age DBH relationships  The model derives key stand parameters such as basal area  stocking  importance value  biomass and carbon from tree density and size information for each species  We parameterized LANDIS PRO for a large Central Hardwood Region that contains a continuous forested area of over 100 million hectares  including portions of Arkansas  Missouri  Illinois  Indiana  Kentucky  and Ohio  LANDIS PRO simulations were conducted at 90 m resolution with 17000  col  x 7000  row  pixels  over 80 land types  landforms within each ecological subsections   and 16 major tree species  We showed that LANDIS PRO could be directly initialized from nearly a million FIA plots  We also showed that the model could be calibrated against FIA data to constrain the initial landscape and model parameters so that the starting landscape approximated the reality closely  Finally  we showed how model predictions could be evaluated using stand management diagrams  Gingrich stocking charts and Reineke density diagrams   which were based on the basic theories of density dependent behavior of populations including competition  site occupancy  and self thinning  These diagrams are considered as the best available approach to evaluate the long term predicted stand development trajectories  Since LANDIS PRO simulates interactions of fine scale forest succession with FLPs at regional scales  it is possible to evaluate the effects of succession and FLPs on forest change predictions at regional scales  which are made by niche and process models       
What we have learned about wildfires and climate changes In order to understand the effect of climate change on wildfires the causal connections must be established between fire occurrence  spread and behavior  and weather and climate processes  In this talk we will present what is known about boreal forest fire and how they are connected to large scale mid tropospheric anomalies  When these anomalies persist for more than ~15 days  blocking high pressure systems  they create long periods of hot dry surface weather which dry fuels and cause large area burned  Global/hemispheric atmosphere and ocean/atmosphere circulation patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Oscillation  closely linked to the Arctic Oscillation  together or separately explain large amounts of the variation in area burned in the last 40 years in the North American boreal forest  In recent years researchers have begun to understand the coupling of these two oscillators and the El Ni ntilde o Southern Oscillator and the possible effects of climate warming on these patterns       
Forest productivity decline across region and species composition in western Canadian boreal forests Forest productivity has been reported to decline over the past few decades in western boreal forest region  and the declines are attributed to regional warming and drought  By analyzing annual aboveground biomass changes in 871 permanent sampling plots  PSPs  measured from 1958 to 2009  here we addressed  1  whether the decline varies along a drought gradient in this region and 2  whether the decline differs with forest types  To examine climate change associated annual biomass changes  we de trended the effect of stand developmental processes for each of the four forest types  deciduous forests  DEC   early successional conifer forests  ESC   late successional conifer forests  LSC   and mixed forests  MIX  Our results showed that forest productivity declined from 1958 to 2009 for all the forest types  However  the decline rates in dry area were higher than that in wet area  In addition  forest declines differ among forest types with the strongest decline in late successional conifer forests  Further analyses indicated that the forest declines were strongly associated with regional warming and its negative consequence on water availability  Given the drought gradient between the boreal forest and grasslands  our results suggest that the western boreal forest may have undergone retreat at its south edge over last few decades  Our results also indicated a potential climate change induced forest compositional change that is independent of forest development       
Linking forest productivity decline to demographic attributes in western Canadian boreal forest It is evident that climate change has resulted in temporal decline of forest productivity in western boreal forest region  and the decline varies along a drought gradient and among forest types  However  it is uncertain whether the decline is a result of increased tree mortality  reduced growth of surviving trees  reduced ingrowth  or all of the three demographic attributes  By analyzing 871 permanent sampling plots  PSPs  measured from 1958 to 2009  here  we linked temporal changes of forest productivity to the changes of the three demographic attributes  To examine climate change associated annual biomass changes and three demographic attributes  we de trended the effect of stand developmental processes for each of the four forest types  deciduous forests  DEC   early successional conifer forests  ESC   late successional conifer forests  LSC   and mixed forests  MIX  Climate change associated biomass loss due to tree mortality increased significantly for all forest types  The highest increase rate was found for LSC  followed by DEC  MIX and ESC  For DEC  while the overall forest productivity declined  the growth of surviving trees and ingrowth increased significantly and partially compensated the biomass loss due to increased mortality  However  for other three forest types  while biomass loss due to mortality increased  growth of surviving trees and ingrowth also decreased  The Pearson  s correlation analysis indicated that  among three demographic variables  biomass loss due to mortality was the primary driver to the temporal decline of forest productivity  followed by reduced growth of surviving trees and ingrowth  We anticipate our analyses to be a starting point for understanding of how individual demographic attributes might contribute to temporal changes in ecosystem productivity under climate change       
Carbon in Canada  s boreal forest  current status and potential climate change effects Forests remove carbon  C  from the atmosphere and store it in the form of biomass  dead organic matter and soil  while also providing other ecosystem services and meeting society  s demands for products such as timber  wood fiber  and energy  Based on data from Canada  s National Forest Carbon Monitoring  Accounting  and Reporting System  the managed boreal forest  which comprises 53% of the 272 Mha of boreal forest in Canada  currently contains a total ecosystem stock of 28 Pg of C  The difference between two large fluxes  C uptake  net primary production  and C release  heterotrophic respiration   largely determines the net annual change in C stock  with significant additional impacts from anthropogenic and natural disturbances  The managed boreal forest in Canada was a sink of 28 Tg C yr  minus 1 between 1990 and 2008  removing CO 2 from the atmosphere to replace the 17 Tg of C annually harvested and to store an additional 11 Tg of C yr  minus 1 in ecosystem C pools  A large portion  ~57%  of C harvested since 1990 remains stored in wood products and landfill in Canada and abroad  both replacing C emitted from wood harvested before 1990 and contributing to net increases in forest product pools Climate change impacts on forest ecosystem processes in Canada  s boreal forest will become increasingly apparent over the coming decades  and the resulting effects will influence the global C budget and consequently the mitigation effort required to attain atmospheric CO 2 stabilization targets  Increases in temperatures and disturbance rates could result in a large net C source during the remainder of this century and beyond  which may partially be offset by increases in forest productivity  The magnitude and direction of these responses is uncertain  but the evidence available today suggests that the risk is asymmetric  It is unlikely that increases in productivity will be of sufficient magnitude to offset higher emissions from increased disturbances and heterotrophic respiration  Sustained investment into the quantification of forest C dynamics will be required to reduce uncertainty and to track changes in the C balance of Canada  s boreal forest  The 127 Mha of unmanaged boreal forest  where the C balance is currently not known  will require additional attention  as it contains extensive areas of deep organic soils  peatlands  and permafrost containing large quantities of C that may be particularly vulnerable       
Impacts of drought induced forest mortality on Canadian boreal forest carbon sinks The boreal forests  identified as a critical   tipping element   of the Earth  s climate system  play a critical role in the global carbon budget  Recent findings have suggested that terrestrial carbon sinks in northern high latitude regions are weakening  but there has been little observational evidence to support the idea of a reduction of carbon sinks in northern terrestrial ecosystems  In this study  we estimated tree mortality in natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from the using data from long term forest permanent sampling plots and statistical models  and then estimated changes in the biomass carbon sink of natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests We found that tree mortality rates increased by an overall average of 4 7% per year from 1963 to 2008  with higher mortality rate increases in western regions than in eastern regions  about 4 9 and 1 9% per year  respectively   We found that in recent decades  the rate of biomass change decreased significantly in western Canada  Alberta  Saskatchewan  and Manitoba   but there was no significant trend for eastern Canada  Ontario and Quebec   Our results revealed that recent climate change  and especially drought induced tree mortality   due to water stress   is the dominant cause of the observed reduction in the biomass carbon sink  suggesting that western Canada's boreal forests may become net carbon sources if the climate change  induced drought continues to intensify       
Multi year impacts of severe drought on mortality losses of trembling aspen biomass in the western Canadian boreal region There is growing evidence that climate change is already leading to pervasive  drought related increases in tree mortality in many regions around the world  including the North American boreal forest  One of the challenges is distinguishing between changes in tree mortality caused by 1  age related changes in stand dynamics and 2  changes in climatic factors such as drought  Since 2000  we have been monitoring changes in stem mortality within pure trembling aspen   Populus tremuloides   stands at 150 plots across west central Canada  In 2001 2002  a severe  subcontinental drought led to widespread increases in aspen mortality  both in our study region and elsewhere in western North America  Drought severity and extent was quantified using a simple climate moisture index  CMI   and the drought  s impacts were assessed using plot based measurements and tree ring analysis  Mortality was calculated using two methods  as the percentage of stems dying each year  and as the percentage of stand level stem biomass dying each year  The latter was estimated using biomass equations as a function of stem diameter and height  Relative biomass of dying aspen  RBD  was calculated as the mean biomass of recently dead aspen divided by the mean biomass of living aspen  For the study region as a whole  we recorded a 3 fold increase in biomass mortality losses  from 1 3% in 2000 2001 to 4 0% in 2005 2006  The analysis showed high variation in mortality among sites that was significantly related to variation in drought severity  CMI  in 2001 2002  Despite the return to moist conditions in some areas  mortality remained high throughout the subsequent decade  2002 2012   leading to a chronic  regional scale collapse in net biomass increment  In addition to its effects on mortality  the drought led to a change in the size distribution of dying trees  In the moister sites where drought effects were minimal  mortality affected mainly small  suppressed aspen  RBD range from ca  0 3    0 5   reflecting the normal process of self thinning that arises from competition during stand development  In contrast  the more severely drought affected sites showed a shift toward mortality of larger size classes of trees  RBD range 0 7    1 0   Thus  the RBD may provide a useful alternative measure for assessing drought related impacts on mortality of aspen and other species  In general  reporting of mortality as percentage annual loss of biomass rather than percentage loss of stem number is likely to provide a more reliable measure of climate related impacts from plot based measurements       
Early warning signs of biome shift in boreal forests	  Global vegetation models predict that climate warming  and its amplification at high latitudes  will cause species  vegetation communities  and entire biomes to migrate poleward during the 21st century  A biome shift at northern latitudes would affect the world's largest forest zone and potentially accelerate partial thaw of the ~500 Pg organic C currently locked in the top 1 m of Earth's permafrost soils  It could thus not only profoundly impact biodiversity and ecosystem services but also generate feedbacks to the climate system  Here  we review studies of the biological response to historic and ongoing environmental change in boreal and tundra ecosystems to assess whether they support the notion of an initiating biome shift at high latitudes   Long term satellite observations of vegetation productivity show that today's seasonal profile of vegetation activity in high latitude zones resembles that of areas   5 deg  further South 3 decades ago  This geographic shift in vegetation 'seasonality' has occurred in step with climate warming and has allowed establishment and accelerated growth of shrubs in tundra areas previously dominated by non woody species  At the same time  areas of North America's boreal forests show steady declines in vegetation productivity in the past century  In Alaska  comparisons of satellite derived productivity patterns with tree ring data indicate that in the warmer boreal regions  drought is increasingly limiting spruce growth  This inference is supported by observations from the boreal temperate ecotone  where drought has resulted in increased mortality in boreal tree species Together  these findings suggest that patterns of vegetation productivity have generally moved northward as the climate has warmed  but that moisture deficits can quickly impose new limits on plant growth and even survival  Tree mortality as a result of large wildfire years and pest outbreaks has increased as well  Since they cause rapid but profound changes to ecosystems  disturbance events can catalyze ecological regime shifts  particularly if they are accompanied by changing environmental conditions that promote an alternative ecological regime  Severe wild fires in Alaska  for example  are causing decade long shift towards dominance by deciduous tree species in areas previously covered by coniferous forest  Productivity patterns of vegetation display an ongoing northward shift consistent with biome shift  However  predictions of how further climate change will redistribute the boreal biome  need to take into account multiple resource limitations to plant growth and establishment  the role of future disturbance regimes in shaping communities and the pace at which populations can migrate       
Burn severity influences soil microbial responses to wildfire in Alaskan boreal forests Wildfires are a chronic disturbance in boreal forests  and climate warming is likely to increase wildfire frequency and severity  Forest fires create a patchy distribution of burn severities across boreal landscapes  Although previous studies have documented differences in soil microbial communities between burned and unburned boreal forests  few previous studies have accounted for within site variation in burn severity  In this study  we asked how soil microbial responses to fire differ as function of burn severity  To address this question  we sampled fibric and humic soils from 19 locations within a burned boreal forest in interior Alaska  We also collected soils from an adjacent unburned boreal forest  The Landsat derived difference Normalized Burn Ratio  dNBR  was used to estimate burn severity at each sampling point  We measured microbial biomass and basal respiration in each soil sample  In addition  we used pyrosequencing of 18s fungal DNA to characterize fungal community composition at each sampling location Burned fibric soil samples had significantly lower microbial biomass per gram of soil than unburned soil samples   P    0 0001   Differences in burn severity  dNBR  among sampling locations explained a significant amount of the variation in microbial biomass across fibric soil samples  with more severely burned soils having lower microbial biomass   r 2 = 0 834  P    0 0001   In contrast  microbial biomass in humic soils was not significantly different between burned and unburned locations   P = 0 256  and showed no relationship with burn severity   r 2 = 0 135  P = 0 108   Changes in basal respiration among soil samples mirrored differences in microbial biomass  High severity fires may elicit greater reductions in microbial biomass in fibric soils due to higher burn temperatures or increased post fire carbon and water limitation  Forthcoming analyses will determine how fungal community composition varies as a function of burn severity  Taken together  these results suggest that burn severity is an important factor modulating soil biogeochemical responses to boreal forest fires  and they highlight the importance of accounting for landscape level variation in disturbance severity in future studies       
B4WarmED forest warming experiment  shifts in nematode community influence plant cover and composition Global temperature rise and deforestation are key forces driving plant community shifts  such as range shifts of temperate forest species into boreal forests  As range shifts of plant communities are slow to observe  ecotones   boundaries between two ecosystems   are target areas for providing early evidence of ecological responses to warming  The role of soil fauna is however poorly explored in ecotones  although positive and negative effects of soil fauna on plant species can influence plant community structure and hence can provide insights into the mechanisms of range shifts  We studied nematode communities encompassing key trophic groups of soil food webs in response to experimentally increased temperature  ambient  +1 8 deg C  +3 6 deg C  in soils of closed canopy and open  recently harvested  forest stands in the temperate boreal forest ecotone of Minnesota  USA at two experimental sites  Cloquet and Ely and calculated various established nematode indices  Additionally  we estimated species specific coverage of herbaceous and shrub species from the same experimental plots and examined if changes in nematode community are significantly associated with plant community productivity and structure Individual trophic groups did not differ among temperature treatments  but the ratio between microbial feeding and plant feeding nematodes increased significantly with temperature rise in both undisturbed  closed canopy  and harvested  open  areas  Such a change could contribute to better plant performance if predation pressure on microbes led to higher nutrient availability  We found that the increase in this ratio was positively related to the total coverage of herbaceous and shrub plant species  a proxy for plant community productivity  Further  multivariate analyses revealed that temperature rise consistently shaped understory herbaceous and shrub plant communities in both closed canopy and recently cleared areas  Our findings suggest that shifts in nematode community structure in response to temperature rise and forest harvest may alter plant performance and community structure in ecotone regions  Notably  these results were consistent across the two distinct experimental sites  We thus conclude that future studies should consider changes in both aboveground and belowground communities as well as potential interactions between those to improve understanding of plant community shifts  including their range shifts  in ecotone regions in response to global change       
B4WarmED forest warming experiment  Species geographic distributions predict photosynthetic responses of local ecotypes to climate warming Given rapid climate warming it is critical to assess how local ecotypes of important species will respond  and whether the broader distributions of species indicate anything about the capacity of local ecotypes to do so  One example involves photosynthetic carbon gain in boreal forest species  which we tested in B4WarmED  Boreal Forest Warming at an Ecotone in Danger   a manipulative open air warming experiment in open and closed canopy habitats at two sites in northeastern Minnesota  The experiment includes 72 7 1 m 2 plots and uses infrared heat lamps and soil heating cables to heat continuously during the growing season  Our goal was to compare responses of photosynthesis to in situ warming for local ecotypes of 10 temperate and boreal tree species  and one woody invader  grown under two temperature regimes  ambient and warmed +3 4  deg C both belowground and aboveground   We aimed to determine whether local ecotypes of all species respond equally to warming or whether boreal species with more northerly distributions respond more negatively than temperate species  Light saturated photosynthetic rates in morning or early afternoon were measured in 2009  2010  and 2011 in situ from a subsample of the 11 600 seedlings planted in 2008 A total of   4 400 measurements were across species  treatments  sites  and time  Over three growing seasons  warming by 3 4  deg C decreased photosynthesis of the common boreal species but increased photosynthesis in locally uncommon temperate species  The six southern boreal species  spruce  fir  pines  birch  and aspen  performed poorly with warming   15% on average   while the temperate maples and oaks  and the exotic buckthorn    showed enhanced photosynthesis  by +15 % on average   Response to warming was more positive for species with more southerly abundance   asymp 200 km scale  and/or range limits  Despite large differences in distributions  all 11 species co occur in northern Minnesota  thus in theory if fully adapted locally  local ecotypes of each should have responded similarly to warming  They did not   as the temperate species performed better with warming than the boreal species  hence key aspects of their biology are reflected in their geographic distributions  Such evidence is consistent with the notion that in the southern boreal forest  warming will degrade the competitive ability of currently dominant boreal species  especially when compared to those presently rare co occurring species that are common in warmer neighboring regions  and suggests that broader geographic distributions do indeed predict differential response to climate warming       
Making do with less  The effects of chronic predation stress on immune function Exposure to predators shifts many animals into an emergency life history stage  The resulting behavioural and physiological changes increase the likelihood that an individual will be able to evade a predator  On the other hand  long term     chronic  exposure to predators is thought to induce a   chronic stress   state that is maladaptive  However  another perspective suggests that the changes that occur during chronic exposure to predators allow the animal to optimize function  and fitness  given sub optimal conditions  For example  the effect of chronic predator stress on disease resistance may reflect physiological trade offs required to maintain an animal  s flight or fight capacity  We examined the effects of chronic predator     praying mantid  exposure on reproductive output  anti predator behaviour  and immune function in the cricket  Gryllus texensis   Crickets were housed in one of 3 conditions  with a praying mantid   Mantis religiosa    with a stick insect   Carausius morosus   non predator  or without another species  Measurements were made before and after each 3 week trial  Preliminary results show that crickets housed with a mantid laid fewer eggs compared with controls and spent more time in shelter in an anti predator behavioural trial  Total phenoloxidase  an enzyme important for immune function  did not differ in activity across groups  Induction of phenoloxidase activity  however  was greater in the mantid exposed group  Glutathione levels were also lower in mantid exposed crickets than in controls  The data from this study will be combined with data previously collected in this laboratory and incorporated into a physiological network model  The model will be used to examine whether physiological changes leading to a reallocation of resources to flight or fight behaviours correlate with those that reduce the negative effects of this reallocation on immune function  Instead of being   maladaptive    changes that occur during chronic exposure to predators may reflect a physiological system optimized for sub optimal conditions       
 Predicting variation in behavioral  physiological  and developmental responses to predation risk  We seek a predictive framework for when non consumptive effects of predators on prey will be strong  Here I will consider how both environmental conditions and traits of prey may influence prey responses to predation risk  and that individual prey can deploy multiple behavioral  physiological and developmental responses to maintain growth while avoiding predation  We measured phenotypic variation in Colorado potato beetles in response to predation risk and how these responses are altered by host plant resistance  Specifically  eggs from Colorado potato beetle sibships were reared in predation risk or control environments on high or low resistance plants  We used potato plants treated with a foliar application of jasmonic acid to enhance plant resistance  On each plant type we exposed Colorado potato beetle larvae to predaceous stink bugs   Podisus maculiventris    including either   lethal   predators or sham predators with their mouthparts surgically altered to prevent killing  We measured CPB responses to the predator over their lifetime and fitness We found 3 fold phenotypic variation between sibships in consumption and growth rate in the control treatment  Sibships varied in their type of response to predation risk  with 9 of 14 sibships reducing feeding and 5 of 14 sibships increasing assimilation efficiency in the predation risk treatment compared to controls  Mean sibship growth rate in the absence of predation was strongly correlated with their behavioral response to predation risk  Beetles on high resistance plants had a weaker response to predation risk  Beetles whose siblings grew the most quickly in the absence of predators were the ones that reduced feeding the most in the presence of predators  Increasing assimilation efficiency in the predation risk treatment was not associated with growth rate  Overall  environmental conditions and prey traits that promote rapid growth are associated with stronger responses to the predator       
The neurobiological ecology of fear	  Fear of predators  and predation risk  have become almost synonymous in the ecological literature  Some authors object that referring to fear in other animals is anthropomorphic  and others object because the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation remain unknown in virtually all studies of 'the ecology of fear'  We too object  but on the basis that failing to consider   fear of predators    as a phenomenon distinct from predation risk  may be limiting our understanding of ecology  Referring to fear when discussing predation risk in algae  for example  is evidently incongruous    having a nervous system would seem to be a minimum requirement to   feel   fear  Not only is fear something that can be measured in the brain  as has long been established  new biomedical research suggests that   fear of predators   can itself be measured in the brain  A Nature Neuroscience Review published last year documented that fear of predators is processed by a distinct neural circuit  independent of those activated by fear of an aggressive conspecific  or fear of pain  This progress has been made in part because exposure to a predator is now the most common stressor used in studying the animal model of post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   We will discuss the benefits and challenges of translating neurobiological findings in the lab to ecological research in the field  Measuring fear effects in the brain can help clarify the interpretation of peripheral physiological measures like glucocorticoids levels    elevated glucocorticoids can be unambiguously attributed to predator induced stress if accompanied by activation of the   fear of predators   neural circuit  More importantly  the fact that predator exposure can have long lasting effects on the brain resembling those seen in PTSD patients provides a compelling link between fear of predators and likely effects of demography  The simplest challenge to overcome is collecting brain tissue in the field  More challenging is whether predator effects on brain activity will be identifiable  since unlike in the lab where all other stimuli are eliminated  animals in the field are subject to myriad stimuli  Most challenging is simply where to look in the brains of species other than rats and humans  For example  to explore the neurobiological ecology of fear in our lab  in relation to the effects we have already documented on the physiology  behaviour and demography of songbirds  we are presently at the stage of endeavouring to identify the   fear centre   in the avian brain       
 Prey nutritional condition  A common influence of antipredator behavior and the   ecology of fear     A prey animal  s quandary is to survive predation while also eating enough food to meet its energy requirements  The behavioral tradeoff between these two needs is mediated by prey body condition  Many ecological conditions and biological processes  such as resource scarcity and reproduction  tend to reduce prey body condition  A large body of theory predicts that when prey animals are in poor condition  and are pressed by hunger  their antipredator behaviors are weak or nonexistent  The dependency of antipredator behavior on body condition might commonly introduce bottom up limitations on predation risk effects  Although familiar to behavioral ecologists  the mediating role of prey body condition has yet to be integrated into our conceptualization of the population  and community level effects of predation risk  We synthesized theoretical and empirical studies that explored the influence of body condition on antipredator behavior across a variety of systems  We found that predictions of a well known patch use model of Brown and Kotler  2004   where antipredator behaviors are predicated partly on the marginal value of new energy gained by prey  was broadly supported by studies of fish  mammals  birds  reptiles  amphibians  and invertebrates  In 96%  44/46  of the studies  prey animals with high energy reserves responded more strongly to a predation stimulus than individuals with low energy reserves  This relationship was robust to differences in study design  including differences in the manipulation of prey condition and predation risk  and in the specific behavioral response being measured  We use several examples from recent studies of temperate ungulates  which experience strong seasonal and interannual nutritional bottlenecks  to illustrate these findings  Antipredator behaviors can carry costs for prey populations and benefits for the plant communities they feed upon  and these risk effects are thought to be strong and widespread  However  we suggest that the countervailing influence of bottom up limitations on prey body condition and behavior    largely overlooked to date in studies conducted at the population and community level    must be more fully integrated into existing theory if we are to fully resolve the context dependency of predation risk effects       
The adaptive potential of material stress	  Biomedical researchers have long appreciated that maternal stressors can induce preparative and adaptive programming in offspring via exposure to maternally derived stress  namely maternaly derived Glucocorticoids  GCs   However  few ecologists are aware of the capacity for maternal GC exposure to translate ecological and environmental stressors into preparative and adaptive programmed offspring responses in free living systems  We will review an emerging body of experimental field work indicating that circulating maternal GCs link ecological stressors to adaptive offspring plasticity  We attempt to emphasize that natural and human induced ecological stressors can play a fundamental role in altering the capacity of individuals and therefore populations to respond to both predictable and unpredictable ecological change via translating maternal adversity into responsive phenotypic plasticity in a number of vertebrate models  Results from a number of free living vertebrate systems reveals that although maternally derived stress induces seemingly negative investment trade offs in offspring  these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better match the offspring to future environments  however  responses can indeed prove maladaptive if they unreliably predict      are mismatched to  future environments  Furthermore  these same stress induced adjustments that may indeed prove maladaptive for individual offspring can actually provide adaptive benefits to mothers by reducing current reproductive investment and benefitting lifetime reproductive success  Overall  our reccomendation to ecologists is that to properly determine the adaptive potential of maternally derived stress  researchers must take a broader integrated life history perspective  appreciate immediate and longer term environmental context of the stress  and examine lifetime offspring and maternal fitness       
Defense physiology  implications for prey trophic function and nutrient recycling The physiological reaction of prey to predation involves allocating resources from production to support emergency functions  An example of such a reaction is an increase in maintenance respiration concomitant with higher carbohydrate and lower N demand  Such changes in prey energy and elemental budget should alter the role prey play in regulating the quality of detrital inputs to soils  Nutrient content of detritus is an important determinant of the way soil communities regulate ecosystem processes  Thus  the physiological reaction of prey to predation can potentially explicate changes in ecosystem functioning  First empirical examination using an old field model food chain of an herbivore grasshopper  prey  and a predatory spider  thus far  support this new conceptual framework  Grasshoppers stressed by spider predators prefer to eat more carbohydrates and have a higher body carbon to nitrogen ratio than do grasshoppers raised without spiders  This change in elemental content does not slow grasshopper decomposition but perturbs belowground community function  decelerating the subsequent decomposition of plant litter  This legacy effect of predation on soil community function appears to be regulated by the amount of herbivore protein entering the soil  Using a 13 C pulse chase experiment in the same model system  we found that carnivore presence enhanced initial carbon fixation by plants and slowed the relative rate of carbon loss via ecosystem respiration  These changes in carbon cycling led to 1 4 times more carbon storage in above ground and below ground plant biomass when carnivores were present compared to conditions with just herbivores       
Predation risk and the metabolic stoichiometry of Trinidadian guppies   Poecilia reticulata    Consequences for foraging strategies and life history traits By addressing the need for prey to balance demand for multiple chemical substrates  multi currency ecological frameworks   e g    ecological stoichiometry  nutritional geometry  are providing novel insights into predator prey dynamics  Predators often induce stress in prey that increases their demand for carbon  C  lipids and carbohydrates  relative to nitrogen  N  amino acids   This shift in metabolic demand may change the C N of preferred foods  tissues  and feces of prey with implications for organism  community  and ecosystem dynamics  We explored the effects of predation risk on the metabolic stoichiometry of Trindadian guppies   Poecilia reticulata   and the corresponding implications for their trophic ecology  We exposed guppies to simulated predation risk by introducing kairomones from the guppy predator Crenicichla sp   We assessed the influence of predators on the C N of guppy metabolism by measuring resting oxygen  O  and N metabolism  We used atomic O N ratios to describe the proportion of guppy metabolism comprised of nitrogen compounds  We also measured the influence of predators on guppy trophic efficiency over a seven week period by feeding individual guppies ad libitum amounts of either high C N  high lipid  or low C N  high protein  foods and measuring both food consumption and fish growth  Cue exposed guppies had higher metabolic O N than guppies not exposed to predator cues  indicating predation risk reduced N use for metabolism  In the seven week growth study  predation risk altered the nutrient specific foraging of guppies  Without predation risk  guppies fed to C satiation  No cue guppies on high C N diets ingested comparable amounts of C but less N than those reared on low C N diets  Cue exposed guppies  however  fed to N satiation  Cue exposed guppies fed high C N food consumed more C and not less N than guppies fed low C N food  Though predation risk did not strongly affect carbon trophic efficiency  it was the primary driver of nitrogen trophic efficiency  Guppies exposed to predator cues were more efficient at turning ingested N into tissue than those reared without predator cues  These results suggest the currency driving guppy trophic behavior changed with predation risk  Non risk exposed guppies fed to meet C demand  but  with predator cues  guppies fed to meet N demand and retained ingested N at a higher rate  It is unclear whether this shift is adaptive conservation of N for growth under predator restricted foraging or a general physiological response of guppies to food restriction       
The dimensions of fear  Can we link genes to ecosystems  Predator effects on prey demography have traditionally been ascribed solely to direct killing in studies of population ecology and wildlife management  Predation risk of course affects the physiology and behaviour of prey but such effects have largely been ignored in wildlife conservation and management because there remains no ready means of quantifying whether and to what extent predation risk affects prey numbers  We have conducted two large scale field experiments conclusively demonstrating that predation risk alone     fear itself  can affect the demography of free living wildlife  In both cases we assessed effects on both physiology and behaviour  We know the effects on physiology and behaviour were due to predation risk and we know they were associated with effects on demography  because we conducted manipulative experiments  Our results answer the theoretical question of whether fear itself is powerful enough to affect wildlife population dynamics  and consequently have conservation implications  However  to be of practical value we need to be able to say that this or that measure of physiology or behaviour is most predictive of there being significant fear effects on demography  and that ignoring fear effects thus risks underestimating the total impact of predators We have assayed the effects of predation risk on a variety of physiological measures  including glucocorticoid and corticosteroid binding globulin levels  oxidative status and antioxidant capacity  Measuring glucocorticoids has proven particularly unproductive because it is possible to interpret any change in glucocorticoids as either beneficial or deleterious  To overcome such vagaries in the interpretation of any given index  our approach has been to measure multiple physiological variables  and use multivariate statistical procedures  Measuring multiple   risk factors   is common practice in medicine and seems the most sensible means of evaluating the likelihood that fear affects demography  However  other results from our experiments suggest this may not be as cost effective as assaying crude measures of condition  e g  fat score  or measuring behaviour  rather than physiology  Part of the challenge lies in trying to link changes in physiology and behaviour that may vary from minute to minute or hour to hour  with demographic processes such as reproduction or death from malnutrition  that take days or weeks  One solution may be to assay measures of lasting damage  such as oxidative damage to DNA or the attrition of telomeres  We are presently testing whether predation risk causes such lasting genetic damage  and hence whether we can link fear effects on genes to effects on ecosystems       
Spatial scale mediates carnivore coexistence in a   landscape of fear   Predators can affect prey populations by stimulating costly defense strategies  trait mediated indirect interactions  or TMIIs   Meta analyses indicate these behavioral responses can have greater demographic impacts on prey populations than direct mortality  even triggering cascading effects across trophic levels  However  despite significant research examining the role of TMIIs in predator prey coexistence  the role of TMIIs in driving intraguild predator predator coexistence is largely unexamined  Here we examine how aggressive interactions create a   landscape of fear   within a guild of African predators  and the implications of this landscape for intraguild predator coexistence  We first compare joint population dynamics of lions  cheetahs  and African wild dogs using 40 years of time series data from Serengeti National Park  We then examine patterns of habitat use across a range of spatial scales for evidence of displacement of cheetahs and wild dogs from preferred habitats  using a combination of citizen science processed camera trap data  200 single camera stations across   1 000km 2    and radio telemetry locations for lions and cheetahs  concurrently tracked 1985 1990   Finally  we cross validate our results from the Serengeti with data on coexistence between lions  cheetahs and wild dogs following reintroduction programs in 30 private game reserves in South Africa Our results demonstrate radically different responses of subordinate species in both temporal population trends and spatial habitat use  highlighting the importance of TMIIs in driving intraguild predator coexistence  The Serengeti lion population increased nearly three fold between 1966 and 1998  likely contributing to the elimination African wild dogs but having no apparent effect on cheetah numbers  Wild dogs were lower in years of high lion density  p  0 0001  r 2 =0 63   while cheetah numbers were unrelated  p=0 19  r sq=0 09   Whereas wild dogs show large scale avoidance of lions  cheetahs do not succumb to displacement from preferred habitats  Notably  cheetahs were positively spatially correlated with lions across the study area  p  0 0001  and instead demonstrate fine scale habitat partitioning while inside lion territories  increasing their use of more open habitats  Similarly  across South Africa  wild dog densities were lower in reserves with more lions  while cheetah numbers were unrelated  These findings suggest that while TMIIs can result in large scale displacement of subordinates from preferred habitats  fine scale partitioning facilitates coexistence by minimizing displacement and associated habitat loss  Examining landscape partitioning across spatial scales in other systems with and without suppression would provide a more comprehensive understanding of how avoidance behavior and habitat characteristics interact to promote species coexistence       
Anti predatory response of Daphnia to an invasive predatory cladoceran and ensuing non consumptive effects  Influence of seasonally changing environmental variables and predator density Nonconsumptive effects  NCEs  the focus of   the ecology of fear    can be as large as the consumptive effects of predators  The relative contribution of non consumptive effects can vary greatly on the nature of the predator prey interaction  the density of predator and prey  and environmental context  Estimating the magnitude of nonconsumptive effects in the field is therefore a challenge  Previous lab experiments indicate that Daphnia mendotae can perceive chemical cues from an invasive predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes and respond by migrating to deeper  colder waters  We examined Daphnia's vertical position response     mean depth  to Bythotrephes in Lake Michigan at different points in the season and over 6 years between 2004 06 and 2009 11  We further measured environmental variables  e g  light  temperature  to examine if these factors influence the response of Daphnia to Bythotrephes   and to estimate costs of the response     NCEs   We use an optimization model  which balances predation risk and growth rate  to predict results   Consistent with the optimization model  Daphnia displays a nearly uniform deep migration above an intermediate Bythotrephes density  other environmental variables therefore have little influence  At lower Bythotrephes density  in contrast  the vertical position     mean depth  of Daphnia is strongly correlated with environmental variables  including deeper distributions with increased Secchi depth  a measure of light levels  and shallower distributions with increased epiliminion  warmer upper water layer  depth  The relationship between Bythotrephes density and the magnitude of the phenotypic response of Daphnia has large effects on CEs and NCEs  The NCE of Bythotrephes on Daphnia increases as a saturating function of Bythotrephes density  whereas the CE decreases as a function of Bythotrephes density  The relative contribution of the NCE to the net effect of the predator therefore increases dramatically at higher Bythotrephes density  The relative contribution of the NCE changes seasonally  as the costs of the phenotypic response are dependent on changes in the vertical temperature gradient  Our results elucidate how Bythotrephes affects zooplankton in Lake Michigan  s food web  and  more generally  the dependence of predator density and environmental context on the relative contribution of NCEs to the net effect of the predator       
 Overview of the 2013 US National Climate Assessment  with special reference to impacts of climate change on ecosystems  hydrology  and urban areas of the Southwest  The 2013 United States National Climate Assessment  NCA  evaluated the current and projected future impacts of global climate change on eight US regions  including the Southwest   seven sectors  and eight issues that cut across sectors or geographic regions  Of particular relevance to the Southwest  the assessment included land use and cover change  energy  water  and land  urban infrastructure and vulnerabilities  and impacts on the lands and resources of native peoples as cross sectoral issues  Each chapter drew on technical input received from hundreds of scientists from academia  non governmental organizations  business  and government  reflecting the most current research findings in each area  The US Global Change Research Program  which coordinated the NCA  has organized a network including many of these contributors that is intended to draw upon their expertise to sustain and update the assessment over the long term  For this presentation  I provide an overview of the NCA and draw from the chapters mentioned above to synthesize impacts relevant to the intersection of ecosystems  hydrologic systems  and urban areas of the Southwest In January 2013  the 60 member NCA Development and Advisory Committee released the NCA report for public comment  comment period ended in April 2013   with 30 chapters written by 240 authors  The report makes a strong statement with overwhelming evidence that climate is changing and affecting people of the US  Yet the impacts of climate change can be difficult to assess against a background of other globally prevalent and mainly anthropogenic changes that interact with climate change  In the Southwest in particular  the enormous interannual variability in climate and rapid urbanization  with attendant changes in hydrologic systems  confound attempts to attribute observed changes to global climate change  As examples  I contrast 1  the changes in streamflow expected due to climate change with changes already observed under urbanization  and 2  the impact of the urban wildland interface on fire frequency with increases attributed to climate change  A conceptual model for impacts of interacting multiple stressors associated with urbanization  hydrologic change  and climate change on ecosystems will be presented  Knowing how to untangle such interactions of multiple anthropogenic changes will be useful in adaptation planning and mitigation strategies       
Resistance and resilience of riverine systems in the southwestern U S  to climate change Riverine ecosystems in the southwestern US have historically been driven by hydrologic extremes  Water plays multiple roles in these systems  functioning as a limiting resource during dry periods in riparian zones and intermittent reaches  while creating catastrophic disturbance during flood events in both rivers and riparian zones  Flooding and drying events structure food webs and ecosystem dynamics in these linked systems  Specific species traits and behaviors can help increase system resistance and resilience to floods and drying in heterogeneous basins Southwestern US riverine ecosystems may be fairly resistant and resilient to some degree of climate change in basins with variable habitat and low levels of human modification  However  extreme climate change  especially when combined with intensive human homogenization of basin conditions  may lower system resistance and resilience  fundamentally altering whole basins       
 Land cover change in the Southwest  Wildfire risk  drought induced tree mortality  and the convergence of climate  land management  and disturbance trends in regional forests and woodlands  Extensive high severity wildfires and drought induced tree mortality have intensified over the last 2 decades in southwestern US forests and woodlands  on a scale unseen regionally since at least pre 1900  Abundant and diverse paleo ecological and historical sources indicate substantial variability in Southwest fire regimes and forest patterns over the past ~10 000 years  providing context for recent fire and vegetation trends  In particular  over the past ~150 years regional forest landscapes and fire regimes have responded sensitively  strongly  and in understandable ways to changes in human land management  as well as to interactions with climate variability and trends  Widespread  high frequency surface fire activity ceased on most Southwest landscapes in the late 1800s due to changed land use patterns  As a result  woody plant establishment exploded into the 1900s  fostered by several favorable wet climate windows for tree regeneration and growth  and fire suppression  By the early 1990s many Southwest forests likely were near their maximum potential levels of tree density and biomass storage  and had reached unsustainable conditions  New research derives a forest drought stress index  FDSI  for the Southwest using a comprehensive tree ring growth data set representing AD 1000  2007  driven by warm season temperature and cold season precipitation Strong correspondence exists between FDSI and forest productivity  tree mortality  bark beetle outbreaks  and wildfire in the Southwest  illustrating the interactions among climate  land use history  and disturbance processes in this region  Recent increases in severe wildfires and overall tree mortality in response to early 21 st century warmth and drought conditions suggest that a transition of southwestern forest landscapes toward more open and drought tolerant ecosystems may already be underway  If regional temperatures increase as projected by climate models  the mean forest drought stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1 000 years  Multiple lines of evidence now foreshadow 21 st century changes in forest structures and compositions to novel distributions in the Southwest  Cascading ecological effects and drivers of these interactive landscape changes are presented  along with adaptation strategies to enhance ecosystem resilience in the context of ongoing and projected climate trends       
 The consequences of delayed flowering phenology in a sky island plant  pointleaf manzanita  Climate change induced shifts in flowering phenology can alter both the biotic and abiotic environment experienced by plants  potentially leading to decreased temporal overlap with pollinators and exposure to conditions that negatively affect fruit and seed set  We explored the relationship between flowering phenology and reproductive output in pointleaf manzanita   Arctostaphylos pungens   in a sky island habitat in the Sonoran Desert  Although pointleaf manzanita is one of the first plants to bloom in our study area  long term records suggest flowering is shifting later  To determine the consequences of among  and within plant variation in flowering time  we documented the flowering schedules of 52 plants in our study population and followed the fates of individual flowers throughout two seasons  2012 and 2013   We also measured visitation rates by potential pollinators  We harvested fruits to determine fruit mass and seed set of flowers produced at different times  The patterns we documented indicate that  if pointleaf manzanita flowering continues to shift later  the flowering season may be shorter  fewer total fruits may be produced per plant  and those fruits may weigh less and contain smaller seeds  The date of flowering onset  date of flower production  number of co flowering plants  and visitation rate all significantly affected fruit set  Individual flowering schedules were consistent between years  suggesting that plants that begin flowering late have lower reproductive output each year  These results demonstrate that delayed phenology in a long lived plant affects pollination success and reproduction and highlight the value of using natural variation in flowering time to determine the consequences of phenological shifts       
Building partnerships to deliver applied science to natural resource managers  Case studies from southwestern Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Landscape Conservation Cooperatives  LCCs  were launched in 2010 as public private partnerships with the goal of sustaining fish and wildlife and other natural resources in the face of increasing environmental threats  including climate change  Through facilitating identification of shared landscape scale planning needs and desired outcomes among a diverse group of resource managers  self directed LCCs seek to integrate and translate science and provide decision support tools for on the ground conservation applications  The presentation includes case studies from the southwest that illustrate how LCCs are fostering novel alliances  effectively reducing scientific uncertainty  and providing tools to help managers make decisions in the face of climate change  In the Gulf Coast Prairie LCC geography  sea level rise and decreased freshwater flows converge in a region experiencing large demographic changes  Wildlife managers  in particular  are working to use science  including inventory and monitoring  to identify conservation actions effective in sustaining wildlife populations in the face of these threats  Effectively applying science requires innovative approaches and the Desert LCC is working to adapt its collaborative processes to meet the needs of its diverse partnership and stakeholders  Some of these approaches and their early results will be shared       
Seeking Leopold's Quadrant  How do we foster research that addresses needs of resource management decision makers 	  Adaptation to climate change represents an intersection of many professional and disciplinary cultures  and hence comprises a sociological and political challenge as much as a technical one  Broadly defined  two contrasting groups are critical to successful adaptation  the community of climate science researchers  concentrated in universities and science agencies  and the community of resource management decision makers  dispersed among federal and state management agencies  NGOs  and private entities  Decision makers are often trained in scientific research  and many researchers hope that their work will influence real world decisions  In spite of this common ground  relevant scientific knowledge is often applied ineffectively or not at all  while information needs of decision makers can remain unaddressed by researchers  These problems arise from a number of sources  including the differing calendars of decision making and research  the contrasting professional reward structures for researchers and managers  and perhaps most of all the mutual lack of understanding between the communities  Researchers often lack knowledge of the context in which decisions are made and the most effective ways to provide scientific findings  while decision makers are frequently unaware of the current state of the science  including capacities for accurate forecasting and the associated uncertainties  Despite these challenges  numerous case studies exist wherein research has been applied directly and effectively to management decisions in climate change adaptation  Successful cases in the Southwest include studies from seemingly remote academic domains such as paleontology and paleoclimatology  A common element of such successful applications has been direct  patient  and persistent engagement between researchers and decision makers  A looming challenge is to determine the extent to which generalizations can be drawn from existing case studies    both the successes and the failures  An emerging   science of the practice    in which the processes of information exchange and engagement are studied  should lead to identification of a set of   best practices   for both researchers and decision makers  This should lead in turn to full realization of   Leopold  s Quadrant    a domain where user inspired research  capable of broad application  is mobilized and applied effectively to address the urgent needs of climate adaptation and other environmental problems       
Importance of information transfer and facilitating effective dialogue	  The combination of sustained drought  rapid ecosystem changes  such as widespread forest mortality across western North America  and land use changes associated with rapid urban population growth has motivated concern among ecosystem managers about the implications of future climate changes for the landscapes which they manage  Through literature review  surveys  and workshop discussions  we assess the process of moving from concern  to planning  to action  with a particular emphasis on science communication and questions  such as  What are the roles of boundary organizations in facilitating knowledge exchange  Which practices lead to effective interactions between scientists  decision makers  and knowledge brokers Although there is no   one size fits all   science communication method  we argue that the co production of science and policy by research scientists  science translators  and decision makers  as co equals  is a resource intensive  but effective practice for moving adaptation planning forward  We give examples from seasonal forecast communication  drought planning  and processes of climate adaptation planning  In general  we find that constructive approaches make use of alliances with early adopters and opinion leaders  and make strong communication links between predictions  impacts and solutions  Resource managers need  a  information on the basics of regional climate variability and global climate change   b  region specific projections of climate changes and their impacts   c  frank discussion of an array of uncertainties  and  d  opportunities for candid exploration of these topics with peers and subject experts  Research scientists play critical roles in adaptation planning discussions  because the results of their research forms a basis to inform policy change  they assist resource managers in clarifying the cascade of interactions leading to potential impacts and  importantly  because decision makers want to hear the information straight from the scientists conducting the research    which bolsters credibility  Climate change projections and research alone are not enough to motivate change  because the peer reviewed literature requires interpretation and decision makers lack the time to keep up with the sheer volume of publications  We find that uncertainty  formerly a topic to avoided  forms the foundation for constructive progress in adaptation planning  Candid exploration of the array of uncertainties  which includes those due to modeling  institutional  policy and economic factors    with decision making peers  science translators  and subject experts  stimulates constructive thinking on adaptation strategies  A combination of estimates of future climate/environment states and discussion support to explore multiple future scenarios and research nuances advances the discussion beyond   uncertainty paralysis         
Impact of extreme soil moisture changes and decreased daily temperature fluctuations on microbial community structure Reduction in daily temperature variability has been predicted as one of the side effects of climate change in many climate models  Different field studies have supported the predictions by observing the increase of daily minimum temperatures at a significantly higher rate than daily maximum temperatures  Although this aspect of climate change has been addressed scantily in plant physiology  how the reduction in daily temperature range  DTR  affects belowground processes is poorly understood  To study microbial community response to the decrease in DTR of soil  DTR soil    a study was initiated in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend NP  Texas in 2006 and is currently ongoing  Polyethylene shade cloths were suspended above the soil surface for reducing DTR soil on ten 4X3m plots  which were referred as shade plots  This design reduced solar radiation but allowed normal precipitation infiltration and airflow  Uncovered plots of the same dimension were considered control plots  Soil microbial community structure was evaluated on the basis of phospholipid fatty acid  PLFA  profiles  Additionally  activities of enzymes involved in carbon  nitrogen  and phosphorus acquisition were evaluated DTR soil was reduced by 2 6 deg C in the shaded plots with increased daily minimum temperature and lower daily maximum temperature without a change in soil moisture status  The decrease in DTR soil increased the concentrations of total PLFA  Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria  and AM fungi significantly   P    0 05   Higher number and concentration of PLFA was observed when conditions were drier  At 4% soil moisture total number of PLFA indicators detected was reduced by about 40% compared to the average soil moisture status of 1 5% and total PLFA concentration was reduced by more than 50%  Activities of phosphodiesterase were strongly negatively correlated with total PLFA concentrations  The enzymes  beta  glucosidase   beta  glucosaminidase  alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase had significantly higher activities in the reduced DTR soil plots  shade plots  than in the control plots   P    0 05   These results show that continuous reduction in DTR soil may increase the abundance of bacteria and AM fungi  Aside from potential changes to microbial community structure under conditions of reduced DTR soil   nutrient cycling rates could be increased due to higher enzyme activities in this arid system       
 Water limited ecohydrology and carbon sink source dynamics of desert grasslands and shrublands during dry years  Chihuahuan Desert  USA 	  State change of grassland to shrubland is a concern for the viability of arid ecosystems worldwide  Differences in grassland and shrubland functioning result in altered landscape scale responses and carbon uptake patterns when ecosystem state change occurs  and these differences may be exacerbated in future climate scenarios  In this research we characterized the hydrology and ecology of native C 4 mixed blue grama   Bouteloua gracilis   and black grama   B  eriopoda   grassland and C 3 creosote   Larrea tridentata   shrubland in the northern Chihuahuan Desert  USA  during a drier than average period from 2007 2011  Our primary goal was to determine the patterns and causes of carbon sink source dynamics at grassland and shrubland sites using aboveground and belowground measurements of net primary productivity and flux tower measurements of carbon exchange    Grassland and shrubland carbon sink source patterns from 2007 2011 differed from each other at daily  seasonal and annual timescales and were influenced by a number of biotic and abiotic variables  Grasslands were a carbon source in all years except for 2010  while shrublands were a carbon sink in all years  This difference is driven by high grassland surface respiration at daily  annual and seasonal timescales  which may be a legacy effect of belowground stored carbon  Differences in sink strength are also facilitated by a significantly longer growing season in shrublands  P    0 05  than in grasslands  Shrubland carbon fluxes are less sensitive to fluctuations in soil moisture and surface energy exchange during the growing season than grasses  although C 4 grasses have a higher ecosystem water use efficiency  If changing patterns of winter and monsoon precipitation result in greater seasonal variance in water availability in the future  this may highly favor shrublands over grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert and other similar ecoregions       
 Semi arid grassland plant community responses to 7 years of experimental warming  elevated CO 2   and irrigation  Grasslands cover 30 40% of the Earth  s terrestrial surface and constitute the largest intact biome in the conterminous US  Semi arid grasslands are expected to be particularly sensitive to climate change because of the overriding control of soil moisture on virtually all ecological processes in these ecosystems  Over 7 years in the Prairie Heating and CO 2 Enrichment  PHACE  experiment in the mixed grass prairie ecosystem of southeastern Wyoming USA  we evaluated how manipulations of soil moisture and elevated atmospheric CO 2 and temperature influenced plant community composition and species dominance patterns  We predicted that in dry years  increasing soil moisture and elevated CO 2 would have similar effects on plant community composition  but we expected to see those effects diminished in wet years  In contrast  we expected warming to counteract the effects of elevated CO 2   In addition to the effects on plant community composition  global change may have a destabilizing effect on community composition  We assessed how the global change factors affect community stability and in particular  determined whether resistance to change depended on the initial plant community  Overall plant community composition shifted over the 7 years of global change manipulations  and a divergence in plant community composition among the PHACE treatments was apparent  The direction and magnitude of the global change effects differed among years and also between the dominant and subdominant community members  Differences in plant community composition among treatments were more pronounced in drier years  In addition  the relative biomass of dominant species decreased in the elevated CO 2 plots over time and the relative biomass of subdominant species proportionally increased  Compositional dissimilarity decreased over time in plots that received both elevated CO 2 and warming treatments  suggesting that these plots became more similar to each other over the course of the experiment  We did not find significant direct effects of altered soil moisture on most plant community measures  Our results suggest elevated CO 2 and warming have very different effects on plant community composition  largely through their influence on patterns of community dominance  We also found that interannual climate variation mediated the effects of climate change treatments on plant community composition  Long term field experiments  such as the PHACE experiment  help reveal complex  and in our case  nonlinear responses to climate change that propagate through plant communities  These responses include both compositional shifts and changes in community dominance structure  with important consequences for the structure and function of these semi arid grasslands       
Latitudinal gradients in individual specialization	  The increase in the number of species with decreasing latitude is a striking pattern of global biodiversity  An important feature of the study on this pattern up to now is the focus on species as the fundamental unity of interest  neglecting potential within species ecological diversity  Here  we took a new perspective on this topic by testing for the existence of a latitudinal gradient of within species niche diversification  We reviewed the literature in search of case studies in which the variation in the niche attributes  prey taxa consumed  foraging behaviour  and microhabitat use  of individuals belonging to the same population  individual specialization  was quantified  We used ordinal linear regression to test the relationship between individual specialization and latitude We found 117 populations belonging to 62 animal species spanning a latitudinal gradient from 54 o S to 63 o N  We found a negative relationship between the degree of individual specialization and latitude  indicating that lower latitude populations contain more ecologically diverse assemblages of individuals  Our results add a new level of complexity to our understanding of global patterns of biodiversity  indicating that not only are there more species at lower latitudes  but also individuals within their populations are more ecologically diverse  Within population niche variation creates frequency dependence conducive to disruptive selection and sympatric speciation  Our results  therefore  suggest a new mechanism underlying higher diversification rates and therefore higher species diversity in the tropics       
Ecological drivers of intrapopulation niche variation There is extensive evidence that some species of ecological generalists  which use a wide diversity of resources  are in fact heterogeneous collections of relatively specialized individuals  This within population variation  or     individual specialization      is a key requirement for frequency dependent interactions that may drive a variety of types of evolutionary diversification and may influence the population dynamics and ecological interactions of species  Consequently  it is important to understand when individual specialization is likely to be strong or weak  In this talk I will review current theoretical and empirical work and ask what are the ecological drivers of intra population niche partitioning Empirical work  experiments and comparative studies  mainly confirms the theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among individual diet variation depends on the level of intra  and interspecific competition  ecological opportunity and predation  Specifically  it has been shown that increased intra specific competition is increasing among individual diet variation whereas inter specific competition is reducing among individual diet variation  Generally  the effect on among individual diet variation from competition  intra and inter  comes from resource competition  Predation on the other hand can limit among individual diet variation by restricting its prey to certain habitats or resources  These results show that among individual diet variation can be affected by a suite of ecological factors in nature  but the interactions between these factors  competition and predation  is poorly investigated  Furthermore  whether greater among individual diet variation translates into greater genetic variation  ability to evolve  or ecological stability remains to be determined       
Using network models to reveal underlying processes leading to the organization of individual variation in resource use	  Intrapopulational variation is a common pattern found in nature  It can be caused by many factors such as differences related to sex  morphology  environment and genetics  As a consequence  individuals within a population can exploit resources differently  Individual resource networks represent the feeding interaction between individuals and the resources they consume and are used to explore distinct ways in which individuals vary in resource use  Our goal is to generate quantitative predictions about the structure of individual resource networks  connecting the observed structural patterns with possible mechanisms leading to variation in resource use within populations  We investigated three models describing individuals exploiting resources  individuals sharing the same rank preference for prey  but differing in their willingness to accept new resources  individuals sharing the same top ranked resource and relying upon different alternative resources  or individuals having distinct preferences on their rank sequence  We studied the network structure that would arise under each model using individual resource networks from two populations of the snail Nucella sp   two populations of the snail Thais sp   and one population of the Cocos finch Pinaroloxias inornata   We compare each models   performance in reproducing features of empirical networks  such as nestedness and modularity  and evaluated the models   fit The models investigated generate different network topologies  For instance  a nested pattern of interaction  in which the preys consumed by specialist individuals are a subset of the preys consumed by generalists  is found when individuals share the same rank preference  On the other hand  a modular pattern  in which few individuals form groups with similar diets  is found when individuals differ in their alternative prey choices and when they differ in their rank sequence  The model that presented the worst performance was the one that predicts shared preferences among individuals  For P  inornata and the two populations of Thais sp   the model with best performance was the one that predicts the same top ranked prey and different alternative prey choices  For the two populations of Nucella sp  the model with best performance was the one that predicts different rank preference for preys  Our approach highlights the importance of generating quantitative predictions in order to accurately define and differentiate possible mechanisms leading to variation in resource use       
 Populations and communities affect individual dietary patterns of bullfrogs  Lithobates catesbeianus  Ecologists often overlook individual patterns of diet in predators that are considered generalists  However  many species with broad diets on the species level may be composed of individuals that specialize  A large body of research has shown that individual specialization  IS  can influence population and community dynamics  for example by decreasing intraspecific competition  increasing species persistence  and increasing species coexistence  However  less work has focused on how population and community dynamics affect IS  Here  we describe diets from individual bullfrogs  Lithobates catesbeianus  using stable isotope analysis  SIA  on whole blood  With that information  we A  measured IS using the proportional similarity  PS  index  and B  tested the hypotheses that intraspecific competition      high bullfrog densities  and resource diversity both increase IS  We measured density by conducting 20 minute scan searches of ponds shortly after dark and then dividing the number of bullfrogs by the area of the pond  We used a linear model to test the effects of density on IS  We collected potential prey with sweep nets and pitfall traps  and we measured resource diversity with the Shannon Weaver index  We used a linear permutation model to test the effects of resource diversity on IS Lithobates catesbeianus individuals varied widely in PS values from 0 65 to 0 97 and were statistically different from one  t=7 55  df=15  p   0 001   indicating strong IS  We found support for both our hypotheses regarding the effect of populations and communities on IS  Frogs at ponds with a greater density of conspecifics showed more IS  F=5 946  df= 1 14  p =0 02868  R 2 =0 248   Frogs captured at ponds with higher resource diversity also had more IS  F=8 587  df=1 14  p =0 01096  R 2 =0 3359   Furthermore  we showed that IS can be influenced at the population level by intraspecific competition and at the community level by resource diversity  This is the first study to directly test the influence of resource diversity on IS  While previous studies on IS have shown that individuals can affect populations and communities  our study demonstrates that populations and communities can affect individual dietary patterns  This suggests potential feedbacks between individual actions and higher levels of ecological organization and that IS needs to be increasingly included in studies of population dynamics and ecological communities       
The importance of context on the prevalence of individual diet specialization  the interaction between intra specific competition and habitat The recognition and quantification of individuality is now a common research theme in the fields of behavioral  evolutionary  community  and population ecology  Individual level differences in behavior  prey choice  and movement have been documented over a wide variety of taxa and ecosystems  The potential for individuality in a population is likely context dependent  and the influence of habitat characteristics  which can be strongly correlated with  prey  diversity  on the prevalence of individuality has received less attention than competition  We examined individual diet specialization in ~15 sea otter   Enhydra lutris   populations across the entire northeast Pacific margin from southern California to the central Aleutian Islands  Alaska  Because exploitation/management histories and general habitat characteristics vary among these sites  we could examine the effects of prey diversity/availability and intra specific competition on the prevalence of individual diet specialization  We used observational dietary data to quantify prey diversity and characterize relative habitat availability  We primarily relied on stable isotope data to quantify population and individual dietary variation and individuality  As in previous isotope based studies of individuality  we defined the within individual component  WIC  as the amount of intra individual isotopic variation and the total isotopic niche width as the sum of the WIC and between individual components  BIC  Using observational diet data  we classified half of our sites as rocky substrate habitats  while the others contained a mixture of rocky substrate and soft sediment habitats  Previous studies have shown that in rocky substrate habitats in California  individuality increases with intra specific competition as measured by sea otter density  Our results  which include data for 8 rocky substrate sites from southern California to the central Aleutians  support previous findings  Specifically  the slope of the relationship between the within individual component  WIC  and total isotopic niche width  TINW  was low  0 24  but significant  P  0 001  R 2 =0 90   Furthermore  population dietary diversity  TINW  was positively correlated with sea otter density  In contrast  the slope of the significant relationship  P  0 001  R 2 =0 95  between WIC and TINW for otter populations inhabiting mixed substrate sites was much higher  0 50   suggesting a low degree of individuality irrespective of competition      sea otter density   Our results show that the potential for individuality to occur as a result of increasing intra specific competition is context dependent and that habitat characteristics  which ultimately influence prey diversity and abundance  are important in determining when and where individual specialization occurs in nature       
Effects of time averaged sampling on the inferred strength and temporal consistency of intraspecific diet specialization Animal populations often consist of individuals that vary substantially in their diets  Quantification of the strength and temporal consistency of such intraspecific diet specialization is needed to understand its effects on predator prey dynamics and community structure  Two approaches    stable isotope ratios and gut contents analysis    predominate the literature but are limited by potential biases that may alter estimates of specialization  The extent to which these approaches reflect instantaneous to highly time averaged measures of an individual  s diet is of particular concern  We used direct foraging observations of southern sea otters   Enhydra lutris nereis   to avoid these limitations and thereby quantify the strength and consistency of individual diet specialization over time  Our study indicates limited short term predictability but remarkably high long term consistency of individual sea otter diets  For an average individual  and when prey identity alone is considered  the diet similarity of two foraging bouts is only 0 46  on a scale of 0 to 1  for back to back bouts  but remains more than half as similar for over 900 elapsed days thereafter  The back to back similarity of the average individual  s diet is reduced to 0 42 but remains similarly consistent in the long term     500 elapsed days  when relative prey frequencies are also considered  Individual specialization remains distinguishable from the population  s between individual variation in diet choices for periods of 500 3000 days  Analyses of observations aggregated over hourly to annual intervals of time reveal a substantial bias associated with time averaged approaches  Time averaging affects a marked increase in the inferred strength of an individual  s short term diet similarity  However  it does not affect the inferred strength of long term diet consistency  Our study thus provides quantitative insights into the utility of instantaneous and time averaged approaches for understanding intraspecific diet variation and its effects on populations and community dynamics       
MixSIAR  A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model for characterizing intrapopulation niche variation	  The science of stable isotope mixing models has tended towards the development of modeling products  e g  IsoSource  MixSIR  SIAR   where methodological advances or syntheses of the current state of the art are published in parity with software packages  However  while mixing model theory has recently been extended to incorporate hierarchical structure in mixture populations  e g  tropic niche partitioning across levels of population structure   no existing mixing model tool currently accounts for such structure  Here we introduce MixSIAR  a new GUI tool based on the R statistical computing platform  MixSIAR is unique in that it incorporates both fixed and random effects associated with the mixture population  MixSIAR provides researchers a consolidated analytic framework for addressing hierarchical structure in mixing model analyses  To demonstrate to tool  we show an application to a source/mixture system with multiple levels of structure in the mixing population  Through this example  we outline novel mixing model approaches for characterizing intrapopulation niche variation though variance decomposition  We also outline   best practices   associated with data collection and analysis when applying mixing models studies to systems with hierarchical structure       
Use of stable isotopes to estimate the dietary responses of black bears to changing management regimes in Yosemite National Park We used carbon   d 13 C  and nitrogen   d 15 N  stable isotopes to investigate the dietary plasticity of black bears   Ursus americanus   that foraged on anthropogenic foods  human foods  non native trout  over the past century in Yosemite National Park  The purpose of our study was to estimate proportional dietary contributions for bears through time and to use these parameter estimates to evaluate the human bear management program  We conducted stable isotope analysis on museum specimens  hair from bear pelts  and bone collagen from bear skulls and trout fins  collected in 1915  1985  We used these isotope values as well as isotope values derived from human hair collected over the past century and bear hair collected in 2001  2007 to estimate proportional dietary contributions for bears using the stable isotope mixing model  IsotopeR  We assumed that the average proportion of anthropogenic foods in the diets of bears was a proxy for the availability of these foods to the bear population  We used a novel Bayesian approach to compare anthropogenic dietary contributions among four time periods when different anthropogenic foods were available to bears in the park  We considered a decrease of human foods in the diets of bears between time periods as an indicator that management was successful in reducing the amount of human foods available to bears The diets of black bears changed significantly through time  suggesting a high level of dietary plasticity  The average contribution of human foods increased in diets of bears  13% to 27%  from 1915  1919 to 1928  1939 due to the park intentionally feeding bears at designated areas  the average contribution of trout did not increase  3% to 4%  during these time periods  Some bears might have overcompensated for the loss of protein rich trout from local fish hatcheries  1895 1956  and human foods at feeding areas  1923  1940  and open pit garbage dumps  1915 1970  by foraging on human foods in developed areas such as campgrounds and hotels  35%  1971  1998   In 1999  2007  the average proportion of human food decreased in bear diets  13%   suggesting the human bear management program was successful at reducing the availability of human foods to levels similar to those in the early 1900s  This result is remarkable considering the park received several thousand visitors each year in the early 1900s and nearly four million visitors each year today       
Individual specialization among generalist predators  Testing the assumptions of selective predator removal programs intended to enhance endangered prey populations Selective removal of   problem   predators is sometimes proposed as a means to enhance endangered prey populations  Justification for these lethal control programs rests on two key assumptions  1  only a specialized subset of the predator population is responsible for the conflict  and 2  that the conflict will cease after those individuals are removed  Many of these cases require prompt action and are of great public interest  e g   Galapagos sharks/Hawaiian monk seals  mountain lions/bighorn sheep  California sea lions/salmon   It is important to evaluate the factors influencing management success in these cases  In particular  to what degree does violating the aforementioned assumptions influence the long term success of management as it relates to increasing the size of an endangered prey population  A theoretical agent based model was developed in Netlogo 5 0 2 to test the effectiveness of selective removal programs in scenarios that differ in three key ways  1  the degree to which individual predators specialize on endangered prey  2  the mode by which individuals become specialized  and 3  the accuracy of lethal removal efforts Preliminary results suggest that the most important factor for management success is the accuracy of removal efforts  When managers accurately identify and remove predators that are repeatedly consuming endangered prey  there is a significant increase in the endangered prey population  In contrast  there are marked declines in the endangered prey population across all scenarios involving imperfect management in which randomly encountered predators are removed without knowing whether they have been consistently consuming endangered prey  The degree to which predators specialize on endangered prey      their willingness to supplement their diet with alternative prey  is only important in cases when removal is accurate and predators specialize in endangered prey after multiple successful encounters with them  Contrary to expectations  the mode of predator specialization      whether the predator becomes specialized via genetic inheritance  learning from experience  or random chance  does not significantly influence management success in the context of this analysis  Further model development and analyses are warranted  however  these interim results suggest that the success of selective predator removal programs intended to enhance endangered prey populations is more dependent on accurate identification of problem individuals than the degree and mode of their specialization in endangered prey       
Interactions at the individual scale control forest response to climate change	  The recent global increase in forest mortality episodes could not have been predicted from current vegetation models that are calibrated to regional climate data  Physiological studies show that mortality results from interactions between climate and competition at the individual scale  Models of forest response to climate do not include interactions because they are hard to estimate and require long term observations on individual trees obtained at frequent  annual  intervals  A new demographic approach provides estimates of climate competition interactions in two critical ways  1  among individuals  as a joint distribution of responses to combinations of inputs  such as resources and climate  and 2  within individuals  due to allocation requirements that control outputs  such as demographic rates  Dynamic inverse prediction  DIP  was implemented to identify variables most critical for individual responses  Application to 20 years of data from climate and competition gradients shows that interactions control forest demographic responses  and their omission from models leads to inaccurate predictions  Growth  maturation  fecundity  and survival inferred from 40 000 individual trees across climate gradients from northern Hardwoods to SE Piedmont spanned several extreme droughts  Competition varied among individuals due to canopy manipulation  Species most vulnerable to increasing aridity are not those that show the largest growth response to precipitation  but rather depend on interactions with the local resource environment  Aggregating individual DIP results identifies the species at greatest risk from drought  having sensitivities as large as the risks from light competition  These include Tsuga  Cercis  Fagus   Pinus taeda  P  rigida  and P  echinata  Individual interactions further identify where and how landscape variation in moisture mediates responses to climate  This first assessment of regional species vulnerability that is based on the scale at which climate operates  individual trees competing for carbon and water  supports predictions of potential savannification in the southeastern US
